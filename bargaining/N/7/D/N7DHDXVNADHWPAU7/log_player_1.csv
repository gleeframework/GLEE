"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm making a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think 600k is a fair share for my efforts. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Bob is offering me $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I was initially looking for a 50/50 split, but this offer is lower than that.

However, considering the inflation factor, the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, so his share of 600,000 is actually equivalent to 480,000 in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 40% of the original amount, I'll try to counter with a higher percentage. I'll aim for a 55% share for myself, which is a bit higher than the initial 50/50 split.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% of the original amount, a slight concession from my initial 50/50 proposal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway from my initial offer, but I think 55% is a fairer share for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but his share is still higher than my initial proposal.

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is equivalent to 520,000 in the first round, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. However, I'm still not convinced that 55% is a fair share for him.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually higher than my initial 50/50 split, which I had considered a fair share. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or try to push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 55% of the original amount, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher percentage, aiming for 60% of the original amount. This will give me a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise to try to reach a deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% of the original amount, but I think 60% is a fairer share for me.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 48% is still a fair share for me, considering the value of money has decreased. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to adjust his offer to account for the inflation, but his share is still higher than my initial proposal.

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is equivalent to 160,000 in the first round, which is a significant decrease from his previous offer. However, I'm still not convinced that 48% is a fair share for him.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually higher than my initial 50/50 split, which I had considered a fair share. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or try to push for a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was 48% of the original amount, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher percentage, aiming for 52% of the original amount. This will give me a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise to try to reach a deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 48% of the original amount, but I think 52% is a fairer share for me.""
}
```

This offer is actually identical to Bob's previous offer, but I'm framing it as a concession from my initial 60% proposal. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
