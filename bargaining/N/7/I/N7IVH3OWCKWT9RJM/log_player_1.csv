"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to make a good first impression and give Bob a decent share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my calculation. The actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $6,000
Bob gain: $4,000

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7,000 is a fair amount for me. You'll get 3,000, which is still a decent share.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the game going. I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target. I think we can meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less in the fourth round, I'll have to adjust my calculation. The actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $5,417.32
Bob gain: $5,417.32

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, as I'd like to get a bit more. However, I'm also not sure if I want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 50/50 it is. I'll take the $5,417.32 and call it a day.""
}
```"
