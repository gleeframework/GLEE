"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly. Let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to accept a 40-60 split just yet. I'd like to see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to think strategically!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
