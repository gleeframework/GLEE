Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $10 and keep $90 for myself.  It's a bit greedy, but I want to see how he reacts and whether he'll accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  The value of my potential gains in the next round would be further reduced by inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better. It's time to secure what I can."
