"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd be getting 300,000, which is 30% of the original 1,000,000. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth 80% of its original value, so he's getting 560,000 in ""real"" value.

I'll accept this offer.
