"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This way, I'll get a decent chunk of money and Bob will get a smaller but still reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value quickly!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 70% of the current value of $100 (after 10% inflation in the first round and 10% inflation again in the second round) is approximately $56.90
Bob's gain: 30% of the current value of $100 (after 20% inflation in the first round and 20% inflation again in the second round) is approximately $23.10

I'm not sure if this is the best offer I can get, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
