"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my 500,000 gain is now worth 475,000, and Bob's 500,000 gain is now worth 630,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 300,000 gain, which is worth 285,000 after inflation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so it's worth 95% of 475,000, which is 452,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in round 4. Initially, my gain was 500,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, it's worth 500,000 * (0.95)^3 = 433,787.5.

Now, Bob's offer is 150,000 for me and 850,000 for him. Considering the inflation effect, my 150,000 gain is worth 433,787.5 * 0.732 (1 - 0.268) = 316,525.92, and Bob's 850,000 gain is worth 850,000 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277) = 614,550.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a gain that's worth less than my current gain.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, my gain is worth 5% less than in round 4, so it's worth 95% of 316,525.92, which is 300,499.66.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
