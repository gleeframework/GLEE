"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my proposed gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd actually gain $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd gain $5,000, which is worth 80% of $6,000, and Bob would gain $5,000, which is worth 90% of $5,500.

I think this is a reasonable compromise, so I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
