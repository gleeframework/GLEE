Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to share fairly, but my patience wears off 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a better deal and willing to push closer to the later rounds if necessary."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a serious offer, let's close the deal.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. My share goes up 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerous. While accepting would still net me something, Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage and becoming more aggressive.  Rejecting sends a strong signal that I won't be bullied into a bad deal, even this late in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop the games. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's your final offer, but I'm still here. My share goes up again 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer is disastrous. Accepting a smaller share now is better than getting nothing in the later rounds."
