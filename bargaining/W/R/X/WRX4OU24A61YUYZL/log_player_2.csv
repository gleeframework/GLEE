"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to take slightly less to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a fair split sounds tempting, I can do better if I play it strategically.  I want to see how far Alice is willing to go."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'm offering you a fair deal, but remember, every round the money loses value faster for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  It's clear we both want a good deal, and this is the most equitable way to move forward without risking losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting.  It seems like we're both starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I don't want to risk losing out on anything more."
