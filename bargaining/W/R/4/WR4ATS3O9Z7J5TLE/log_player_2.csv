"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Since I am playing as Bob, I want to maximize my gains.  The current offer isn't bad, but there's potential for a better deal in the future, especially as the money's value decreases for me with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's be fair, but also acknowledge that the value of the money changes each round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than last time. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though Alice is accounting for inflation, her offer is still less than the initial offer. I am hoping that she will be willing to increase her offer further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. With each round, my share of the money becomes less valuable.  Let's reach a compromise before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said last round was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance. This is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's disappointing that my share continues to shrink due to inflation, Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far, especially considering the significant decrease in value for my gains. Accepting this offer is the most rational choice in this scenario."
