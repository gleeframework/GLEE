"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 7,000 dollars, leaving 3,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was in the first round. However, I still think it's a decent proposal. I'll accept this offer.
