# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less due to inflation, and Alice's offer is still 50.5/49.5, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share to account for the reduced value of my gain. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer was 50.5/49.5, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth 59.04% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Considering Alice's offer is still 66.67/33.33, I'll try to get a better deal. However, the difference in value between our offers is not as significant as the inflation, so I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
