Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split in my favor, recognizing your concern about the decreasing value of money. This offer is fair and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
