"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share, but I'm looking for a majority stake.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my effective gain in this round is 4000 * 0.95 = 3800.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
