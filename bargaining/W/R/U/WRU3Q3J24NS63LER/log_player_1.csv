I'm going for a pretty generous offer in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation.  5000 is better than nothing!"
