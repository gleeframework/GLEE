"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the risk of inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think an even split is the fairest way to start. We both get the same amount, and it's a good starting point to work from. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that an even split is the fairest way to start. Since I'm already facing a 20% decrease in the value of my potential gain due to inflation, I think I should aim for a slightly higher share. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly higher share due to the inflation risk. This offer is a fair compromise, considering the current situation.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob receives the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
