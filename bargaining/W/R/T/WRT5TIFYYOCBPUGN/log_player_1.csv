I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This way, I maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though the money is worth less now, I'm getting 2000$ which is still better than nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers. The inflation effect is too significant to risk another round."
