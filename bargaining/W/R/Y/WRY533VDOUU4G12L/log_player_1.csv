Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split. It allows us both to benefit substantially. Time is ticking, and the pot is shrinking! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
