Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This reflects the value lost due to inflation, but also acknowledges your need for a more equitable share. Let's work together to reach an agreement before the money dwindles further.

# Alice gain: 5500
