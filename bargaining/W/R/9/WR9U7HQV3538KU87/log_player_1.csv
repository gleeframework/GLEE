"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both lose money each round. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically. Bob's offer is better than what I'll get if I reject and he offers me the minimum in Round 3.
