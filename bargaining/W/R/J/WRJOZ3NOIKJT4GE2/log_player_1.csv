"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me the majority of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $700,000 is worth even less than before. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. After considering the reduced value of the money, I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since my share is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 60-40 split. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
