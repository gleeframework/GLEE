"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60/40. You'll get a good amount, and I'll get a bit more since I'm making the offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. It's a fair deal, and we should settle before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than the previous round, and while I'd like to get more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Let's take it."
