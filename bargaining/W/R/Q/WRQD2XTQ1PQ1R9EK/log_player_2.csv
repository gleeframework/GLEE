Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's go for a 55/45 split. It's closer to even, and it gives us both a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of my decreasing gains. I need to hold out for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and my share keeps shrinking. 65/35 is my final offer.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's meet in the middle at 45/55. It's better than the 35/65 you offered and gives us a better chance of getting something before the money completely disappears. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses. Alice is likely to keep pushing for a better deal for herself, and my gains will keep shrinking. Accepting 55 now is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
