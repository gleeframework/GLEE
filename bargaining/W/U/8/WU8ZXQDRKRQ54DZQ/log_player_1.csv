"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This way, I get a significant portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the $500,000 now, even though it's worth 10% less than my original proposal.  The risk of waiting is too high, especially with inflation."
