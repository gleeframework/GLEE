"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is essentially the reverse of my original offer, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more balanced split, taking into account the reduced value of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
