Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  He'll get a dollar, but I'll take the rest. I'm hoping he'll accept this, as any future rounds mean my share will be worth less and less due to inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, it's clear that Bob is not willing to budge.  Accepting his offer means I get $500,000, which is a lot better than the $800,000 I would get if we go to round 3 due to inflation.  It's time to be practical and secure what I can."
