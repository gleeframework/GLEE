{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was quite bold, Alice. I'm willing to give you a better deal than the inevitable losses from future rounds, but I need a bigger piece of the pie.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor - a compromise that benefits us both more than dragging this out further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
