Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up 400k. I think I can do better than that.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than his previous offer, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance. Let's see how he responds!"

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to inch closer to a 55/45 split. I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to what I want. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm pushing for a 60/40 split, which I think is more in line with what I'm looking for. Let's see how Bob responds!"

  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on the numbers, let's make a deal""

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
