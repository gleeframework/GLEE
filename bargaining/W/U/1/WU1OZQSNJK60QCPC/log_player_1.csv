"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to be careful. If I accept this offer, I'll get $20, which is worth 10% less than the $60 I could have gotten in the previous round. On the other hand, Bob will get $80, which is the same as his previous offer.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much potential value, but I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 35/65!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $35 and Bob gets $65, which is a more modest offer than my previous one. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
