Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I think we can reach a compromise. This offer gives you more, but still leaves me a fair share. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

``` 

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Waiting longer means he'll get even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Offer:** While not as high as Bob's previous offer, 400,000 is still a significant sum. Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Receiving money now is always better than receiving it later, even if the amount is slightly lower. This principle is amplified in this scenario due to the high inflation rate Bob faces."
