"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a good deal, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my share of $200,000 is now worth $190,000.

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. I accept the offer.
