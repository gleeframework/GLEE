"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation disadvantage I will face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm proposing a split of 8500/1500 in my favor. This is still a decent gain for me considering the inflation, and it's a better offer than Bob's previous one. I believe this gives Bob a fair chance while still offering me a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take this offer, as my next proposal would be even lower than Bob's, and inflation would eat away at my gains."
