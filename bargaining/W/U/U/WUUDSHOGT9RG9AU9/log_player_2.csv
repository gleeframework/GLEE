Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 58-42. Take it before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to take a large chunk of the money, even with the inflation. It's worth holding out a little longer to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split doesn't account for the unequal inflation impact. This is a better compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is using the inflation argument to her advantage, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and see if I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a 48-52 split again.  Let's be practical and take what we can get before it shrinks further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is becoming a factor. While ideally, I'd want a more equitable split, repeating my previous offer of 48-52 highlights the urgency.  It's a compromise, but hopefully, one that Alice will accept before inflation eats away at the value any further."
