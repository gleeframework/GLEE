"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both lose value over time. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases over time, accepting 45% of the initial amount in the second round doesn't seem like the best option for me. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can come up with a more favorable division. Keep in mind that the decreasing value of money affects me more than Bob, so I'll try to find a balance between getting a fair share and minimizing the loss due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share than in the previous round, while still trying to find a mutually acceptable division. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer or if we'll proceed to the next round."
