Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but for Bob, the value remains the same. I rejected Bob's offer in Round 2, which proposed a 40-60 split in his favor.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on my gain
Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each passing round, I need to adjust my proposal to account for this decrease in value. In Round 1, I proposed a 60-40 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, I should adjust my proposal to ensure I get a fair share after accounting for the decrease in value.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted proposal
Given the 20% decrease in value for my gain, I should increase my proposed share to compensate for the loss. However, I also need to be cautious not to propose a split that Bob would find unacceptable, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

### Step 4: Formulate a message to Bob
I should include a message explaining my reasoning and showing willingness to negotiate. This might encourage Bob to accept my proposal or make a more favorable counteroffer.

### Step 5: Create the JSON response
Based on the above steps, I will create a JSON response with my adjusted proposal and a message to Bob.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}"
