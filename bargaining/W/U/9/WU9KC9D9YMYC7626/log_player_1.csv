"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split."
