"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum, Bob. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take my chances with the inflation and see if I can negotiate a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly. This offer gives us both a substantial amount, and hopefully avoids the risk of losing it all to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a good compromise. Let's be sensible and take it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. While Alice's offer is reasonable, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, with time running out, let's be fair and split the money evenly. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and avoids the risk of losing everything to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an even split, but that's not realistic with the inflation working against you. This is my final offer - let's secure something before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer an even split, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to get a better deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount, and prevents the risk of losing everything entirely."
