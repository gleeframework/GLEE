"Round 1
Alice's offer:

""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I propose a 65/35 split. We both get a decent amount, and it's fairer considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation she faces. By rejecting, I'm betting she'll become more willing to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
