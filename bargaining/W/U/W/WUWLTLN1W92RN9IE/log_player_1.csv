"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6000 and Bob gets 4000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that he deserves a larger share because he took the risk of rejecting my offer. I think a 60-40 split is already quite generous to him, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50, a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a compromise between the original 60-40 split and the 40-60 split that Bob was trying to get. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
