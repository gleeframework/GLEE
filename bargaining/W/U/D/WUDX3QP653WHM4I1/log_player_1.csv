"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000.

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
