Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, I'll take a bit more than half, leaving you with a decent share. This seems fair, considering the inflation we'll both face. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
