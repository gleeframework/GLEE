Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your starting offer, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation rate is higher for you. Let's try that instead.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is affecting both of us. 55/45 is a fair compromise considering we both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
