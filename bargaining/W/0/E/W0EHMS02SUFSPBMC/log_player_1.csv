"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer from Bob. I'd rather not accept it. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a big advantage! I'm not comfortable with this offer at all. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I'll try to find a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
