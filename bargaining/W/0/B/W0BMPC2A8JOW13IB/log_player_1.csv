"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $4,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually a bit more valuable to me now.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
