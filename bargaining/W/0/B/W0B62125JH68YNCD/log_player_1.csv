Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's the best way to ensure both of us get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to maximize your share, but I'm also losing value with each passing round. This offer gives you a good amount, but also allows me to keep a larger share before the value depreciates further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the value of his potential winnings decreases. While his offer isn't terrible, I'm aiming to secure at least $6,000.  I'm betting he'll become more willing to negotiate as we approach the later rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sticking to my initial offer.  It's a fair deal, and we're running out of time. Let's close this out and both benefit."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. It's crucial to emphasize the shrinking pot.
* **Consistency:**  Repeating my original offer reinforces that I'm serious and have a firm bottom line.
* **Bob's Declining Position:**  His offers are getting worse for him, indicating a level of desperation.  He may be more likely to accept my offer now than before."
