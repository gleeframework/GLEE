"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to aim for a more balanced split. Giving me $4,000 and taking $6,000 for himself is still too skewed in his favor. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although he's given me a bit more, the gap between our gains is still too large. I'd like to aim for a more balanced split. I'll wait for a better offer."
