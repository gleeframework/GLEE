"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure if I should accept this 50/50 split. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd be getting 400,000 in real value, which is less than my initial offer of 800,000. But on the other hand, Bob is also getting less in real value, 500,000, which is less than his initial offer of 500,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a new proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation that has already occurred:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than before, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain."
