"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll try to be cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Taking into account the inflation, my offer from round 1 was worth 60, but now it's worth 48 (60 * 0.8) due to 20% less. I'll make a new offer that's a bit more generous than my initial one, considering the decreased value of money.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since my initial offer of 60 was worth 48.8% less, it would be worth around 31.2 in this round. Considering Bob's offer, it seems fair, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
