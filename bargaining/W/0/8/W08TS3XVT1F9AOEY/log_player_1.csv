"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my target gain has decreased accordingly.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less in the third round, my target gain is even lower now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which I hope will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'll wait for a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my target gain is significantly lower now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, let's meet at 52.5-47.5!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, finally! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a lot less now, and Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like we've finally reached a mutually acceptable agreement. I'll take 500,000 and Bob will take 500,000."
