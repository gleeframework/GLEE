Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced that the 80/20 split is fair, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
