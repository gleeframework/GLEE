"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping for a better deal later 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this proposal. If I accept, I'll get 20% of the original 100 dollars, which is 20 dollars. However, due to inflation, Bob's 80% share is worth 10% less than his original share, so he'll get 72 dollars (80% of 100 - 10%).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better deal. For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite unfavorable, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you a small chance to get something, but I'm taking a bigger share this time!""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. This is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late and we should settle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time around. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this proposal carefully.

If I accept, I'll get 50% of the original 100 dollars, which is 50 dollars. This is a decent share, and it's getting late in the game. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, so I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
