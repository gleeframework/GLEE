"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away the whole thing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation factor means I should aim for a larger share in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is in order. I'm willing to offer you 400,000, but I'll need the remaining 600,000 for myself.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share, and I can still make a good profit despite the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take a toll.  Alice's offer is fair, and I can still come away with a substantial gain.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
