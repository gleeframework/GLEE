"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good start 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider that when making my decision. With the offer of $4,000, I'll have to adjust for the inflation.

Considering the inflation, the $4,000 I'll gain is equivalent to $4,000 / 0.9 = $4,444.44 in the first round's value.

While it's not a bad offer, I'm not thrilled about the significant difference in the split. I was hoping for a more even split.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slightly more balanced split, considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the inflation and the initial offer from Bob."
