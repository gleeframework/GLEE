"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject his offer and try to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're getting a good deal, but I'm not going to let you take all the profit!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll aim for a better split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll meet you halfway, but don't expect me to give in completely.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not done yet 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to squeeze out a better deal!

I'll think carefully about this offer... Hmm, it's a 45-55 split, which is closer to my previous offer, but still not quite there. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still trying to take a bit too much, Bob. I'm not done negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on Bob's share, I'll try to take a firmer stance. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not budging much more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to split the difference 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise!

A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, considering the effects of inflation. I think I can live with this deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. You've worn me down. Let's split the difference and call it a day!""
}
```"
