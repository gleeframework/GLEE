Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it still leaves something for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, as the inflation will start to affect the value of the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share in this round, it's still better than rejecting and facing another round of inflation.  The money is worth less now, and I don't want to risk getting even less.  I'll accept this offer and get something, rather than nothing."
