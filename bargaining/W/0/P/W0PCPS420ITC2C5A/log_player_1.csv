I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good deal early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up that easily. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, offering a slightly lower share for myself than in round 1, but still ensuring a significant portion of the money. Inflation is a factor, but I believe I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired share, it's still not enough considering the significant inflation impact on my share.  I'll reject this offer and keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to close the gap and see if Bob is willing to accept a more balanced split.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still hopeful we can find a compromise."

# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more unfavorable due to the inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I still have time to negotiate and hopefully find a more equitable split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
