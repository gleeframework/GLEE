"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, suggesting a 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll receive $40, but its value is equivalent to $32 in Round 1 terms.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in Round 1, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for the loss in value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller edge, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value of the money I gain, I need to be careful. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, I'll calculate the equivalent value in Round 1 terms.

The $45 I'd gain in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $23.15 in Round 1 terms.
