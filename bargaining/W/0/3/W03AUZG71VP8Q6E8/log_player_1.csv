"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total. This is a decent starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can split the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to think carefully. Given that my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this offer is actually slightly more favorable to me. I'll accept this offer.
