# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can adjust later if needed.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the inflation.""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will accept this offer before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. We're both losing money due to inflation. I propose a 50/50 split. It's the only way we both get anything close to our original amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair at this point, considering the inflation. I'd rather accept this offer than risk losing more value in the next round."
