"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40""}\n\nHow's that? I'm offering Bob a decent chunk of the money, while still taking the larger share for myself. The message is friendly and inviting, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly before inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, let's go 60/40, but I need the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it gives him the larger share and I had already proposed a similar division in the first round. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous proposals. By giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, and that we can come to a mutually agreeable solution. The message conveys this sentiment, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the inflation gets any worse."
