"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth waiting to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation is in my favor, and with multiple rounds remaining, there's potential to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation advantage I have in the later rounds.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split the money evenly.  This way we both get a fair amount, and we don't need to risk losing it all to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to see if I can get more, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer, especially given the risk of losing everything due to inflation."
