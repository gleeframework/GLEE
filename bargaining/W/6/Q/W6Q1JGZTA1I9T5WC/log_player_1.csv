"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 800,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, I would gain $100,000, which is worth 80% of the original $800,000 I would have gained in the first round. This means I'm effectively gaining $80,000 in real terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
