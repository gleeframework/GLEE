Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair share. Considering the inflation, I propose a split of $560,000 for me and $440,000 for you. This is a compromise between our previous offers and acknowledges the increasing impact of inflation as time passes. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000
