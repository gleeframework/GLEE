Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position in the first round, but I believe a more equitable split is in order.  Let's split the difference from your initial offer with me receiving $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This factors in the inflation impact for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
