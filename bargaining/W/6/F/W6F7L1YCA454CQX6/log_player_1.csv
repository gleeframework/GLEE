I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining $300,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000.
