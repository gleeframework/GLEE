I propose a split of $999,999 for me and $1 for Bob.  I think this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one proposing first. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

``` 

I'm going to offer Bob $2 this time.  I'm hoping he sees that it's in his best interest to accept, since if he rejects this, he'll be stuck with the risk of getting nothing in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take $2 than risk getting nothing at all. I'll accept Bob's offer."
