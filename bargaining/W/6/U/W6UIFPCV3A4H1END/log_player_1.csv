Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  It's a lot of money, but I figure he'll be more likely to accept it than if I try to take it all.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine was, and with the inflation, it makes sense to accept it. Half a million is still a huge amount of money, and it's better than risking it all to try and get more!"
