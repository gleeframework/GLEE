Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean Bob gets significantly less than half the pot.  It's worth pushing our luck a little further, as Alice's next offer might be more reasonable given the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take this deal, or we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, with only 6 rounds remaining. This offer is Bob's last attempt to secure a somewhat reasonable amount before the effects of inflation make it pointless to continue. By framing it as a final offer, it might push Alice to accept and avoid losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. Ideally, Bob wouldn't accept anything less than 4000, but the rapidly increasing inflation is making it impossible to hold out. Accepting this offer is the last chance to get anything substantial. If rejected, the next offer from Alice will likely be even worse, and the remaining rounds might not be enough to recover."
