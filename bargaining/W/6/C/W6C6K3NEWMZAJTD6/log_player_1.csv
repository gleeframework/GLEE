Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you take the easy way out. It's time to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate. I'm not backing down. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, inflation is making each round worse for me.  It's better to accept and secure some money, even if it's less than I'd prefer."
