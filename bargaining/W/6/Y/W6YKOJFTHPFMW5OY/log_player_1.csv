Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is working in my favor. While his offers are getting larger, they are not increasing quickly enough to make up for the inflation he is facing.  I will continue to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Take it before inflation hurts you further!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  It's time to apply more pressure. Bob is feeling the heat of inflation, and I need to emphasize that every round lost is a loss for him. 
* **Fairness Anchor:**  Offering a 50/50 split creates the image of a fair deal. Even though I've been aiming for a slightly larger share, presenting this now can make Bob reconsider his stance.
* **Inflation Factor:** While I'm not getting my ideal amount, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse deal in later rounds as Bob's share loses value."
