Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think we can both agree that inflation is hurting us both, and this is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll accept this offer since the money is losing value quickly, and it's better to settle now rather than risk further losses."
