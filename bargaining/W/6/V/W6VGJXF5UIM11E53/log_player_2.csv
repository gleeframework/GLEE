"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both move on.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Consider the depreciation - a good deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and yours is depreciating quickly. This is my final offer before I aim for an even bigger slice of the pie. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this 55/45 split, or I will be forced to go even lower in the next round.  Don't push your luck further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance to get a reasonable share. The clock is ticking, and your money is evaporating. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's a matter of cutting my losses. Accepting $350,000 is significantly better than risking another round where my position weakens, and Alice is clearly playing hardball.
