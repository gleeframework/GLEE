I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 400k, it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think about whether 400,000 is a good deal for me.

For now, I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to do better!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting even stingier! Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether 450,000 is a good deal for me.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth less than before, I'll have to be more cautious. However, I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving up more money.

For now, I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to do better!

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! The money he's offering is worth a fraction of what it was in the first round, and I'm still getting a relatively small share.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth much less than before, I think I can do better. I'm not going to accept this offer, and I'll try to negotiate again.

# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh boy, Bob's offer is getting laughable! The money he's offering is worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round, and I'm getting a paltry 150,000.

At this point, I think it's clear that Bob is trying to lowball me, and I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate again.

Here's my revised proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""}
