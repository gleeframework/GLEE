"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the 60$ Bob is offering is actually worth 48$ to me, which is less than my initial 50$. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40$ for me and 60$ for him, and considering the inflation, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer for myself. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the 52$ Bob is offering is actually worth 26.4$ to me, which is less than my initial 50$. However, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think I should accept this offer to avoid further erosion of my potential gains.
