"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message to try to convince Bob to accept my proposal. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want the larger share.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The money may be worth less now due to inflation, but I think I can get a better deal. It's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal. \n\n### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $475,000 and I'll take $525,000. I've included a message suggesting we meet in the middle to try to reach a deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nAs previously decided, I'll stick with my plan and propose the same offer as before: I'll take $525,000 and Bob will get $475,000. The message remains the same, ""Let's meet in the middle"". I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in compromising and accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
