Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being greedy and taking a large share, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted initially, the inflation makes it likely that I'll get even less if I reject and go to another round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
