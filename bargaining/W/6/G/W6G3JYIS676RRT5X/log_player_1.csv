"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself, with the message ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a strong position, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 80$, it's worth 80 * 0.8 = 64$ in the original value, which is a significant increase from my initial offer of 30$. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45$, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still trying to find a middle ground."
