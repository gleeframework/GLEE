"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I know there's inflation, but I figure it's better to get most of the money now and hope that Bob doesn't want to risk it all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, I'm not confident I can get a better offer in the next round. Inflation is a factor, and Bob's offer is at least fair."
