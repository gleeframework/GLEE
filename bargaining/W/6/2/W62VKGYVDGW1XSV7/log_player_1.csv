"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, the actual amounts I would gain are:
Alice gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (due to 20% inflation)

Considering the adjusted amounts, I think I should reject this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation rates:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.731 (27.1% less) = 5472.19
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.516 (48.8% less) = 11611.76

I think I should reject this offer, as the amount I would gain is significantly lower than what I would have gotten in the previous round, and the amount Bob would gain is much higher than what I would have gotten.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation rates:

Alice gain: 3000 / 0.591 (40.95% less) = 5063.38
Bob gain: 7000 / 0.326 (67.23% less) = 21461.45

I think I should reject this offer, as the amount I would gain is significantly lower than what I would have gotten in the previous round, and the amount Bob would gain is much higher than what I would have gotten.
