"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share, or if he'll try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting it."
