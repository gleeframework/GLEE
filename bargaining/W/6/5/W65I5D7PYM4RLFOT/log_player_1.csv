"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I want more for my efforts. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of $300,000 from the first round, which is $270,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of $700,000 from the first round, which is $665,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.
