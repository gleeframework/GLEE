"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate for me is relatively low, so I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens next.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My message is: I'll give you a bit more, but I want a larger share. My proposal is 5500 for me and 4500 for Alice.\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I want a larger share.""}\n\nPlease relay this to Alice. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer before the inflation gets too bad!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's in both our best interests to come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a good offer, considering the inflation. Splitting it evenly seems fair, and I don't want to risk the money being worth even less in the next round. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game here.\n\nLet Alice know that I accept her offer!"
