Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money will lose value for both of us in the next round.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
