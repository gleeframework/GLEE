"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice!  I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'll give you more in the next round if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I have to consider that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth $360,000 in the first round's value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better in the next round, considering the inflation effect. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the second round. Since I rejected Bob's offer, the total amount left is still $1,000,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll accept and we can wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  We can both walk away with a good amount.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, I have to consider that the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Since I rejected Bob's offer, the total amount left is still $1,000,000.

To calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round, I'll use the inflation factor: 0.727 (1 - 0.271). 

So, $500,000 in the fourth round is equivalent to $363,500 in the first round's value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than $363,500. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the fourth round, which means it's worth 54.2% of the original amount. To calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round, I'll use the inflation factor: 0.542 (1 - 0.271 - 0.271 * 0.727).

So, I'll propose a gain of $542,000, which is equivalent to $542,000 in the first round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 542000,
  ""bob_gain"": 458000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being realistic about the inflation, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $542,000 and Bob gets $458,000."
