"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $60 * 0.95 = $57. But I still think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has been eating away at my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for it.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really biting now. Considering the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'd be getting $60 * 0.8574 = $51.44. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the reduced value.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
