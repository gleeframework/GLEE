Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation hurts me more than you.  I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
