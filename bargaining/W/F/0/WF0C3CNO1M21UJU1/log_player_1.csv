"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'd be getting $400,000, but it's worth the same as $500,000 in the first round, which is a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it, considering Bob is getting $600,000, which is worth more than $500,000 in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for $600,000, I'll try to counteroffer with a slightly higher amount, considering the inflation effect. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60%!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but I'm still trying to keep some balance in the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the 48.8% decrease, Bob's offer is now worth significantly less than my previous offer.

Considering the current state of the economy, I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a decent deal given the circumstances.
