"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm looking for a good deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but it's worth 10% less for Bob. This means that the value of the money I gain is the same as in the first round, but the value of the money Bob gains is 10% less.

Since the offer is:

* Alice gain: 100,000
* Bob gain: 900,000

I can calculate the effective values as follows:

* Alice gain: $100,000 (same as in the first round)
* Bob gain: $810,000 (10% less than the original $900,000)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll play it safe and accept it. I'll take the $100,000 and call it a day.
