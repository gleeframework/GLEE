"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 99/1 split in favor of myself.  This is a generous offer, considering I could take everything.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, this is a fair split.  It's better to take half than risk getting nothing."
