{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer.
