"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so $8,000 is now worth $7,600 in terms of purchasing power.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so $7,600 is now worth $7,280 in terms of purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so $7,280 is now worth $6,254 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I think I'll have to consider it. After all, I don't want to risk getting nothing if I don't accept.
