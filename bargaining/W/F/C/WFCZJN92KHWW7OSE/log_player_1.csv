"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous share considering the initial amount. I'll get the remaining $900,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept this 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value in my share. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
