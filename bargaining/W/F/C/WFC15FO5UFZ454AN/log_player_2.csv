Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 3000 for me and 7000 for her, I'll try to do slightly better.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to adjust my expectations. Since Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my previous offer, I'll think carefully...
