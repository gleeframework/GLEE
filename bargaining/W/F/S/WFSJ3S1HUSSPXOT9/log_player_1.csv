I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting half instead of 90%, it's still a good deal for me.  Since I know Bob's gains are inflated, it's likely he'll be more aggressive in the next rounds, and I'll likely get a worse deal. It's better to take the 50 now!"
