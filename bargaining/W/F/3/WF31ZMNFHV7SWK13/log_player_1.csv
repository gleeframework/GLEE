```

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you can have 20. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2.
