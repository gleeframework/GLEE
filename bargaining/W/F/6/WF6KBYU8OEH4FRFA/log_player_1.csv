"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good chunk of the money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less now, I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll get $900,000 in the first round's offer, but now I'd get $810,000 in Bob's offer. That's a significant difference.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't accept my previous offer, so I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to get at least 400000 to make this worthwhile. If you accept, we can both walk away with a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll get $648,000 in the first round's offer, but now I'd get $432,000 in Bob's offer. That's a significant decrease.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit better than my previous one, and it's a fair deal considering the current value of the money. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
