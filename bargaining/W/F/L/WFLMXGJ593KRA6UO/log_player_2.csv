"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this time, but you can propose a better deal next round if you think you deserve more. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value drops too low. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing!""}\n\nSince I'm facing a 20% decrease in value with each round, I want to try to secure a significant portion of the funds early on. By offering a 60-40 split, I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise, taking into account the pressure the inflation puts on my side. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still the one facing inflation.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money's value is decreasing for me with each round, Alice's offer doesn't seem to take that into account fairly. Given the significant drop in value I'm facing, I need to push for a better deal to compensate for the loss. Let's move on to the next round and see if we can find a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer, but I still believe a closer split is fair.""}\n\nGiven the continuous drop in value for me, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges this disadvantage. By slightly adjusting my previous offer, I'm hoping Alice will recognize the compromise I'm making and consider it a reasonable deal. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to the end here.  I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to secure a fair share for myself. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice has increased her offer, the value of the money for me has decreased significantly due to inflation. Considering we are halfway through the rounds, I still believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable deal. The current offer doesn't sufficiently compensate for the loss in value I'm facing. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a better agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're halfway through, and considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I believe an equal split is the fairest deal at this point.""}\n\nGiven the substantial decrease in value for me and the fact that we're halfway through the negotiations, I'm proposing an equal split. This acknowledges the loss I'm facing due to inflation and represents a compromise, considering Alice's previous offers. I hope she'll see this as a reasonable and fair proposal, given the circumstances."
