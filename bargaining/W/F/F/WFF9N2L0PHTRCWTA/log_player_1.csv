I'm going to start by being generous and giving Bob a small amount. I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer, as he'll get something rather than nothing.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's tempting to get a quick $100,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds. Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor, and I know he'll feel the pressure of inflation as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair and I believe it will be more appealing to Bob now that he's experienced the effects of inflation."
