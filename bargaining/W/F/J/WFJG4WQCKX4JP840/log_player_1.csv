"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a split of 80/20 in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the inflation factor. Let's end this quickly and avoid further loss of value. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
