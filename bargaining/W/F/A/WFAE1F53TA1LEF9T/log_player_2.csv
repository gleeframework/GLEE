"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The 10% inflation rate is a significant concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for now. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, I think it's a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I risk losing more value. I'll accept this offer to secure my share."
