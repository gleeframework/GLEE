"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a fair 25% of the total amount. If you accept, we can split the money and be done with it.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. You can't expect to get 75% of the total amount! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, my share is worth 20% less than before, so I'd be getting $160,000 (200,000 * 0.8) in real value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to keep negotiating and risk getting an even worse deal. I'll accept this offer.
