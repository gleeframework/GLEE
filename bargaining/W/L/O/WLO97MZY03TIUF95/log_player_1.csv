"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the money will be worth less next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain staying the same value, but Bob's gain being worth 10% less, I think this offer is a good one. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
