"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain of 40 in Round 2 is equivalent to 50 in Round 1, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'll accept Bob's offer to get 40% of the money, which is still more than my initial proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
