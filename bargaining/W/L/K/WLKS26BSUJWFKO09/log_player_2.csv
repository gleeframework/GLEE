Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. We both need to be willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Although the 60/40 split is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The declining value hurts Alice more than Bob, so it's worthwhile to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a serious offer - 65/35. Let's close the deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50. The value is dropping fast, we need to be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best offer Bob is likely to get. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.
* **Declining Value:** While Alice is losing value faster, continuing to hold out risks getting an even worse deal later.  
* **Time Pressure:**  There are only a few rounds left, and failing to agree means both lose everything.

It's time for Bob to be pragmatic and secure a good deal while he still can."
