Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. Let's settle this now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, Alice is still consistently offering deals that heavily favor her. Accepting 35% when I could have potentially gotten a much larger share earlier is not ideal. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially leading her to offer a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is the best I can do. Take it before inflation eats away at your share too!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out here. This is my last offer above 50, take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The tide is turning. Alice is now acknowledging the pressure of inflation, even though it only affects me directly. Accepting 40% now guarantees a reasonable payout, while continuing the game carries increasing risk. If I reject this, her offers might drop drastically, leaving me with even less in the end."
