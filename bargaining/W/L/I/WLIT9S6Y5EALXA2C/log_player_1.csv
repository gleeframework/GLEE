"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. I'm keeping the remaining 70%. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we can work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain would be worth 95% of the original amount, which is $665,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since I was willing to offer you $300,000 in the first round. However, I'm willing to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too even for me. I'm willing to give you more, but I'd like to propose a slightly skewed split in my favor.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get you to come back with a revised offer that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 90.25% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still thinking about the initial proposal. Meet me in the middle, and I'll consider it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the current value of the money. The message is a friendly nudge to see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
