"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 30% share. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still thinking about the initial proposal. Meet me in the middle, and I'll consider it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer an even split, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. 450,000 is a decent gain, especially considering the inflation factor."
