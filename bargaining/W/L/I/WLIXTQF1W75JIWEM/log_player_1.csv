"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money to try to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, my gain of 5000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $9,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
