Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things more fairly, Alice. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking, and the stakes are getting lower. This is my final offer for a substantial sum.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. It accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to something reasonable, it's still skewed in his favor.  The longer we wait, the less powerful my position becomes due to inflation. However, I need to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but won't be pushed around. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time constraint. Let's be pragmatic and secure our shares.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation is eating into my potential gains, and waiting any longer risks getting nothing at all. Bob has shown he's willing to push this to the limit. Accepting now secures a reasonable, though not optimal, payout."
