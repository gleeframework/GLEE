"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but remember that the value of the remaining money decreases by 10% in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
