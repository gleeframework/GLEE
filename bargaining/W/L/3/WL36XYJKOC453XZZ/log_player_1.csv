"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but remember that the value of the remaining money decreases by 10% in each subsequent round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the inflation risk, I believe this is a fair offer given the reduced value of the money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
