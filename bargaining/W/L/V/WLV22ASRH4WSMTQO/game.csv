45.0,55.0,Let's be reasonable.  55/45 is a fair split considering we both lose some money with each round.  Let's agree to this and move on.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and this back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm willing to come down slightly to 52/48, but I need you to meet me halfway.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  52/48 is a fair compromise given the time constraint and the diminishing value of the money. Let's end this negotiation.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We are both losing money with every rejection.  Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. 50/50.",Alice,7,
