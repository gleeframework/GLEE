"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2,500. This ensures we both get a fair share while considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio, giving me a slightly larger share to compensate for the diminishing value of money. This way, we both get a decent share while still considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
