"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get a slightly bigger share this time, since you got the larger share last time.  Let's keep things moving! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but still giving Bob a significant share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
