"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $500,000, which is half of the total amount. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial sum of money, and we can avoid the hassle of negotiating further. What do you think, Bob?"
