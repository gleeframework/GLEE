"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new values, my gain of 50$ in this round is actually equivalent to 40$ in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 would be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the new values, my gain of 40$ in this round is actually equivalent to around 20.8$ in the first round. Bob's gain of 60$ is equivalent to around 27.2$ in the first round. I think I should accept this offer, as it's better than what I would get in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
