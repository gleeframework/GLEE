"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9000 for myself and giving $1000 to Bob.  This ensures I get the majority of the money, but also leaves Bob with something to consider. I'm curious to see if he'll accept this first offer or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation factor means that Bob's offer is likely the best I can get. Accepting this gives me a decent share and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
