"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too generous!

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less for me again. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $420,000, which is a slightly better deal for him, but still a good compromise for me. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll give you a bit more. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, Bob's message suggests this is his final offer, so I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $450,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
