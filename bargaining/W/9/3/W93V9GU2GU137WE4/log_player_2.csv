Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I'm still holding out for a better deal than this. Alice knows the pressure is on me, but accepting a deal where I get consistently less than 50% isn't ideal. It's a risk, but I'll counter-offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a fair compromise. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The value of the money is quickly decreasing for me. While this isn't a great deal, it's better than risking getting a worse outcome or even nothing if we run out of rounds."
