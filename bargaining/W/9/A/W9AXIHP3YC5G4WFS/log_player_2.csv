Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 your way is not acceptable.  How about a 55/45 split?  Inflation is eating away at the value, let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
