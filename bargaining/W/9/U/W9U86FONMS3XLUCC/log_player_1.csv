I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  Since I lose money faster, I want to secure a larger portion early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I have to be patient.  It's important to remember the inflation factor, and that I'm losing value much faster than him.  He'll need to budge a bit in the next round to get me to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer Bob a decent cut. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept before the inflation becomes even more detrimental to my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm getting nervous about the inflation. Bob is getting closer to my desired split, and while it's still a loss for me from Round 1, it's better than continuing to risk further losses. I'll take it!"
