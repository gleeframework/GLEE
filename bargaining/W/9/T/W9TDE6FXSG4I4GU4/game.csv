4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be realistic, this is almost an even split considering the money will be worth less very soon!",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. My previous offer is the best you'll get considering the inflation. I've lowered it slightly, but if we wait any longer, we'll both lose out even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this back and forth is pointless. It's clear we both lose with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point.",Bob,4,
