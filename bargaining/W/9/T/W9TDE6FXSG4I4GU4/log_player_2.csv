"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. My previous offer is the best you'll get considering the inflation. I've lowered it slightly, but if we wait any longer, we'll both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
