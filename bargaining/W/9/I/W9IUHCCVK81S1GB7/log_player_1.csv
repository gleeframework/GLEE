Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you.  We can adjust as we go. 
# Alice gain: 45

Do you accept this offer?","{
