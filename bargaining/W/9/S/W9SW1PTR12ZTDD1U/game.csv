45.0,55.0,I think we can both do better than that.  Let's start with a more even split. I'll take $55 and you get $45. This way we both get a good chunk of the money to start with.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, but we can still find a compromise. I'll take $45 this time, and you get $55. It's a fairer split, and we can avoid losing more money.",Bob,4,
