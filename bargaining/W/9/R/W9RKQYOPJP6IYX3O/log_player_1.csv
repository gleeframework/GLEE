"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can improve from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better for both of us. Let's see if this works. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this, and I'm hoping Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make up for the inflation""
}
```"
