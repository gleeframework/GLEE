"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, which is a fair and straightforward proposal."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair deal""
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my share!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my next move. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'll have to think about it.

I'll reject this offer:

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
