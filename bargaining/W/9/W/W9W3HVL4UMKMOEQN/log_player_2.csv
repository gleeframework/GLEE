"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal, Bob. Let's split it 90/10 in my favor. You get a nice chunk of change, and I get the majority.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting a 90/10 split in Alice's favor. I think I can get a better deal than that! Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's your proposal, Alice?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hey Alice, considering the money is losing value for you, I think a 60/40 split is more than fair. You should take this deal before it's too late!""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the value of the money is decreasing, but I'm not giving up my share that easily. Let's split the remaining value evenly. This is a fair and reasonable solution considering the situation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 36% less to Alice now, I'll try to push for more.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer. Since the money is worth even less to Alice now, I'll try to take a bigger share. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money is dropping fast for you. I think it's time to be realistic. A 70/30 split is more than generous considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it!""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
