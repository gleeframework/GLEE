"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. This is a fair starting offer, considering the high stakes of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the offer from Bob is actually equivalent to:

Alice gain: 400,000 (500,000 x 0.8)
Bob gain: 400,000

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise.
