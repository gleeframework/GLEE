"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm giving Bob a small amount to get us started, and I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposals.

I reject Bob's offer. My message is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too little for me, I'm willing to wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less again, so I need to be even more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need to get a good share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still want to be fair. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 14.26% less, which is a significant decrease. I need to be very careful with my next move.

Considering the offer, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially since I'm getting desperate. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle. It's a fair deal.""
}
```"
