"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a very simple offer -  I want 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  This way, even if Bob declines, I'll be able to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and my reduced bargaining power. I'm going to reject this offer and hope that Bob will come to his senses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my demand slightly, but I'm still aiming for a large share of the money.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident I can secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be greedy, even though the inflation is hurting him much more than me. I will continue to reject his offers until he realizes that we both need to find a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still aiming for a majority.  It's clear Bob is going to be difficult, so I need to show I'm willing to compromise while still securing a decent outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more desperate, but his offers are still way too lopsided.  I will continue to reject them and hope that he'll finally come around to a more fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm getting closer to a more even split. Bob's offers are becoming increasingly worse for him due to inflation, so I'm hoping this offer will tempt him into accepting."
