"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I should get a little more given the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation affects you, my share goes up 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The inflation is significant, we need to adjust for it to reach a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on your side, my share increases 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the increasing inflation, accepting an offer of $40 when it's effectively worth even less is a terrible deal for Bob.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Bob needs to hold out for a better offer and hope Alice becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing an even split before inflation eats away at any potential deal for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, my share goes up again 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting bolder, but Bob still has some leverage. While 38 is better than nothing (which is what he'll get in 5 more rounds), it's a significantly devalued 38. Bob needs to hold strong, signal his willingness to walk away, and hope Alice's greed doesn't get the better of her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  I'd rather walk away with nothing than be exploited by your greed.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob needs to play a strong hand. By offering slightly less than a 50/50 split, he's acknowledging the inflation while still aiming for a reasonable deal.  More importantly, the ""final offer"" message creates urgency and signals to Alice that Bob is not afraid to walk away. This might be enough to push her to accept."
