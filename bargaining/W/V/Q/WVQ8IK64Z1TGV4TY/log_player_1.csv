"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the current state of the economy.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm taking a risk by giving you more, but I'm willing to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer because Bob is giving me a smaller share, but still a decent amount. Considering the inflation and the fact that my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll take the 40% and hope that Bob will be satisfied with his 60%."
