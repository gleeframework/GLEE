"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my effective gain in Round 2 would be $54 (60% of $90, which is 90% of the original $100). I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation, but I'll assume it is.

I accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
