I'm starting with a relatively fair split, giving Bob a slightly larger share. I'm hoping to get the game over quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While the offer is better than the previous round, the inflation factor is still significant. I believe I can get a better deal if we continue to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'm proposing an even split this round. Given the inflation, I think this is the most fair and reasonable offer, as we both get an equal share of the dwindling value."
