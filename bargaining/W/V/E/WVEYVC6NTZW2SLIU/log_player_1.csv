"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer is designed to be attractive to Bob, even though I am taking the majority of the money. It gives him a small amount, but it's better than nothing if he rejects and we go to the next round where the money is worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
