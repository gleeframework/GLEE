Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and split the money more evenly, but I'm still taking into account the inflation. Let's reach a deal before the money becomes even less valuable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. While she's feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly, waiting her out will yield a better deal for me in the long run."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation we both face. Let's close this deal.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. This offer is a fair compromise given the inflation, and it ensures we both get something. Let's reach an agreement before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer is finally in a reasonable range, and time is becoming a serious factor. While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly.  It's better to take this offer and guarantee a win."
