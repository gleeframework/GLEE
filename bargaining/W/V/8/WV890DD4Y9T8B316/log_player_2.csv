"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 10% and keeping 90% for myself.  You can accept or we can keep playing, but remember, each round lessens the value of the money! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
Let's see if Alice is willing to be more generous in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Time is running out and the value is decreasing!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not giving up a majority share.  Let's split it 70/30. This is my final offer before the money keeps losing value! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is negotiating, a 70/30 split is still heavily in her favor.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a larger share, even with the inflation pressure. Let's see if she's bluffing about this being her final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right about the shrinking pot.  My final offer is a 55/45 split.  Let's end this before we both lose out!""}"
