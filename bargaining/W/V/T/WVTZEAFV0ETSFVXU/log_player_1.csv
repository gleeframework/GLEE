Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Bob's message: I think it's more fair for me to take a slightly larger share, since I'm taking on the risk of you rejecting my offer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...
