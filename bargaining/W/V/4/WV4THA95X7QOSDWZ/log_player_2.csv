Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both feeling the pressure.  Let's just split it evenly and get something from this deal. 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting longer means a significantly smaller payout for both, even if Bob manages to get a slightly larger share. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The potential gain from holding out for a slightly better offer is outweighed by the substantial loss in value with each passing round.
* **Risk of Getting Zero:** If Bob continues to reject offers and doesn't secure a deal, both he and Alice will walk away with nothing. 

While Bob started with a goal of getting a larger share, the time pressure and aggressive inflation rate make accepting a 50/50 split the most rational decision at this stage.
