"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money, while still giving Bob something. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that benefits me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation means that Bob is getting less with each passing round.  This is a fair split considering the circumstances."
