"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the money is losing value, Alice is not offering a fair deal. It's better to hold out and hope for a better offer in the next round.  I'm aiming for a larger share, knowing that Alice doesn't experience inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is steadily decreasing for me. While I'd like a larger share, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out. This offer is slightly better than what Alice proposed in Round 3 and gives me a slight advantage. If she rejects it, I'm likely facing diminishing returns in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money has significantly decreased for me. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better than her previous offer and significantly better than risking another round where the value for me will plummet even further. It's clear she's not budging much, and I need to cut my losses."
