"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you'll take 20%. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 20% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's start from here and see where we can go. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is more fair, considering I'm already taking a hit from inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly lower share. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining money, leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money."
