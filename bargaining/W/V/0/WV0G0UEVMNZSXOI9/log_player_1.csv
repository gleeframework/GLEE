"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this first offer, as the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to offer me a significantly worse deal than the first round. I'll reject this offer and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer Bob a deal that's slightly better than the first round, but still favors me.  I think the inflation is starting to hurt Bob, and he might be willing to accept something closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but his offers are getting progressively worse for him. I'm not going to accept this offer, and I'm hoping that he'll realize his strategy isn't working."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly again.  The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob, and I think he might be willing to accept a deal that's closer to my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 33 
# Bob gain: 67 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and it seems like he's not understanding the impact of inflation on him. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he realizes he's losing more money with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a deal that's slightly better than my last offer, but I'm still holding out for a bigger share. With each round, the inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I believe he'll eventually have to concede to a deal closer to my initial proposal."
