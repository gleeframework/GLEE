"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'm willing to give you 10% of the money. We can work something out in the next rounds if you think this is too low. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds somewhat reasonable, I'm not desperate yet. The potential loss from inflation means it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in later rounds, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm feeling generous, so how about a 60/40 split in my favor?""
}
``` 

This offer is a power move designed to test Alice's greed and willingness to negotiate. By starting high, I establish a position of strength and signal that I'm not afraid to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value of the money is decreasing. We need to reach an agreement soon.  This 60/40 split is fairer than your last offer, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still unacceptable.  While the shrinking pot is a concern, settling for less than half now puts me at a massive disadvantage. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a strong offer, and a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""
}
```

This offer aims to strike a balance between firmness and compromise. By slightly reducing my initial demand, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome. Highlighting the time pressure reinforces the need for Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
