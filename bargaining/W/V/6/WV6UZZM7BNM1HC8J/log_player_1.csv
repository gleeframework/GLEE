"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in your favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, and since the money depreciates faster for you, it's more beneficial for us both to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 600,000:400,000 split.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low considering the inflation rate. I'm hoping for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  Given the significant inflation, it seems like the fairest and most logical solution at this point. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us."
