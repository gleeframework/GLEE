I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob will probably reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
