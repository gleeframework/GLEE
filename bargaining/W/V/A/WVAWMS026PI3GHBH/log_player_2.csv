Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. 60/40 split is fair, considering the time pressure. Let's end this.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. 50/50 is the fairest split at this point.  We both lose more with every round. Agree, and let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of losing a significant chunk of the potential gain.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair. While Bob was aiming for a larger share initially, Alice's offer acknowledges the time pressure and the impact of inflation on both sides.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer puts Bob at a significant risk.  If a deal isn't reached in the remaining rounds, both players get nothing. Accepting guarantees Bob a substantial sum."
