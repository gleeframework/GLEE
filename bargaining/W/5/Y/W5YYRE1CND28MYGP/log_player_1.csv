"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual amounts would be:

# Alice gain: 47.5
# Bob gain: 47.5

I think this is a fair split, and it's getting closer to the deadline. I'll accept Bob's offer.
