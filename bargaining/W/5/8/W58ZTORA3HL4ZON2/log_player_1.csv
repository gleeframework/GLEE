Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's close this out now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most rational decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob, making him more likely to offer a larger share to me as time goes on. However, this also means each round I wait, the less valuable his offer becomes in real terms.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal in Round 5. He might become even more stubborn, and the value of his offer will further decrease. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting a $40/$60 split now guarantees me a reasonable share, even if it's not the optimal outcome I hoped for in earlier rounds.  

It's a tough call, but in negotiation, knowing when to cut your losses and secure a decent outcome is important."
