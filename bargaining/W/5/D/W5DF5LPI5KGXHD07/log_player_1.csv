"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a bit more greedy this round. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's greedy proposal, but I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the new proposal, I'll gain $4,000 and Bob will gain $6,000. It's still a bit lopsided, but I'll have to weigh the risks of going to the next round.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise, Bob! I'll give you a bit more, but not too much""}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,200 and Bob receives $4,800."
