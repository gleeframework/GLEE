"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to accept an even split, but we have 12 rounds and inflation to consider. By rejecting, Bob has the opportunity to propose a split more favorable to him in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling a bit more greedy this round. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a compromise, Bob! I'll give you a bit more, but not too much 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though I'm losing more due to inflation, Alice is offering a slight increase in my share.  It's worth taking this compromise to avoid further potential losses."
