"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also the one who gets to keep most of the money this round!  Let's see if you want to share the wealth more equally. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if Alice gets more generous in the next round given her money depreciates much faster than mine."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. But this is my final offer. If you reject it, I'm taking the whole thing next round! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Our money is losing value quickly. Holding out for a better deal in Round 4 risks getting even less if Alice is true to her word. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message suggests she's becoming more assertive. Rejecting this offer could mean getting zero in the next round.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees us $400,000. Rejecting gambles on a better outcome, but with a very real possibility of ending up with nothing. 

It's better to take a decent share now than risk losing it all by being too greedy."
