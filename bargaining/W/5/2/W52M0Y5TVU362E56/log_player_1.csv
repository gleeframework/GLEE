"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'm looking for a higher share. However, Bob's offer is still a significant compromise from his initial 50-50 proposal. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55% is the maximum I'm willing to give. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With my gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be even more aggressive in my negotiation. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too close to his previous offer, and I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is losing value rapidly. I need to think strategically and make a bold move. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk here, but I think I deserve a bigger share given the inflation. This is my best and final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses even more value. This is my most aggressive offer yet, and I'm willing to take the risk of Bob rejecting it."
