"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and the game can begin!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than equal split, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are:

* My gain of 300,000 is worth 95% of 300,000, which is 285,000
* Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 90% of 700,000, which is 630,000

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 1 was 600,000, but it's worth 95% of that now, which is 570,000. I'll try to make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I'll take 55% and leave you with 45%""
