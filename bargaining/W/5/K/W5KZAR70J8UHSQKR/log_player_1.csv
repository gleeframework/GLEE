"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 95-5 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's work together. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $40,000. Bob's gain of $950,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $950,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think I have to consider the fact that Bob is trying to work together and the offer is still quite generous to me, given the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
