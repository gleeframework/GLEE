"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still give you a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a bigger share, especially since I'm the one making the proposal in the first round. I think I can do better than splitting it evenly. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, I'll get a decent majority, and you'll still get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer again. I was hoping to get a bit more considering the inflation, and I think I can still do better. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share considering the effort I'm putting in to negotiate. This way, I'll get a comfortable majority, and you'll still get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,500, and Bob gets the remaining 35%, which is $3,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's try to be reasonable and split it closer to 50/50. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid losing more. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get concerned about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer is a reasonable one, and I think it's better to accept it rather than risking losing even more value in the next round. Splitting it 55/45 in favor of me is a decent compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses."
