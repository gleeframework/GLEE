"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, as it gives us both a more even share. Let's settle this now and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
