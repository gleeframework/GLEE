"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the initial offer was too skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think the split is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation rate. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was rejected."
