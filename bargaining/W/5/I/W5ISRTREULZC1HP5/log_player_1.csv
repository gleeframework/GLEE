"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a strong opening 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer, but I guess Bob is trying to make a strong opening. Considering the inflation, my $4,000 gain is actually worth 90% of the original $4,000, which is $3,600.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous offer of $8,000 is now worth 81% of the original amount, which is $6,480. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive, but still trying to be reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, which is a 45% share for Bob and 55% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were close, now it's my turn to get closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my previous offer of $5,500 is now worth 72.9% of the original amount, which is $3,918.20.

Considering Bob's new offer, my $4,500 gain is actually worth 45% of the original $10,000, which is $4,500. This is exactly the same amount I offered in the previous round, but now Bob is offering me the same amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and we're getting closer to the middle.
