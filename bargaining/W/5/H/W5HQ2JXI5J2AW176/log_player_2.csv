"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Bob is offered $4000 while Alice gets $6000. Considering the inflation rates, if Bob waits, the money's value decreases more significantly for him than for Alice. However, a 60/40 split might not be the best Bob can get, especially since the penalty for waiting (inflation) impacts him more. He might be able to negotiate a better split in subsequent rounds, making the immediate acceptance of a 60/40 split less favorable. Therefore, Bob decides to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable. The faster we agree, the less we both lose to inflation.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that Bob is more heavily penalized by inflation (20% decrease per round) compared to Alice (5% decrease per round), it is in his interest to conclude the negotiation as soon as possible. However, he also wants to maximize his gain. By proposing a 55/45 split, Bob is making a counteroffer that is more favorable to him than Alice's initial proposal but still acknowledges the need for a compromise to prevent further loss of value. This approach also tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and might prompt her to reconsider her initial stance, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for Bob in subsequent rounds if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 50/50 to avoid further losses due to inflation. It's the fairest solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: At this point, Bob has already seen a significant reduction in the value of the money he could gain due to inflation (36% less). Given that Alice has now offered a 50/50 split, which is a more favorable offer than her initial 60/40 proposal, it seems prudent for Bob to accept this deal. The impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains is substantial, and there's a risk that further rounds could lead to diminishing returns. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures Bob gets a guaranteed amount now, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds, especially considering Alice's compromise indicates she is also motivated to conclude the negotiation."
