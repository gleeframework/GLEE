"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit lopsided.  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money - my share decreases faster than yours with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
