I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round! Let's see what Bob does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still a bad deal for me. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and make a slightly more reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob accepts this time.  I'm hoping to get a better deal since he's going to lose more money than me in this round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  I'm willing to wait one more round and see if I can get a better deal.  He's losing a lot of money to inflation now, so I think I can push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly better deal for Bob, hoping that the inflation will make it more appealing. I'm still trying to get the majority, but I think this might be the best I can do considering the current situation."
