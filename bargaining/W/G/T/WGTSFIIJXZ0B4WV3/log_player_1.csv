"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a split that gives me $9000 and Bob $1000. This seems like a fair starting point given the potential inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Inflation means my share will keep shrinking with each round, and there's no guarantee Bob will make a better offer in the future. It's better to secure half the money now."
