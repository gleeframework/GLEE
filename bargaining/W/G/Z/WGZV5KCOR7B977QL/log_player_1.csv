"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion of the money.  I want to see if he's willing to take a smaller amount now, knowing that his share will decrease more quickly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a better deal for me than the previous round, I believe I can still get a larger share if I play strategically. Bob's offer is still very generous, and it suggests he's willing to negotiate. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly from the last round. This is still a generous offer considering the inflation, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm confident that I can secure a larger portion of the money if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While inflation has been hitting Bob harder, we're both now facing a significant loss of value with each passing round. This offer is a fair split, considering the current inflation rates and the risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other. It's time to secure what we can."
