Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to grab the majority of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer than risk the inflation.  My gains are already significantly reduced from round 1, and it's likely that Bob will offer me even less in the future rounds."
