"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly.  This ensures a good starting point while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is not happy with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable amount of money. Given the inflation factor, it's better to secure 8000 now than risk getting nothing later."
