"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere.  I need a bit more than that to make it worthwhile.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing rapidly, I still hold the power to propose in the next round. Holding out a little longer might make Alice nervous enough to offer a slightly better deal. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out! A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

By round 6, the pressure is on.  While I'd ideally want more, offering a 50/50 split sends a strong signal:

* **Urgency:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value is plummeting for me.
* **Fairness:** It's hard to argue with an even split, especially as Alice has been consistently aiming for more.
* **Simplicity:**  This ends negotiations and guarantees *some* reward.

It's a gamble, as Alice might still hold out for a slightly better deal. However, the rapidly decreasing value makes each round riskier."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your money is melting, take it while you can 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It pains me to accept this, but the situation has turned dire. Here's why:

* **Dwindling Value:** My potential gain is down over 73%! Waiting another round means losing even more. 
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Her offers have been consistent, and she knows time is on her side. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  Holding out for a marginally better offer carries the huge risk of getting zero if we don't reach an agreement. 

This is a classic example of the power dynamic in negotiations shifting as a deadline approaches."
