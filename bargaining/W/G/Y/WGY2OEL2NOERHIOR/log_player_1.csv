"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leave Bob with $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my offer from round 1 would be worth $48 (60% of $80) and Bob's offer would be worth $56 (60% of $93.33). Since Bob's offer is now better than mine, I'll accept it.
