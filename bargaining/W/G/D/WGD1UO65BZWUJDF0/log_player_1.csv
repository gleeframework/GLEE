"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share this time""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small increase, but I'm still not convinced I should give up too much 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be even more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think I deserve a bit more this time""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
