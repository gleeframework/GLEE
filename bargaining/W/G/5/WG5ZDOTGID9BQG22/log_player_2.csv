"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.  We can adjust if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReasoning: In this game, since the money loses value over time due to inflation, it's beneficial to end the game as early as possible to maximize the real value of the money received. However, accepting a 40% share right off the bat might not be the most advantageous, considering the game's structure and the potential for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer that could potentially increase Bob's share or demonstrate willingness to negotiate, possibly leading to a more favorable division in subsequent rounds. Given the asymmetrical impact of inflation (10% decrease for Bob vs. 5% for Alice), there's an incentive for Bob to try to reach a more favorable agreement quickly. \n###"
