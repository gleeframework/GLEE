"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. It accounts for the uneven depreciation of value and still offers a substantial share to both parties. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
