I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself. I figure it's a good starting point and I'm hoping Bob won't be too greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept that! Bob's being way too greedy. I'll let him make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to propose a more even split this time.  I'm still keeping a majority, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with that split.  I'll let him make another offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm going to try a slightly more even split again. I think this is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will start seeing that we need to come to a more equitable agreement."
