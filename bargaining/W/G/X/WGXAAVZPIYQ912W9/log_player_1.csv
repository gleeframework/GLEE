Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both need to take the decreasing value of the money into account. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 45/55 is the best split, considering the decreasing value of the money. I think I can do better.
