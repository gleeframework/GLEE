"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,600 in the second round, due to the 5% inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

I'll reject the offer from Bob for Round 2.
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% total inflation (5% in Round 1 and 5% in Round 2), my target gain should be higher than in the previous round to account for the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
