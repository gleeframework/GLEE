"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that you, Alice, receive $900,000, and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation to favor Bob in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a more even split this time, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. This takes into account the inflation, but also aims to show I am willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. While his offer is higher than in Round 2, the decrease in the value of my share is significant. I'm going to continue negotiating for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this time.  The inflation has been significant, and I think a fair split is the best way to move forward. This shows a willingness to compromise and avoids further risk of losing value from more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than in the previous round, the inflation has dramatically reduced the value of my share. I still believe a more even split is achievable, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I propose a slightly more even split this time, with me receiving $450,000 and Bob receiving $550,000. While the inflation has been significant, I'm still hoping to secure a reasonable share of the money.  This offer is a compromise, but it reflects my willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair due to the rapid inflation.  Even though his offer is higher than in the previous round, the value of my share is now drastically reduced.  I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split. While the inflation has been extremely harsh, I'm willing to compromise to secure a reasonable share of the money. This offer demonstrates my willingness to work towards an agreement and avoids further risk of losing value from more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, and this offer is simply not acceptable.  I will continue negotiating, even with the risk of getting nothing at the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split.  The inflation has made it impossible to get a truly fair split, but I'm still trying to secure a reasonable amount of the money.  This is my final attempt to reach an agreement before we both risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Despite the extreme inflation and the incredibly unfair split, I have no choice but to accept this offer. It's the only way to secure any amount of money. The risk of getting nothing at all is too high at this point."
