Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses.  The value of the money is decreasing too rapidly for me. Accepting a 43/57 split is much better than risking even less in future rounds."
