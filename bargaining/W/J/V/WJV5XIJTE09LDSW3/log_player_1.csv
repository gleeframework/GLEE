  ""bob_gain"": 2000,

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 80%, I'll offer 70% to you this time. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You offered 70%, I'll counter with 60% for me. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 60%, I'll offer 55% to you this time, trying to be more aggressive. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in the money's value, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer of 55% is still a decent split, and it's getting closer to my target. I'll accept this offer.
