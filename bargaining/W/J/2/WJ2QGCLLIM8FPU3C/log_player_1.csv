"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, 5500, and 4500 to Bob, with a message ""Let's be fair"". This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but also want to get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. The message is friendly and inviting, to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a bit more to agree. This is a slight improvement for me while still keeping things fairly balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's trying to make it seem like a fair improvement for both of us, the fact is that I was initially offered 5500 and now I'm being offered 4750, which is significantly less. Considering the 5% inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal to try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground. I've decreased my initial offer by 300, and I'm now proposing 5200 for myself and 4800 for Bob. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" suggests that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, considering that the money is worth less with each passing round."
