"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both lose value over time. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I would get $4,500, which is worth 45% of the original $10,000.
* Bob would get $5,500, which is worth 55% of the original $10,000.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
