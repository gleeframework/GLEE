Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer. I'll give myself a smaller share to see if Alice will accept. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a toll! Okay, I'll consider Alice's new offer. Since I'm not sure how much Alice's offer is affected by inflation, I'll assume it's a good deal and accept it.
