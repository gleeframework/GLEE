"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, and 10% less for Alice, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. With 11 rounds remaining, I have some leverage to try to get a more favorable split. Additionally, Alice's initial offer of 40% for me and 60% for her may not be the most fair considering the difference in inflation rates. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
