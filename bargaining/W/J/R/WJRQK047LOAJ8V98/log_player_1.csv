"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my share while still being reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too generous to Bob. I'll hold out for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not accepting the middle ground, hoping Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to keep a larger share, but not be too greedy.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than in the previous round, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! With the money being worth significantly less, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slight shift in favor of Bob, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, you win this round. But I'm not happy about it!""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I can regroup and come back stronger in future negotiations."
