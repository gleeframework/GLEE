"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer isn't ideal. While getting something is better than nothing, I can try to negotiate for a better share in the next round. The impact of inflation isn't too severe yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but that offer was too low for me. How about this?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is barely budging, and the inflation is starting to hurt. I need to push for a more significant change in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse with every round. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as it's still not an ideal split. However, Alice is unlikely to move much further, and the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, which is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
