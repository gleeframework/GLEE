"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share,  I'm willing to accept this offer. The inflation rate means the money is becoming less valuable with each round."
