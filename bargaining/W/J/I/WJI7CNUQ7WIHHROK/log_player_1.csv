"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly to start, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
