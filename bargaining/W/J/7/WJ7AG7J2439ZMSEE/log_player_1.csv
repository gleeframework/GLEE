"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since we have 12 rounds, and the money depreciates with each round, it's important to secure a large portion early on. This ensures a good payout for me even with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split ensures that I receive a significant portion of the money. Considering the inflation, my share would be worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is still a good outcome.  Further negotiation might lead to a better deal, but the risk of getting nothing due to the limited rounds is too high."
