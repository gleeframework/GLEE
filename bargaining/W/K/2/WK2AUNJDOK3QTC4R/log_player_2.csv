"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take $1,000, and let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to take a chance to see if I can get more!  There are still a lot of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 95/5, that's a fair deal for both of us.  I'm sure we can work something out that benefits us both!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but let's be realistic. I'm not going to give you the lion's share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer.  While I'd like more, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round.  I'm happy with 100,000."
