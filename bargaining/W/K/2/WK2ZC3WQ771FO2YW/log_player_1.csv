"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think 40 is a bit too low for me, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation and my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant inflation factor, I think 45 is a relatively good offer. However, I'm still not convinced that I should give up that much to Bob.

I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll make another offer. Given the significant inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway and split it 50/50, considering the inflation and our previous negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the significant inflation factor. I think it's a fair offer, and it's better than going into further negotiations.
