"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% of the money. We can adjust this in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While 40% isn't a terrible starting point, Alice's money is devaluing much faster than mine. I'm willing to gamble that she'll get more desperate in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming a bit higher. How about we switch it around for this round?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both know inflation is working against us, so let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but I can push my luck a little further. An even split isn't terrible, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer - let's wrap this up and both get something!""
