Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair solution, but your offers don't account for the real losses I face with each passing round. This is my final offer that even comes close to fair for me.   
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. While I'm not losing value, Bob is incentivized to settle quickly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might force Bob to offer even less favorable splits to compensate for the inflation, making the potential future gains less appealing.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonably fair share, whereas continued negotiation carries the risk of ending up with a worse deal or nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
