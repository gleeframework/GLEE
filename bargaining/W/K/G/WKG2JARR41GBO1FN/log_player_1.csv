"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split, with me getting the larger share. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Let me know how he responds!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair Alice, but inflation is hitting you harder than me. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although inflation is affecting me more, I believe his proposed 30-70 split is too skewed in his favor. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a more reasonable division. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, I'm revising my offer to a 52-48 split. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that we meet in the middle, hoping to find a mutually acceptable division. Let's see how he responds!"
