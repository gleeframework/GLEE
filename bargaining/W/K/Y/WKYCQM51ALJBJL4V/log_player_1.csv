  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again! Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money.

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting tough with the inflation! With the money being worth significantly less, I need to be careful.

Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it. It's not ideal, but it's a fair split considering the reduced value of money.
