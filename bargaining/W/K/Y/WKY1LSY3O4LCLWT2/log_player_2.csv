Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems heavily skewed in Alice's favor, especially with the inflation difference working against me more. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a small concession. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's concession is minimal, and the inflation is hurting me more each round.  I need to push for a more significant change in my favor."
