"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll gain in this round.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is 5% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's offer is an even split, which means he'll get $5,000, but that's 10% less than the $5,600 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll consider this a decent compromise, considering the inflation.
