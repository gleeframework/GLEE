Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. This offer is closer to what you proposed, but still gives me a decent share. We can avoid losing more money to inflation if we agree. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
user: Congratulations! You have agreed to split the money and finish the game.
Alice will get $6,000
You will get $4,000, which is worth $2,560 due to inflation.
