"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't want to give up too much, so I'll reject this offer. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, where I get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to be more cautious. I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going into negative territory. I'll accept this offer, as it's still a decent compromise.
