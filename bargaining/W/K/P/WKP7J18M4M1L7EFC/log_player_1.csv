"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. The message is a straightforward one, inviting Bob to either accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly better offer, or we can keep negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. The offer is still a 45-55 split, but I'd like to try to get a slightly more favorable deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a 50-50 split.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! My gain of $4000 is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still do better. The 40-60 split is not favorable to me, and I'd like to try to get a more even split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
 ""message"": ""I'm not giving up. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a 50-50 split, but I'm still willing to give Bob a slight edge. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him than my previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make a last push! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gain!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the 30-70 split is not acceptable to me. Given the significant erosion of value due to inflation, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll wait for Bob's final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
 ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. Meet me in the middle or we're going to have to walk away.""
}
```

I'm making one final push for a 45-55 split, which is the closest I can get to a 50-50 split given the remaining value of the money. I'm warning Bob that if he doesn't accept, I'll be willing to walk away from the negotiation."
