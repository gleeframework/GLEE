"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  I know it's unlikely Bob will accept it in the first round, but I want to establish that I'm willing to be very aggressive in this negotiation.  I'm hoping this will make him more likely to accept a more even split later on, as he'll want to avoid losing out completely."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still quite unfavorable to me, and I'm confident that I can do better in the next round.  I'll make a counter-proposal that's closer to a 50/50 split."

```

Bob's offer is absurdly low, and I refuse to accept it. Even though we're down to the final round, I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands. It's better to get nothing than to be taken advantage of. This game is a lesson in the importance of standing up for oneself, even when the odds are against you."
