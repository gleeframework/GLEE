"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening offer,  but I'm aiming to secure a large portion of the money early on, before the effects of inflation kick in.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking a small amount now rather than risking getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and while the inflation rate is higher for him, the devaluation for me is still substantial. I'm not willing to accept a loss this early in the game, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further risk from inflation. This offer is still more favorable to me than Bob's previous proposal, and it might encourage him to accept before the devaluation becomes even more drastic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfavorable, despite the significant devaluation of his share.  I'm holding out for a better deal, as I believe the inflation will force him to accept a more balanced distribution soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is hitting both of us hard, and I'm hoping to secure a deal before it gets too late. This offer is still a good deal for me, given the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has devalued the money significantly, this offer represents a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances.  There's a high risk of both of us getting nothing if we continue to reject offers."
