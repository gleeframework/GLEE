"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, as I'm taking the majority of the money, but it's still fair, given that I'm taking the first turn. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's true that inflation has affected my potential earnings, a 10/90 split is simply unacceptable. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is too lopsided. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm willing to give Bob a more substantial share this time, but I still need to secure a majority as the inflation has significantly impacted my earnings.  Hopefully, this offer is reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
