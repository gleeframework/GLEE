Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with you getting the larger share. I'm trying to be fair, but we need to close this deal soon before the inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, time is on my side. The inflation is hitting her harder, and she'll become more desperate for a deal as time goes on. I'm aiming for at least a 50/50 split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced deal.  However,  let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that the inflation is impacting you more than me.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split this evenly.  The inflation is hurting both of us, and we're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally willing to split the money evenly. While I might have been able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in a later round, the risk of walking away with nothing after round 12 is too high. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a decent gain."
