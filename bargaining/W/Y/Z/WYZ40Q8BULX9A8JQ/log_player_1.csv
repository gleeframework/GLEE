Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 95% of its original value, so I'll aim for a more balanced split.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}"
