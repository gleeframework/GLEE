Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to compromise, but taking 95 for yourself is too much. I'll take 60, and you can have 40. It's a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
