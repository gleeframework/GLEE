"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the money is now worth less. Let's end this and get our share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is still the most sensible. Take it now before it's worth even less for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still slightly unfavorable, the declining value of the money makes it increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  It's better to accept the offer and secure a somewhat smaller gain than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
