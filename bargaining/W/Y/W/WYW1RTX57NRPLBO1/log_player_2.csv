Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you more than I got in Round 1, and it's only going to shrink with more rounds. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
