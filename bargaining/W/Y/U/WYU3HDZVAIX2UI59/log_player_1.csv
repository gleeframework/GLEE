Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair,  I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we both get a good chunk of the money.  Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer is better than what I would get if we continue to the next round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal for myself.  I'll take the risk of another round."
