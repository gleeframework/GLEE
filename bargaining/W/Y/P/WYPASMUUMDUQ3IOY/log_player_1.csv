"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, which I believe is a generous and fair offer considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in this proposal and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The difference in inflation rates between us means that the longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses in comparison to me, which gives me some leverage to push for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for both of us.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still aiming to maximize my own gain. The message is designed to appeal to Bob's understanding of the inflationary pressure on both of us, suggesting that accepting this offer would be prudent for both parties."
