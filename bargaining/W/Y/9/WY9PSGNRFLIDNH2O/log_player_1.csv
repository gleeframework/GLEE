Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this quickly and both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 630,000
* Bob gain: 630,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
