"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I get a decent amount of money upfront, while still leaving Bob with a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting me more, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine in the first round, but still not as generous as I would like. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting me, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to hurt me now. Considering the value of the money I'll get is decreasing rapidly, I'll take Bob's offer this time. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing in the end.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
