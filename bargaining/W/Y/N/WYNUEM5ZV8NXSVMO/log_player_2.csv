Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but I'm giving you a little something to start with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money closer to the middle, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation affecting me more. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her harder, but I need to leverage that, not simply accept a less imbalanced deal.  There's a lot of rounds left to negotiate."

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my share a bit more, but I still need a majority to offset the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving towards a more balanced split, but it's still not good enough.  While she's losing value faster, accepting 40% when we're almost halfway through is not in my best interest. I need to push for a more equitable split while the rounds give me leverage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal. It accounts for the inflation difference while giving us both a respectable amount. Let's end this now and both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly from my previous offer, but aiming for a more convincing split.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and this offer highlights the mutual benefit of a quick resolution.  It's a strong position before we hit the later rounds."
