Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money with every round we waste. Accept this fair offer and let's be done. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and rightfully so. Her share is rapidly losing value.  I'll hold out for a slightly better offer, but I need to be mindful that I might have to accept a less favorable deal soon if she doesn't budge much."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a slight improvement for you. Let's end this now before we both lose out more.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a better deal than you've offered so far.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting desperate, and her offers aren't likely to get better for me. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer now guarantees I get something, and it's still a better deal than her initial offer. Waiting any longer is too risky, as she might drastically reduce her offer or give up entirely."
