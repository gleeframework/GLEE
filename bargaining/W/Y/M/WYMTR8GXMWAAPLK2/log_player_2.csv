**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing significantly due to inflation, accepting Alice's offer at this point would mean settling for less than half of the original amount.  It's a risky move, but I'm betting Alice will feel the pressure and offer a larger sum in the next couple of rounds to avoid us both losing out."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this offer is less than I wanted, rejecting it risks a worse outcome in future rounds.  It's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing."
