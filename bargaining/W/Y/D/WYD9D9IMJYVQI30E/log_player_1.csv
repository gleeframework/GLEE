"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the uneven split, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to balance the split, but still favoring myself slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money being worth 27.1% less, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think the 52-48 split is reasonable, and I'd rather accept this offer than risk going into further rounds and losing more value due to inflation."
