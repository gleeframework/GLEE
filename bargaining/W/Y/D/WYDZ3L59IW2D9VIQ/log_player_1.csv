Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to keep things friendly.""

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively small share of the money to start, while keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split is fair 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share, considering the initial amount.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the effort I put in 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less now.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less now. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.
