Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing on the fact that the money is losing value for me.  However, accepting a deal where I get significantly less means I'm letting her win by exploiting the system. I need to hold out a bit longer.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take what you can get 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Alice is really turning the screws. I need to decide if holding out for a slightly better deal is worth the risk of getting nothing. 

Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** 40 for me (worth even less due to inflation), 60 for Alice.
* **Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  5 rounds left.

Alice is betting I'll crack. Accepting now is the ""safe"" choice, but it feels like giving in to her tactic. I need to take a stand, but with a slight concession. 

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** I'm running out of time, and Alice knows it.
* **Concession:**  I've increased my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but not be walked all over. 
* **Finality:** The ""take it or leave it"" shows I'm serious. It forces Alice to make a choice:  settle for slightly less than she wants, or risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","This is excruciating! Alice is ruthless and knows she's got me over a barrel. Accepting means a terrible deal, but rejecting could mean nothing at all. 

Here's the cold, hard reality:

* **Time:**  Only 3 rounds left. Inflation is eating my potential gains every second.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She's been consistent.  She'll likely keep pushing me lower, hoping I panic.
* **My Leverage:** I have almost none left, except the slim chance that Alice might prefer a small win now over risking everything.

I have to take the hit.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the alternative is most likely worse.
