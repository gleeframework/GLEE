"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
