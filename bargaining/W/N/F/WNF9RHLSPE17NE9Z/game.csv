300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation working against us.",Bob,2,

900000.0,100000.0,"Bob,  I'm still willing to be generous, but your last offer was too low. Let's split this 90/10, and both of us will walk away with something substantial.",Alice,3,
