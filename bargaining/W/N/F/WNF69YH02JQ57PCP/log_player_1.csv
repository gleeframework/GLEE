"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it reflects a slight advantage for the proposer in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since inflation has taken effect, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise considering both the previous rounds and the impact of inflation. I'm confident that this offer will be accepted, as Bob knows that further rounds will only reduce the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unacceptable.  While the inflation has eroded the value of the money, his offer gives me a significantly smaller share compared to the initial rounds. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's necessary to avoid further inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's unlikely that he can secure a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply too low. While the inflation has eroded the value of the money considerably, I cannot accept such a disproportionate split. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

I'm offering a 35/65 split in Bob's favor.  The inflation is significant at this point, and I need to make a compromise to secure a deal. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each passing round."
