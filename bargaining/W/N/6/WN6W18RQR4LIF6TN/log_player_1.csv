"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the initial $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's end the game with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 55% of the remaining money, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and end the game with a 50/50 split.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
