"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, with a message that suggests fairness in the division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but inflation is hitting you hard.  Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his seemingly considerate message, the division he's proposing is significantly skewed in his favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential gain. I'll take my chances in the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the impact of inflation on both our gains. Given that the money I gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round (20% decrease from round 1 to round 2, and another 20% decrease from round 2 to round 3), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less (5% decrease from round 1 to round 2, and another 5% decrease from round 2 to round 3), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

### {""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's rebalance""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message that highlights the need to rebalance the division due to the uneven impact of inflation on our gains. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - the money is losing value fast for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain and the fact that this is Bob's final offer, I'll weigh my options carefully. The division he's proposing is still not ideal, but the decreasing value of the money might make it prudent to accept rather than risking further loss in subsequent rounds.

### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer, as the risk of further inflation might leave me with an even less favorable outcome if I were to reject it and proceed to another round."
