"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 600,000$. But the value of Bob's gain is 10% less, so he's getting 630,000$. This is a better deal for me than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. With the inflation effect, his gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so he's getting 291,800$ (650,000 * 0.4549). My gain, on the other hand, is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm getting 600,000$. This offer is actually worse for me than my previous one, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's gain is getting smaller and smaller due to inflation, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

I'm offering you 350,000$ and keeping 650,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Let's analyze Bob's new offer. With the inflation effect, his gain is now worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so he's getting 237,000$ (550,000 * 0.4305). My gain, on the other hand, is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm getting 600,000$. This offer is actually worse for me than my previous one, so I'll reject it.

However, I'm starting to think that Bob might be getting desperate, and his gain is getting smaller and smaller. I'll try to take advantage of that in my next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a bold move. Since Bob's gain is getting significantly smaller due to inflation, I'll try to take a larger share of the remaining money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you 200,000$ and keeping 800,000$ for myself. This is a riskier move, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it since his gain is getting smaller and smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to split the remaining money 50/50. With the inflation effect, his gain is now worth 52.17% less than in the first round, so he's getting 242,000$ (500,000 * 0.4843). My gain, on the other hand, is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm getting 600,000$. This is actually a worse deal for me than my previous offer, but it's a relatively fair split considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
