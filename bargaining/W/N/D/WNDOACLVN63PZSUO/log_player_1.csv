"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me since we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I deserve more than 30% of the total. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think 45 is a good number for me. Your turn to decide.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more than Bob's initial offer."
