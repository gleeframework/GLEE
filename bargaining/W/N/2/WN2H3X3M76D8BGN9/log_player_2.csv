Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a good share while acknowledging the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! I'll make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nMy offer:\n# My message: Alice, your offer is better, but I still think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation difference. \n# Bob gain: 5700\n# Alice gain: 4300\n\nWill Alice accept this offer?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution considering the inflation. Let's end this now before we both lose out more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept the 50/50 split. Given the increasing loss of value due to inflation for both of us, and especially considering Alice's higher rate of loss, this seems like a reasonable and fair conclusion to the game. Continuing further would likely result in both of us losing more value than we would gain from negotiating for a slightly larger share."
