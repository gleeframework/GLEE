"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to respond. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually $240,000.

I don't think this offer is as good as mine, so I'll reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good deal, I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 38-62.""
}
```"

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's actually $102,400.
