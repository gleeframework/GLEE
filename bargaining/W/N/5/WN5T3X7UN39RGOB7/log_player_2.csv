"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more for it to make sense for me to accept. This is my counter-offer."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly for both of us. It's in Bob's best interest to settle this quickly.
* **Alice's Declining Position:**  Alice's offer in Round 1 would net her $6000.  If Bob rejects this offer, in Round 3 her maximum potential gain (assuming she gets 100%) is only $8800 ($10,000 - 10% - another 10%). This means she's losing potential profit with each round.
* **Bob's Stronger Position:** By offering slightly more than half, Bob acknowledges Alice's desire for a larger share while still securing a reasonable amount for himself. 

This offer attempts to be a balance between fairness and the need to settle quickly due to the rapid inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases rapidly for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation is really hurting now. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the value of the money, regardless of who gets what.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice seems firm and this offer is better than what Bob could expect if he rejects and makes his own offer in Round 4.  
* **Better Than Losing More:** If Bob rejects, he risks getting an even smaller share in Round 4, which would be worth significantly less due to inflation. 

It's better to accept a slightly less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting even less later when the money is worth even less."
