"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily impacts me. It's better to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation. I propose a more balanced split that accounts for the decreasing value over time.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I've adjusted the split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is still not accounting for the difference in inflation rates. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still skewed in her favor as she loses value slower than I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5700,
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""We need to find a solution that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both sides. This offer factors in the different rates and aims for a fairer long-term split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this is still not a middle ground considering the difference in inflation. It heavily favors her in the long run, especially as we are already halfway through the rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and both losing money.  This split acknowledges the inflation difference while leaving us both with something substantial.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out, let's meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, as it's still not ideal considering the inflation difference. However, time is running out, and Alice has moved closer to a more balanced offer. Accepting this prevents us from both losing out entirely in the later rounds."
