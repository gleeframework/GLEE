"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since the money is worth less now 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
