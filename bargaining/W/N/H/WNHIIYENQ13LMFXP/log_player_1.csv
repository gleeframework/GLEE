"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. But I'm not convinced. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I believe you, Bob. You're trying to get the better end of the deal. I'll wait for a more sincere offer.""
}
```

I'm not going to fall for Bob's attempt to flip the script. I'll wait for a more genuine offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal. Given the inflation, my gain is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split is more in line with the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
