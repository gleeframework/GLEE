"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40. A fair deal for us both to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a bit greedy. 60/40 is not quite fair enough for me. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice has to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer you 3500 to start. This gives us both a bit more than the last offer, and lets us get closer to a resolution. Let's work together!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I came down from my previous offer. This split ensures we both benefit more than your last proposal and avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like a better split, it's getting risky.  Inflation is hurting, and Alice has shown she's willing to compromise.  It's time to take the deal and secure some money."
