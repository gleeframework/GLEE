"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split,  60% for me and 40% for you. Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept a 40/60 split. There's a lot of time left in the game, and the money is going to be worth less with each passing round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the decreasing value of the money.  Let's move forward and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think it's the fairest way to move forward. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While an even split isn't ideal, the money is losing value rapidly. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome for me."
