"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I would receive $800 (1000 / 0.8) and Bob would receive $9,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.
