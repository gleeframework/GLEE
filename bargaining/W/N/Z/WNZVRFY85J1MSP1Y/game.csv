6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money reasonably. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is more fair. It reflects the fact that I'm taking on the risk of rejecting your offer and potentially getting a worse deal in the next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. We both lose if this drags on. I'm taking a hit from inflation, so how about a 55/45 split?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is affecting you, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the risks we both take in each round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing money with every round, and this offer is the best you're going to get. If we don't agree now, we'll both lose out in the end.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
