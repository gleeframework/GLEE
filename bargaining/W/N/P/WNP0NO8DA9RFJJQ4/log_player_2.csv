"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, Alice is getting significantly more and it's only the first round. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the money depreciates for both of us. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the depreciation 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to accept since the offer is higher than the previous round, Alice is still getting a larger share, and there are still many rounds to go. I'm hoping for an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle this time, but I think this split is fairer. Let's wrap this up!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being reasonable, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to accept, and the inflation is making her offer increasingly less appealing to me. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""We're getting closer! This is my final offer.  We both lose more with each passing round.""}
