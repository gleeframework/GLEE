Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give 10 dollars to Bob.  This way, I can maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will lose value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose to keep 60 dollars for myself and give 40 dollars to Bob. While the money is worth less than in the first round, I believe this offer is more balanced than Bob's previous offer, and it's still a good deal for me considering the inflation rate."
