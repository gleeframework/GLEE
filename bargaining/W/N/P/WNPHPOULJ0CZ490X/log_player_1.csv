"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively fair deal considering the money's value will decrease by 20% for him in each subsequent round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more equitable split, given the inflation we'll both be facing. I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I initially offered Bob $400,000, and now he's offering me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for himself. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for him each round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer, taking into account the fact that the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob each round. Since Bob offered me $450,000 in the previous round, I'm now offering him the same amount, while increasing my own share to $550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable split, given the inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
