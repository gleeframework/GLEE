# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a seemingly ""fair"" split,  I know the money will be worth less in each round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more realistic - I'll take 55% since I'm the one making the offer now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still being greedy. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself in the next round, even if it means taking a bigger risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  I'm willing to split the money 60/40, but I won't go any lower.  If you reject this, we both risk getting nothing at all.""}
