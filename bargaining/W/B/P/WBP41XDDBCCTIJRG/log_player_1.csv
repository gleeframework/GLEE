"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. This is my opening offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my evaluation of the offer accordingly.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: $450,000 (worth 95% of $475,000, which is what it would have been worth in Round 1)
Bob's gain: $550,000 (worth 95% of $577,894, which is what it would have been worth in Round 1)

Considering the adjusted values, I think this offer is a good deal for me. I'll accept it!
