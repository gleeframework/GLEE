"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a 60/40 split this time. It's your turn next, so consider this a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and Bob's offer is actually a 60/40 split in favor of Bob, which is even more skewed towards him than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now, and I'll make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim for a more aggressive split to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a 60/40 split, I'll counter with an 80/20 split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping that he'll accept to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we're both playing a game of chicken here.  Let's compromise.  I'll take 80%, you take 20%.  Next round, it's your turn. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob's offer is a 80/20 split in his favor, which is an even more extreme split than my previous offer. However, considering the reduced value of the money, I think it's worth considering.

I'll accept this offer, as it's still a significant amount of money, even if it's a relatively small share of the original amount.
