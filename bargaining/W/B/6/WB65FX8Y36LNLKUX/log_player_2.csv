"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer is highly favorable to me, but it's still a good chunk of money for you.  It's better to secure something now than risk it all with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. My offer gives you a sizable sum upfront. Consider the impact of inflation on my end. This is a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you, but your last offer was much too low. This is a much fairer split, considering the situation and the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the pressure is increasing, accepting a 30/70 split at this stage would be a significant loss, especially knowing she was willing to take 30% in the previous round. I need to show firmness to secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. You get a larger share than my previous offer, and it safeguards me from significant inflation loss. Time is running out for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you closer to the middle, but this has to be the end. Accept this now, or we're both walking away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but her offer is still unacceptable.  She's using the time pressure tactic, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting now would mean a significant loss due to inflation, and I believe she'll be forced to offer a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split that acknowledges the time pressure and the impact of inflation. Let's end this now and avoid getting nothing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is absolutely my final offer. You're severely underestimating the effect of inflation on your end. Take this deal, or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, the value of my share diminishes significantly. Waiting any longer drastically reduces my potential gain, even if I could secure a slightly better deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests she's unwilling to budge further. Rejecting this offer carries a massive risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Time Pressure:**  Only five rounds remain.  The risk of reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing is too high. 

Taking the 40/60 split, while painful, guarantees a reasonable sum considering the circumstances. It's the safest option to avoid a complete loss."
