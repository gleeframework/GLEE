**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and her potential share diminishes rapidly. While my potential winnings are also decreasing, it's at a much slower rate.  I need to hold out for a better offer."

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  By framing this as her ""last chance,"" I'm hoping she'll see the writing on the wall.  The offer is still in my favor, but the decreasing value of the money makes each round riskier."
