"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob will likely take it as he gets something rather than nothing, and I get the lion's share.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, a 40/60 split is far too unfavorable. I can still make a counteroffer and get a better deal than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still more favorable than Bob's last one. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation,  the 45/55 split is a better deal than I can likely get if I keep rejecting. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
