"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a 4:1 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 1:1, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, I'm not too keen on the 1:1 split. I'd rather aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value of my potential earnings due to inflation.
