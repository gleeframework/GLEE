"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 dollars. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to give Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, and I'll get 80 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, taking 30 dollars for himself. Considering the inflation, the money I'll gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I'll gain is 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 dollars.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to take into account the decreasing value of money. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but it's still a fair offer considering the inflation. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to give Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being stingy, I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is becoming more aggressive in his offers.

Considering the inflation, the money I'll gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means the actual amount I'll gain is 60 * 0.8554 = 51.33 dollars (approx).

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob is getting more assertive, so I'll try to counter with a stronger offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm not being stingy, I'm just trying to protect my share. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a very small share, but I'm trying to convey a sense of finality to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more games 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more conciliatory in his offer.

Considering the inflation, the money I'll gain is now worth 22.62% less than in the first round, which means the actual amount I'll gain is 50 * 0.7718 = 38.59 dollars (approx).

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
