Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it.  Since the money depreciates with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is a big factor. I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting this offer and potentially going through more rounds with further depreciation."
