Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. This is a better deal for you than my last one. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show strength and willingness to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:** 

At this stage, demonstrating resolve is critical.  Alice needs to understand that I'm willing to walk away from increasingly significant sums to achieve a fair deal. A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the inflation working against me, is presented as a non-negotiable offer. This puts the pressure on Alice and might make her reconsider pushing for a larger share in future rounds."
