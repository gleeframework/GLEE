# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than what Bob originally offered me. I need to hold out for a better deal as accepting this sets a very bad precedent for the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation. I need to hold strong, even though the pressure is immense. Accepting this sets a terrible precedent and means I'm getting a worse deal with each round.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is incredibly frustrating. Bob is blatantly exploiting the situation, but I cannot afford to cave in. Accepting this offer would mean losing almost two-thirds of the initial value. I have to show I'm willing to risk it all to get a somewhat fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. We're down to the wire. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.  Any more stalling and we both get NOTHING.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a drastic move. Bob needs to understand the severity of the situation.  Offering a 50/50 split, even with the impact of inflation, shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal but also willing to lose everything if he continues to be unreasonable. This is a high-stakes gamble, but with only two rounds left, it's the strongest signal I can send."
