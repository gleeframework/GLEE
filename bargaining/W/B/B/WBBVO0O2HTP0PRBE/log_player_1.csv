"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is to split the money 40-60, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
