"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is a ""fair"" split, it's not taking into account the inflation factor. In the next round, Alice's offer will be worth significantly less to her, meaning she might be more willing to accept a more balanced split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so a balanced deal is best for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share given the uncertainty of future rounds. This way, I'll take a bit more now and we can reassess later. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise. It acknowledges that I have the power now since I can reject this offer and potentially get a better deal in the next round, but it also recognizes the inflation factor that will affect both of us.  This split is more fair than the initial one and it avoids the risk of further rounds of inflation."
