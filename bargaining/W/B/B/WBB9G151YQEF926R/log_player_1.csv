"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the uncertainty of future rounds.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me receiving 6000 and Bob receiving 4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so a balanced deal is best for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I agree with Bob's proposal. While it's true that we both lose value with each round, I think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share given the uncertainty of future rounds. This way, I'll take a bit more now and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me receiving 5500 and Bob receiving 4500."
