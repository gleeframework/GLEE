"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll keep the same value in mind.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split this time, giving us both $5,000."
