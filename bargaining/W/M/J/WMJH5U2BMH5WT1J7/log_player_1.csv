"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of the money, and now Bob is offering me a smaller share. I'm not sure I want to give him such a large chunk of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, let's meet in the middle?""
}
```"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money! With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'm getting a bit more desperate. However, I still don't want to give Bob too much control over the remaining funds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive this time, considering the rapid devaluation of the money. I'll aim for a bigger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to call my bluff! Considering the rapid inflation, a 50/50 split might not be the worst idea, especially since the money is losing value so quickly. I'll take it.
