"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think 55/45 is a more equitable split given the inflation factor. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
