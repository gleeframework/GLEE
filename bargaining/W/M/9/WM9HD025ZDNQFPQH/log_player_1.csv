"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't be serious with an even split, I'm the one taking the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, I'm not going to let you get away with it!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to compensate for the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're being fair, but I'm the one who's losing out on value with each passing round. Meet me in the middle, or at least closer to it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal considering the inflation."
