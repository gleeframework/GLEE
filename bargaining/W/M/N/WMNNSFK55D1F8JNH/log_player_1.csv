{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair and split the money almost equally.  I propose I take $5,500 and you take $4,500. This way we both benefit from settling quickly and avoid losses due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think it's more fair to split the money closer to 50/50.  I'm willing to take slightly less to make the deal more equitable.  Let's avoid further inflation and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
