"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While a million dollars is a lot to lose, accepting unfair offers sets a bad precedent for the rest of the game. Alice needs to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. This split ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not a fair deal. The impact of inflation on her share is becoming more significant, giving Bob more leverage to push for a better split in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and inflation is working against you.  This is a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally a fair deal! While Bob might have been able to squeeze a bit more out of Alice in earlier rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now ensures he doesn't risk getting nothing if the game goes to the final round."
