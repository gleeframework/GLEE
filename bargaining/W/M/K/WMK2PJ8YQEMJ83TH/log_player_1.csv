"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a small share, but I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this, especially since Bob is taking a relatively large share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer will be a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a fair deal and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the middle, but I still want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, my options are becoming increasingly limited.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 45 is a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to take it and end the game."
