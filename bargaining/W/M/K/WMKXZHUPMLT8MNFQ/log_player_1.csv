Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the massive inflation hit you're taking, I think 80-20 is a reasonable deal. You're still getting something, and I'm taking on the risk of further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, the inflation is heavily affecting Alice's gains. Even though the offer is significantly in Bob's favor, accepting it is the best option for Alice to secure at least some of the money. Further rounds will only result in a smaller share for Alice due to inflation."
