"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective gain I'll get from this offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 40 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original 44 dollars I would have gotten in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.

However, Bob's message suggests that he's being a bit more aggressive, so I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 this time""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced offer compared to the previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 30 dollars, which is worth 73.1% of the original 41.3 dollars I would have gotten in the first round. That's a tough pill to swallow.

However, Bob's message suggests he's being more assertive, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll take a deep breath and accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
