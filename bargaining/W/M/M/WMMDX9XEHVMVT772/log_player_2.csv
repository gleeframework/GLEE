Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the money is worth less for Bob, it's also worth less for Alice. 
* **Alice's Offer:** This offer is significantly better for Bob than the previous round, even with inflation factored in. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means risking a worse outcome in the next round, as Alice may offer a lower share. 

It's important to note that this decision is based on the provided information and the assumption that Alice is acting rationally to maximize her own gains."
