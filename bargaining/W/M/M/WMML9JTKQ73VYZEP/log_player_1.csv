"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a seemingly generous deal to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action given the circumstances.  

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are declining significantly with each round. 
* **Bob's Strategy:**  Bob clearly wants a much larger share, and his offer demonstrates a willingness to push for it.  
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means I risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. 

It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
