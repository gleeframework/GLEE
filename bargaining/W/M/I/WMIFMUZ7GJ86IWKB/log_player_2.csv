**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's important to recognize the situation's dynamics.  

* **Inflation Impact:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential gain diminishes significantly. Waiting any longer means accepting an even smaller share or risking walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems content to continue negotiating,  likely aware that time is on her side. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between this offer and Bob's previous one is shrinking due to inflation. Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds might not be worth the loss already incurred. 

It's a tough choice, but at this point, accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than the potential for an even worse outcome in later rounds."
