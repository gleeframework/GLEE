"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but you'll have to do more than half. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. His offer is too generous in favor of himself, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 70% of the money, Bob. I'll do better than 50% but not that much.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I'm not giving you 70%. This is the best I can do, Bob.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the reduced value of the money and trying to find a middle ground between 50% and 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll need to reassess my priorities.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4. His offer is still a bit too generous in his favor, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 55% of the money, Bob. I think I deserve more for my patience and negotiation skills too.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more for my persistence. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, considering the continued inflation and my previous rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down. You're getting closer to my target, but I still think I deserve more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll need to think carefully about my next move.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6. His offer is still too generous in his favor, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% of the money, Bob. I think I deserve a better split, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to my original offer, Bob. I think it's time to end this game and split the remaining value fairly.""
}
```

I'm reverting to my initial proposal, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally settle on a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
