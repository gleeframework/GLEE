"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is more fair.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for Bob. I'd like to see a more significant reduction in his share.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to accept a fair split, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a significant portion of the money to be worth something in the long run. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share of the money, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth significantly less due to inflation, I'm getting desperate. However, I don't want to give up too much either. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Splitting it down the middle is still too generous for Bob, considering the inflation. I need to get more for my share to account for the decrease in value.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that splitting it down the middle is the fairest option, especially considering the inflation rates. I'll try to negotiate further."

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to get a significant portion of the money to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.""

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth significantly less due to inflation, I'm starting to get worried that I'll end up with nothing. However, Bob's offer of a 40/60 split is actually a decent compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think this is a fair compromise. Let's call it a day and split it 40/60. I'll take $6,000 and we can both walk away with something.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
