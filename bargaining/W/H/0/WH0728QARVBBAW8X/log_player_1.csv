"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80 dollars, and Bob will get 20 dollars. It's a fair and reasonable starting point, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my earnings.

I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my actual gain as 20 * 0.9 = 18 dollars.

With this in mind, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the continued inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

This way, I'll get 40 dollars, which is worth 36 dollars in the original currency (40 * 0.9), and Bob will get 60 dollars, which is worth 54 dollars in the original currency."
