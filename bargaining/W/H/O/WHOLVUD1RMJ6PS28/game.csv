90.0,10.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, your offer was quite bold.  How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  This round is your last chance to get a decent amount before inflation significantly eats into your potential gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob. But your offer is still too one-sided. Let's compromise: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We both get a reasonable amount before inflation really starts to bite.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, this is becoming tedious.  You're right, we need to compromise, but your sense of compromise seems skewed.  60/40 in my favor is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks every round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
