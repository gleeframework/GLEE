This is a tough decision, but I'm going to reject. The inflation is a big factor, and I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's turn the tables this round! I'm offering a 60/40 split, acknowledging the inflation factor.  Think about it, it's better than what you offered last time! ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more. Still a reasonable offer! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is hitting me hard, and while it's not ideal, it's better than getting even less in the next round."
