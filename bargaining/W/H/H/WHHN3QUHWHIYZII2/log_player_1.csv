"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation rates we're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer. I'll accept his proposal.
