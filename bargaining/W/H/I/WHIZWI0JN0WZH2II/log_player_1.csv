"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding. Considering the inflation rates, my $3,000 gain is worth 95% of the original $4,000 I was offered in the first round, and Bob's $7,000 gain is worth 80% of the original $4,000.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Your turn to meet me! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual values considering the inflation rates. My $4,500 gain is worth 90.5% of the original $6,000 I was offered in round 1, and Bob's $5,500 gain is worth 68.75% of the original $8,000 he was offered in round 1.

Considering the inflation rates, this offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
