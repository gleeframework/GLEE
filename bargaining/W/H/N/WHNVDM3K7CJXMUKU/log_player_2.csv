Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the money is losing value quickly for both players, especially Alice. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing in a future round. 

**Here's why:**

* **Declining the offer:** If Bob declines, he'll need to propose a split in Round 6 where the money is worth even less. Alice, desperate to get anything substantial, might reject anything that doesn't heavily favor her.
* **Inflation's impact:** The longer the game goes, the more both players lose. It's becoming a game of diminishing returns.

While Bob could gamble on Alice being desperate enough to accept a heavily skewed offer in his favor next round, it's a risky move. Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable, albeit not perfect, payout."
