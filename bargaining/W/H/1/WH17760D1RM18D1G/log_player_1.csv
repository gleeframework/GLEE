"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows for a significant portion for both parties, considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. It allows for a more balanced distribution, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
