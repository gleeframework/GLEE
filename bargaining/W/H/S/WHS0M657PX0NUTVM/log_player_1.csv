"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'll try to increase it in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to negotiate for a higher share, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
