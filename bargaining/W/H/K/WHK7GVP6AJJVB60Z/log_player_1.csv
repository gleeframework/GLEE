Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we should be closer to an even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering slightly more than before, the inflation is working against me. Accepting $45 now is significantly less valuable than accepting $40 in the first round.  I need to push for a better split before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. $50 each.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I need to make him see that dragging this out will only hurt us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and hopefully, he'll accept before the inflation gets any worse."
