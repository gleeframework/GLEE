"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see where the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'm now looking at $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. Meeting in the middle sounds fair, but I'm not sure if I'm getting enough considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after the first round and another 10% decrease, it's now worth 81% of its original value. So, I'm looking at $8,100.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60% share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,100 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so I'm now looking at $5,886.90.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. He's asking for $6,000, which is a 60% share, but I'm not sure if I'm getting enough considering the inflation.

However, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll accept this offer for now, as it's a better deal than what I had initially.
