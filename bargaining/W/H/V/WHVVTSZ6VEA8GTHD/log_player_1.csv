"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is actually worth less than I initially thought. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to avoid further negotiations and take advantage of the current value of the money."
