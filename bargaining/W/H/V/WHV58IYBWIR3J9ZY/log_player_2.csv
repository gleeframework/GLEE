"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  It might seem fair now, but the inflation will hurt Alice more than me in the later rounds. I can likely get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round. I'm proposing 60/40, but in my favor. You get to keep 40, and I'll take the remaining 60. We can still both benefit, especially as the rounds progress and the money loses value faster for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer isn't fair considering the faster rate of inflation for me.  How about a 55/45 split? It's a compromise that still gives you a decent portion. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, the inflation is definitely hitting Alice harder. This is a decent compromise that gives me a good share while recognizing the situation. I'll accept."
