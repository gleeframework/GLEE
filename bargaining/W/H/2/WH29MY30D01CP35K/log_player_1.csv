"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair we split it 60-40 in my favor, considering inflation hurts you less than me. Let's get this game started! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he's getting the better end of the deal!

However, I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for a better offer. The money is worth 5% less for me, but I'd still like to try to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
