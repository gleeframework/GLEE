# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, she's still clinging to a significant share of the money. I'm going to continue to push for a more even split, as the time is running out and the potential for both of us to get nothing is very real."
