"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting 60% since I'm the one proposing this time. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in this round, my potential gain is now 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time, Bob! I'll counter with a 55-45 split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my potential gain is 10% of 3600, which is 360.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one who's patient and willing to wait for a better deal!""
}
