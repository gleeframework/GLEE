"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we'll both go home happy. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a fair 300,000$. Time is running out, and it's only going to get worse for me.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse - but my patience is wearing thin. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is better than her last, I'm willing to gamble that Alice will be more amenable as the rounds progress and the pressure of the devaluation increases on me.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  We're both losing out the longer this goes on.  Let's end this now with a win-win."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, last chance. Take this offer or I walk.  Don't let greed cloud your judgement. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough call, but with the devaluation increasing, waiting any longer is incredibly risky. If I reject this and Alice is truly playing hardball, I could end up with nothing. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk losing it all."
