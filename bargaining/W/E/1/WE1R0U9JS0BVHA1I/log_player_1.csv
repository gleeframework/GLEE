I'm going for a slightly uneven split, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, the 20% inflation means it's less than what I offered Bob in the previous round. I'm hoping to get at least what I offered in the first round, or even a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still hoping for a deal close to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer again. While the inflation is getting serious, I still think I can get a better deal if I keep playing. It's getting risky, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting serious, so I need to make a compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now, even with the inflation."
