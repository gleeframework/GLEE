I'm going for a bold strategy here, Alice!  I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just a single dollar.  Let's see if he's feeling generous...  or desperate enough to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Inflation is a serious threat!"
