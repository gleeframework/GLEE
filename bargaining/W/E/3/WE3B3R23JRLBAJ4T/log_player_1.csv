"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. The message is a friendly invitation to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $9,000 is now worth $9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100.

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $3,000, which is worth $3,000 x 0.9 = $2,700 in the current round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
