Alice's offer:

Inflation might reduce the value, but I'm hoping to get more than 47.5% of the original amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a concession, Bob, but this has to be settled soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Although inflation is reducing the value, I'm hoping to get more than 45% of the original amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal for division. This time, my offer will be 525,000 for myself and 475,000 for Alice.\n\n###\n\nMy message: Come on, Alice! Let's meet in the middle. We can both walk away happy.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her response.\n\n###\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob gain"": 525000, ""Alice gain"": 475000}}\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money for me is 90.25% of the original, right? That means if I were to accept Alice's offer, I would effectively get 0.9025 * 450,000 = 406,125. Is that correct?"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice! Let's meet in the middle. We can both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for you with each round. Time to be realistic! 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, the effective value of the money for me is now 81.45% of the original amount. If I accept Alice's offer, I would get 0.8145 * 425,000 = 346,162.50. Given the decreasing value and Alice's message, I think it's time to accept this offer before it gets any worse.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer, and we can finalize the division of the $1,000,000.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the game is now over, correct? There will be no further rounds."
