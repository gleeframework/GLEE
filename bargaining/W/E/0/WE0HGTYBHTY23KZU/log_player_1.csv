"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too generous for Bob. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's response before making my next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob. I'll give you a decent share, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to do better. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful not to give up too much. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even smaller share. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
