"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's negotiating skills are worth an extra 2000$. I'd like to see a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't think I'm getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you're still getting a good chunk 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 35% share I'm being offered, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more than that""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob an even larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
