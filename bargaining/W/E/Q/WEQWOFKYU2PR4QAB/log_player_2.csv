Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  Since my gains are worth less with each round, I'm willing to give you a bit more.  I propose 4750/5250.  Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750
