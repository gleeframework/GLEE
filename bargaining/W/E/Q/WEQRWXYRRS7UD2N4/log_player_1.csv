"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it more evenly.  Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 40 is now worth 32, and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 57.60.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit skewed towards Bob. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this split. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's try this split.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
