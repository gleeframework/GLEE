"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I lose more if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. With the inflation, Alice loses more than me, so she might be willing to compromise more in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take advantage of Alice's higher inflation rate and make an offer that's slightly more in my favor.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You lose more if we wait, so let's settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting both of us, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from ending the game now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth for both of us, but Alice is affected more. This offer seems like a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here and take the offer."
