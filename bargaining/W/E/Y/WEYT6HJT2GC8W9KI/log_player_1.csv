Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer undervalues my position given the rapid inflation we face. Let's be fair, this offer accounts for the time-sensitive nature of our deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a final attempt to find middle ground. Accept it, and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with the decreasing value, Bob's offer is getting closer to even, but it's still advantageous for him.  I'm willing to gamble another round that he'll become more desperate as his share loses value far quicker than mine."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It reflects the urgency of the situation while still offering you a reasonable share considering the rapid devaluation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm also drawing a firm line. Bob's share is rapidly losing value, and this offer is likely the best he'll get at this point. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on him to accept before his potential gain diminishes further."
