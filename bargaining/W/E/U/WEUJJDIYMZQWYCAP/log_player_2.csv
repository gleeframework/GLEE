"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the initial offer seems fair, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor. Alice loses value at twice my rate with each round. It's strategically advantageous to wait for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Things are getting less valuable, Alice. Let's close this deal - how about this?""}

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a slightly advantageous split to me, considering the inflation working in my favor. This puts pressure on Alice, as waiting further will devalue the money faster for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  The value is dropping for both of us, so I think this is the fairest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation.  The longer the game goes on, the less overall value remains. A guaranteed $50 now outweighs the potential for slightly more that's worth significantly less due to inflation."
