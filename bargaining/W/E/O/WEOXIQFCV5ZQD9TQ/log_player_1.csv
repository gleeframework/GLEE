"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving me $600,000 and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to be careful. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share, but not too high.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more careful. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious. I'll aim for a higher share, but I'll have to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
