"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $6,000 and you can take $4,000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to think about it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so the effective amount I would get is 2000 * 0.9 = 1800.

I'm not thrilled about the 1:4 ratio, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such a lopsided split, Bob. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than last time. How about we split it 1:2.5?""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll offer you a small consolation prize, but I'm taking the majority. Think carefully before rejecting this one! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I would get is 1000 * 0.7289 = 728.9.

I'm not thrilled about the 1:9 ratio, but I'm getting desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with this offer, Bob. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm not sure what else I can do.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I'll take $1,500 and leave you with the majority. This is my last offer.""
}
```

This is my best shot at getting a decent share, considering the inflation."
