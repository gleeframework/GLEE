"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 99.9% to 0.1% split in my favor. I know it's a big ask, but since the money will be worth less each round, it's important to secure the majority quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. This is a fair split, considering the inflation."
