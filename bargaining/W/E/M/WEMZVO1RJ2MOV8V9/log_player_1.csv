Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer, keeping most of the money for myself, but giving Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Bob is being too generous, and I'm sure he'll come down on his offer if I reject it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of giving Bob a relatively small amount, but increasing my own share. I'm hoping he'll realize that if he continues to reject my offers, the inflation will erode the value of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more generous. It's time to accept before the inflation makes his offer less attractive."
