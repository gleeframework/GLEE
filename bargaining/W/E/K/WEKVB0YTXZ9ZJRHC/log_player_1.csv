"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, giving me a slight edge, but it's a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd get $540,000 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd get $475,000 in this round.

Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less due to inflation. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'd get $729,900 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so he'd get $432,400 in this round.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think I should accept it to avoid losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
