"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the lion's share.  This is a good deal for you, Bob.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take $100,000, it's a small percentage of the total.  There's a good chance Alice will offer more in the next round to avoid losing even more money to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risks of inflation.""
