"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it seems like the fairest starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While I'm losing value with each round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal than a 40/60 split.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split. This is a compromise from my initial 50/50 proposal, but still fair considering the inflation factor. Hopefully, Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  While the inflation is getting more severe, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself than a 38/62 split.  Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split.  I'm trying to find a middle ground, but it's getting harder with the inflation.  Hopefully, Bob will realize he's not getting much more by continuing and will accept this offer."
