"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'll give Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather have a higher share of the reduced amount than a smaller share of the original amount. Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the decreasing value of the money.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
