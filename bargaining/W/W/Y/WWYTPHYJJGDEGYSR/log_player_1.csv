"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is closer to my initial proposal, but still not ideal.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I still need to get a bit more.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a decent compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

I'll think about it... Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. I'm not thrilled about giving up more, but I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
