"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better offer this time, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

After considering the offer, I've decided to reject it. The money is worth 20% less now, so the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $300,000 (20% of $500,000)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (20% of $3,500,000)

I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me less than half of the total amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority of the money. This way, I'm hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal."
