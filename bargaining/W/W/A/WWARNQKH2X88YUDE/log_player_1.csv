Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start fair!  50/50 seems like the most logical way to split it initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I'm not adverse to getting a bit less than 50/50, I think I can do better than 40/60 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to 55%. I figure Bob will want to avoid further inflation and take this offer before it gets worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not the 50/50 split I initially hoped for, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal. The inflation is hurting him more, so I'll take this opportunity to end the game."
