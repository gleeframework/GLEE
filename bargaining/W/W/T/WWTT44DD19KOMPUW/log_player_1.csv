"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease by 20% with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about your idea of a fair split, but I'm willing to start with a 3:1 ratio. Let's see if you'll accept. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's 3:1 ratio is quite lopsided, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a new proposal from Bob. The value of the money is already decreasing, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the ratio, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. Let's try 3:2 instead.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the remaining value of the money, and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a more balanced ratio, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with a 3:2 ratio, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Will you accept a 5:5 ratio? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 5:5 ratio is a more even split, but I'm not sure if it's the best option considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a new proposal from Bob. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try a 55:45 ratio. It's not perfect, but it's closer to what I'm comfortable with.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the remaining value of the money, and keeping $550,000 for myself. This ratio is closer to a 50:50 split, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close, but I'm not ready to accept a ratio that favors you. How about we meet at 51:49? It's a small concession from my side, but I'm willing to try to make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 51:49 ratio is a very close split, and I'm not sure if I should push for a better deal or accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I think this is a fair compromise. I'll take $500,000 and consider it a good deal."
