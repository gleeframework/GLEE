"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 (since it's 10% less than the $400,000 in round 1). And Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $570,000 (since it's 5% less than the $600,000 in round 1).

I'll reject this offer, since I'd prefer to get more than $360,000. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take a smaller share, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
