"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
