Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30, I'm going to try to do a bit better. I'll offer a 55/45 split, hoping to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer.

# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting really concerned about the value of my share.

However, Bob's offer is still not bad, and I'm getting desperate too. I'll take the 75/25 split, hoping that it's the best I can get.
