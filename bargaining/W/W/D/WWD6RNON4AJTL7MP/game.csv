45.0,55.0,Let's be fair. How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the inflation that affects you more than me.,Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"I understand the inflation disparity, but 55/45 is too much of a difference. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's important to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Every round that passes hurts you significantly more than me.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise. 55/45 is my final offer.  We need to settle this before the inflation eats away at the value any further.",Alice,5,
