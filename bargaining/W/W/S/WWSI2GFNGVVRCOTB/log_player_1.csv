"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. This is a risky strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very similar situation to the last round, just flipped. Since the money has lost value for Bob, I can likely push for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer to Bob a bit more, but not completely.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to tempt him into accepting, as he knows I'm willing to be more generous in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the money Bob gains is now worth significantly less due to inflation, it's still more than what I would receive in the next round. I think it's better to secure a small gain rather than risk getting nothing at all."
