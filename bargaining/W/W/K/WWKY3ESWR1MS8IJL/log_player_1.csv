"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this proposal and avoiding further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice.  This is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's end this game and move on to something more fun! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is as generous as he claims. I think he's trying to take advantage of me with a slightly higher share. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not buying it, Bob. I'm willing to make a better offer.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the times we're living in. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable this time, but I'm still holding firm on the numbers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be sensible.  50/50 is the only fair way to split this, considering the current inflation.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of fairness. A 50/50 split might seem reasonable, but I'm not convinced that it's the best deal for me, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, Bob. I'm not ready to give up yet.""
}
```

I'll reject his offer and try to make another proposal that takes into account the current state of the economy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, considering the reduced value of the money."
