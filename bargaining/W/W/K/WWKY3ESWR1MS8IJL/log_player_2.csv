I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for such a small portion!  Let's see what Alice will offer next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice.  This is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's end this game and move on to something more fun!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair split, considering the times we're living in. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting, I'm not going to settle for such a low share.  Alice clearly isn't taking inflation into account, which is making her offer worse with each round. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we both know this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be sensible.  50/50 is the only fair way to split this, considering the current inflation.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time to make a move, Bob. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting too risky.  Alice seems to be playing this game to the end, and with each passing round, my share is getting smaller.  I'll accept this offer, even though it's not ideal, before the inflation completely decimates my potential winnings."
