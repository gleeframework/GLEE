"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation scenario. I'm going to start by offering a seemingly generous proposal, but one that also gives me the largest portion of the pie.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not fair. I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly, keeping in mind the inflation rates. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I need to be more realistic to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is not ideal, considering the inflation, it's better to accept than to risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation will eat away at my potential gains further."
