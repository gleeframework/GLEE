"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 5000 is now worth less than my initial proposal of 6000. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken a toll on the money's value, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, but still trying to maximize my own gain. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! With my gain worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, Bob's offer is still not very appealing to me.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and hope that I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is really eating away at the money's value now. I need to be more aggressive with my offer to make up for it. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm going back to my original proposal from Round 1, but with a slightly more favorable split for myself. It's time for Bob to make a move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. My gain of 6000 is worth less than my initial proposal of 6000, and Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him. However, I don't see a better option, and I'm running out of time.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and I'll just have to live with the consequences of inflation."
