"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000 and give Bob $400,000. I've included a message, ""Let's compromise,"" to suggest a middle ground that benefits both parties. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I'm starting with a slightly higher share, anticipating potential future rounds where Bob might be more inclined to accept a deal due to the devaluing of his share over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current situation, accepting Bob's offer of $400,000 doesn't seem advantageous to me, especially since the value of the money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, potentially leveraging the fact that the money's value decreases for Bob might make him more inclined to accept a future offer that is still favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle of our offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'm adjusting my offer to meet halfway between my initial proposal and Bob's offer from Round 2, suggesting a compromise. Given the inflation affecting Bob's share, I'm slightly favoring my side but still aiming for a balance that might be acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of his potential gain over time."
