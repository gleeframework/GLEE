"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bigger piece for myself. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'd rather not give up 60% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (since 0.8^2 = 0.64). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to catch up.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, I'll give you a smaller share this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm being squeezed too hard. I'd rather not give up 80% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm getting desperate!

The money is now worth only 51.2% of its original value (since 0.8^3 = 0.512). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of patience, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a very small share, but I'm not going to give up. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm running out of options!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm being offered a very small share, but it's still more than I would get if I wait for the next round. The money is worth only 51.2% of its original value now (since 0.8^4 = 0.512), and it's decreasing rapidly. I'll take what I can get.
