"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 300,000
* Bob gain: 700,000

I'm not too thrilled about the large difference in the split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
