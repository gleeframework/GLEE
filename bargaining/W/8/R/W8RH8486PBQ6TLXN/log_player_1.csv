"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80, you can take 20. Let's see if we can improve from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20. I'm keeping the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 80, now it's my turn to be more generous, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to be more generous in the second round.

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, although it's a 50/50 split, the money is now worth 20% less than in the first round, so the actual value of the money is $80. I'd like to try to negotiate for more."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% is 64%), I'll make a new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can take 40. We're getting closer to a fair split, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.""

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is repeating the same offer from the previous round, which I rejected. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer as well:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
