"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While this seems a bit lopsided, I'm hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on before the inflation starts affecting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While a 50/50 split is far less favorable than my initial proposal, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  With each round, my gains are diminished, so accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money before the inflation continues to eat away at my share."
