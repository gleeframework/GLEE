"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping to secure the lion's share of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my first offer! While it's tempting to take the 100,000, I'm going to reject.  I'm not going to be taken advantage of like that.  I'll take my chances with the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. I'm hoping that this will be more appealing to him, given the inflation he's facing. I still want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also trying to avoid getting stuck with nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still sticking to his pattern of reversing my offers. While 200,000 is better than nothing,  it's not enough for me to consider accepting. I'm going to keep playing and see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep refusing Bob's offers, but I'm determined to get at least a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for more. I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation, but I can't give in to Bob's demands just yet. I'm going to keep playing and hope for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a lower offer, hoping Bob will finally accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure something before it's too late.  600,000 is a lot less than I initially wanted, but it's still a significant portion of the money.  I hope Bob sees reason and takes this deal."
