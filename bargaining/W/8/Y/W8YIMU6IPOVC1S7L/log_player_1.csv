"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to maximize my gain in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, does he?

I'll take a closer look at his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm still not getting enough!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 15% of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in round 2, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise time! Take 80% and let's move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 80% of the remaining amount, which is a significant concession from my previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high, I'll give you a better deal if you meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll take a look at Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite meeting me in the middle, but I'll try to meet you in the middle!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal than 30% of the remaining amount. I'll try to meet him in the middle, but I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less now, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 35-65, it's a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 65% of the remaining amount, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you have to meet me at 60-40! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'll take a look at Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 60-40 it is! Let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'm not sure if I can do better. Meeting him at 60-40 seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
