"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that benefits me more, considering the inflation.
###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. I suggest we settle this quickly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer since the inflation is indeed working against me, and Alice's offer seems reasonable considering the circumstances. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me."
