"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you get 40.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation penalty isn't too bad for me, and I'm hoping Alice will be more generous next time to avoid losing 10% of the money's value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take 55 and you get 45. It's a better deal for you than what you'll get if we wait another round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a fair offer, and considering the inflation penalty, it's better for me to accept this offer now rather than risking further depreciation. I'm getting 50, which is more than what I would have gotten in the first round, and Alice is being reasonable by offering an even split. I'll take it!"
