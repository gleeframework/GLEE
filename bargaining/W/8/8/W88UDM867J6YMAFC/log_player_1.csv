"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a very small amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's try for something more realistic 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to negotiate a more realistic split.

I'll reject this offer since I'd like to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can still end the game soon.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too soft on me, I want more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, my offer is worth less and less each round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 70% of the remaining money, and I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money I gain is worth 19.15% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a firmer offer, but still leave some room for negotiation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no more haggling.""
}
```"
