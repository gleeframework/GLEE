"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400,000,
  ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's start with a compromise.""
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor this time. It's a fair chance to see if you're open to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too keen on giving Bob the upper hand. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counter-proposal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to flip the script, but I'm not buying it. I'll make a new offer that's more in my favor.""
}"

  ""bob_gain"": 450,000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a 60/40 split, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle.""
}

I'm trying to take a more aggressive stance, but still leave some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 550000

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, Bob? I'll try to take it up a notch. I'm willing to give you a 52/48 split, but that's as low as I'll go.""
}"
