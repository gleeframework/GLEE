Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value every round, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse.

# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
