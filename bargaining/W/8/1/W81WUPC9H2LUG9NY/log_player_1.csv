I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing it's better to get something than risk losing it all to inflation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'll reject this offer.  While the money is worth less, it's still a huge amount and I'm willing to risk a few rounds to get a better deal."

Round 5

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair, even though the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I'm not going to accept this. I'm hoping that he'll finally realize that we need to come to a more reasonable compromise if we both want to get anything at all.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if he'll change his mind."

```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, even though the value of the money is getting lower and lower. I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's drastically unfair. I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the sense in compromise before we both lose everything to inflation."
