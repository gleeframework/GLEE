Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going for an even split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly stubborn and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). While 43 is a terrible deal, accepting anything less than an even split in the next few rounds will net me a pittance due to the rapid inflation. I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, she will realize time is running out and offer a more reasonable split."
