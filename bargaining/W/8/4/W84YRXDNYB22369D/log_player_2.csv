Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer is still too high.  I'm willing to be more reasonable and split 60/40, but in my favor this time.  We can keep negotiating, but this is a fair compromise considering the risk of further inflation.
