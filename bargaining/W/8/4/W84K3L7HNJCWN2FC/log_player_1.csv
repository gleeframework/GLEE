"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll need to be cautious. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","The stakes are rising!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

I'm not sure if this is the best offer, but it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll take it.
