55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we take $55 and you take $45.  This way we both benefit from dividing the money early.",Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 52-48 split is more reasonable. This way, we both still benefit from dividing the money early, but I get a slightly larger share to account for the decrease in value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
53.0,47.0,"Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't quite balanced.  How about a 53-47 split?  We can avoid further losses from inflation this way.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway at a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, but I'm actually getting less value due to the inflation. Let's settle on this to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
