Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 52-48 split is more reasonable. This way, we both still benefit from dividing the money early, but I get a slightly larger share to account for the decrease in value. 
# Alice gain: 48

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
