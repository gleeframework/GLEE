"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we take $55 and you take $45.  This way we both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I should try to get a better deal than 45% of the original amount. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I will try to get a better deal than 45% of the original amount. Considering the discount, I will aim for a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 52-48 split is more reasonable. This way, we both still benefit from dividing the money early, but I get a slightly larger share to account for the decrease in value.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't quite balanced.  How about a 53-47 split?  We can avoid further losses from inflation this way. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth 19% less for me now, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of 47% is closer to what I want, but considering the increasing loss in value, I'll try to get an even better offer in the next round. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer. I'll prepare my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money is now worth 19% less for me, I need to adjust my proposal to account for this loss in value. Since Alice's previous offer was 53-47, I'll try to meet her halfway while still considering the inflation.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway at a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, but I'm actually getting less value due to the inflation. Let's settle on this to avoid further losses.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
