"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the original amount. This way, I'll get 60% of the original amount, which is 600,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000 dollars, which is 58% of the current value, and I'll get 42% of the current value, which is 420,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is worth much less. However, I still need to make a decision.

I'll accept this offer. 100,000 dollars is better than nothing, and it's not worth risking further inflation and potentially ending up with even less.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
