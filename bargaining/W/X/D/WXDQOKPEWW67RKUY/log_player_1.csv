"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's try to get closer to a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $6,000 * 0.95 = $5,700
* Bob gain: $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit better, but I'm still hoping for a more equal split. Let's try to get closer to 50/50.""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping for a more equal split in the next round."
