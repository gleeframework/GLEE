Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's fair, considering I'm the one making the offer first. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money is now worth less, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
