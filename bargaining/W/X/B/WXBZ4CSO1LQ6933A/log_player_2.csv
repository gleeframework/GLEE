"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60, you take 40.  Seems like a good starting point.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too favorable towards you. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This accounts for the time value of money, as it'll be worth less if we wait longer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. It's clear we're both stubborn, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to end this. No more time to waste on negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
