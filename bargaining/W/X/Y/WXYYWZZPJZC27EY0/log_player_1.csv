I'm going to start by offering a very generous deal to Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 50% is a fair split, and the inflation means the money is worth less with each round.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
