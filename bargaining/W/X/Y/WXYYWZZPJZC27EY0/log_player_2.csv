"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 90 for her and 10 for me, I'll try to get more for myself. However, I also need to keep in mind that the money's value is decreasing over time. 

I'll make a counteroffer:
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
