Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Since I'm going first, I want to secure a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best option.  I'm already losing 20% of my money's value, and it's likely Bob will get a better deal next round if I reject."
