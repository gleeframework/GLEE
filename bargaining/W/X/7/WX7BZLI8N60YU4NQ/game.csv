58.0,42.0,"Considering the inflation, my share remains the same, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than before. Take it before the money devalues further!",Alice,3,

52.0,48.0,"Alice, it's clear you're aiming for a larger share, and I respect that. But the clock is ticking, and we both lose if this fails.  This is a compromise to consider before it's too late.",Bob,6,

56.0,44.0,"You're right, time is running out, and I'm willing to make a small concession. This is likely the best offer you'll get from me, so I suggest you take it before the money loses even more value for you!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
53.0,47.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 47/53 split.  It's a slight adjustment from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but it's crucial we settle this now before inflation eats away at any potential gain for me.",Bob,8,
