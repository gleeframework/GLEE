**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a very strong game, taking advantage of my diminishing returns. However, she's also showing a willingness to negotiate slightly. Holding out a bit longer might force her to offer a slightly better deal, even if it's still in her favor. The risk is that she becomes more aggressive as the rounds decrease."
