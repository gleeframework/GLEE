"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. I'm being generous to start, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I think we can both do better. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so if I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is equivalent to $44 in the first round. That's not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine was in the first round, and I don't want to risk going into another round and potentially getting a worse deal.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
