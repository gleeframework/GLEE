"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a positive note!"
