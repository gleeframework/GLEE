600000.0,400000.0,Let's split the money 3:2. This seems fair given the risk and uncertainty of future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I propose we split the money 6:4.  This is a more favorable split for me considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50/50 split is fair given the uncertainty and risk of future rounds. It ensures both of us receive an equal share of the remaining funds.,Alice,3,
