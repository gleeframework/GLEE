"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hitting us both hard. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best option. The money is worth less with each passing round, and I don't want to risk losing more value. Splitting it evenly at this point is a reasonable compromise."
