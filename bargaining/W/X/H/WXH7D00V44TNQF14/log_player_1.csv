"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I'm confident that I can do better. It's not a good idea to settle for less, especially with the potential for even more inflation in the future. Let's see if I can sway Bob's decision in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my stake again, but I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate. This offer is a good compromise, and I hope it convinces Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. While inflation is a factor, I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than what I believe I deserve. I'll see if I can convince Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that with the pressure of inflation, Bob will be more willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with inflation biting, I can't accept an even split. Bob's offer is  a significant step backwards from my original offer, and it's clear he's trying to take advantage of the situation.  I have to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. I'm dropping my demand slightly, hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not going to let him completely dominate the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially with the pressure of inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation really starting to hurt, I'm taking a major risk.  I'm willing to settle for an even split.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree to it before the next round, when I'll be facing even more drastic losses."
