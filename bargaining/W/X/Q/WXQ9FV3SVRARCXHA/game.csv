650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but your last offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. How about a split of 65/35?  It's a much better deal for you than waiting any longer.",Alice,3,

580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains. I'm willing to come down a bit to 42/58. Let's close this deal and avoid getting nothing.",Bob,4,

620000.0,380000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to be realistic. 62/38 is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're running out of time and the money is losing value fast!",Alice,5,
