Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor, as I am taking the risk of declining your previous offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation impacting the value of the money for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
