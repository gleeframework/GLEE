"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can adjust in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob! While starting ""fair"" sounds nice, Alice is heavily favored in later rounds due to the inflation working against Bob.  Bob needs to push for a much better deal early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's not a sustainable starting point considering the inflation. I need a larger share upfront to offset the decreasing value. Let's be reasonable and aim for a fair outcome.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 60/40 split is fair given the inflation. Let's avoid further rounds and reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not a good deal for Bob.  Even though Alice moved a bit,  a 60/40 split heavily favors her in the long run. Bob needs to hold firm and make it clear that a much more balanced deal is necessary."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at the value.  My offer is a compromise, reflecting the urgency of the situation. Let's close this deal.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to meet in the middle.  The inflation is hurting both of us.  55/45 is the fairest split we can reach, let's do it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is agonizing, but Bob still needs to reject. Alice is right that the inflation hurts both of them - but it disproportionately hurts Bob. Accepting 45% now means settling for less than half the original value. He needs to signal he's willing to risk it all for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 625000,
""alice_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree.  This split acknowledges the time pressure while still aiming for some fairness. It's time to be decisive.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline.  We need to find a compromise quickly.  Let's split the money 50/50 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to say this, but Bob needs to accept. 

While a 50/50 split seemed unfair earlier, the relentless inflation has backed Bob into a corner. Accepting 50% now, though heavily impacted by inflation, is better than risking a complete loss if the rounds run out."
