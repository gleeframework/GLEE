"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I get a slight majority, but it's still a reasonable offer. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'll still give you a good deal. Consider this a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are a bit less favorable for me, but I still think Bob's offer is reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 5800$. It's not as good as the 6000 I initially proposed, but it's a compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values."
