"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 90 dollars and Bob taking 10.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk, and it gives Bob a chance to get some money without risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is better than getting nothing, it's still a significant loss compared to my initial offer. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit from my first offer, but I still need to get a fair share considering the inflation. This offer gives Bob a chance to get something, while still allowing me to get a decent portion of the money."
