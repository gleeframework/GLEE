"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to propose. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is now worth 90.5% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 30 is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one""
}
```

I'm mirroring Bob's message from the previous round and making a similar offer, but with a slightly more favorable split for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm getting worried about the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 75 is actually worth 86.5% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 25 is worth 32% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think Bob is getting a bit more desperate, and I'm getting a better share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal and end the game."
