Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob is losing value faster. While her offer acknowledges the inflation difference, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm and signal he's willing to risk it all for a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Enough games, Alice. This is a fair split. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on.  Bob needs to make a strong move before the rapidly increasing inflation eats away too much of his potential gain.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair. This offer eliminates the inflation argument and puts the onus on Alice to accept a reasonable deal or risk losing everything. 
* **Strong Signal:**  By making his most generous offer yet, Bob is signaling that he's serious. He's willing to risk it all on a fair deal rather than be slowly bled dry by Alice's increasingly unreasonable demands."
