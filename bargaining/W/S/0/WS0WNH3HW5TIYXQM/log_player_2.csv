Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's be fair and split it evenly - $5000 each. It's the best way to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
