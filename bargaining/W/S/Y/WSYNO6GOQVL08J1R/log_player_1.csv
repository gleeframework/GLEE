"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. Take it while it's still worth something!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I aim for a significant portion of the money (65%) upfront. This establishes a strong initial position.
* **Inflation Factor:**  While I lose 5% per round, Bob loses a whopping 20%. Delaying is far more detrimental to him. The message highlights this urgency. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer isn't so extreme that it's likely to be rejected outright. It leaves space for Bob to counter-offer in a way that could still benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a reasonable starting point. I'm proposing a more equitable split.  Let's be fair to each other. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's definition of ""equitable"" is heavily skewed in his favor. While he frames it as fairness, the reality is that he's trying to take advantage of the rapid inflation working against him.  

Here's why rejecting is the better strategy:

* **Inflation is My Ally:** Every round that passes hurts Bob significantly more than it hurts me. By rejecting, I force him to make another offer in a situation where his potential gains have shrunk considerably.
* **Demonstrating Resolve:**  Accepting this offer would signal that I'm willing to settle for a weak position. By rejecting, I communicate that I'm not easily swayed and am willing to play the game strategically.
* **Potential for a Better Offer:**  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Bob will become. There's a good chance he'll offer a larger share in the next round just to avoid further losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob.  This is a compromise you should seriously consider.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my demand slightly from the initial 65% to 55%. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the increasing pressure on Bob due to inflation.  Every round makes a significant dent in his potential gains, encouraging him to settle quickly.
* **Balancing Act:**  This offer is a calculated risk. It's possible Bob will dig in his heels and try to push for an even better deal. However, the rapidly diminishing returns for both of us make this offer increasingly attractive for him as time passes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is now within the realm of acceptable given the circumstances:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is rapidly declining for both of us. Waiting any longer significantly risks getting a smaller net gain, even if I could secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Finality:**  His language suggests this is his last stand. It's unlikely he'll offer more, and there's a real risk he'll lowball me further in a desperate attempt to salvage something.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  This is a negotiation, and compromise is essential. 45% of a rapidly shrinking pie is better than holding out for an idealistic figure and potentially ending up with even less."
