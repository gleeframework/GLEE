Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Devaluation is hitting you harder, I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the devaluation is hurting, accepting $350,000 is a terrible deal. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking further devaluation. There's a chance Bob will get nervous as we get closer to the later rounds and offer a larger sum."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 729000,
""bob_gain"": 271000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it - the devaluation will only get worse for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob.  He knows that if he rejects this, I'll likely offer him a minimal amount in the next round, gambling that he'd rather take something now than risk getting even less later.  This offer, while impacted by devaluation, still secures a significant sum for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, my offer is getting less generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the devaluation is becoming critical. Accepting $300,000 now is significantly better than risking another round where Bob's offer could be even lower, or where I'm forced to make a desperate offer to avoid getting a pittance in round 8.  While I'd prefer more, getting something is better than the potential of getting almost nothing if I continue to play chicken with Bob."
