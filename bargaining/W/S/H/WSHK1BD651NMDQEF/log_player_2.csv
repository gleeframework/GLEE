"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money now, but you'll get a bigger share in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided deal right away. There's a good chance I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer.  Let's start with this, and we can negotiate further if you prefer.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
