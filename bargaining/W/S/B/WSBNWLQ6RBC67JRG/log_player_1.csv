I propose that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This ensures that I get a good share of the money while still giving Bob a fair amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose we split the money 55/45, with me getting 55. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, recognizing the impact of inflation. This offer is still fair given the reduced value of the money, and I believe it will lead to a quick agreement."
