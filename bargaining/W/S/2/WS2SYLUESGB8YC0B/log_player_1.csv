"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of the original amount ($400,000), and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of the original amount ($450,000).

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
