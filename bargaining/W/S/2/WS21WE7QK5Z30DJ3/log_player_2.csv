"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal.  It's early in the game, and the money will be worth a lot less in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 65/35 in your favor, but I think that's fair considering the money will depreciate in value each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, 55-45 is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like more, the money is depreciating rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round.  I'll accept the 55-45 split."
