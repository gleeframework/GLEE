"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 500,000 in this round is actually worth 450,000 in the previous round's value.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This time, I'll get 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 60%."
