"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get the same amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
