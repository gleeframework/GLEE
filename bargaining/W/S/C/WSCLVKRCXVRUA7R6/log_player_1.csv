"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, will receive $550,000, and Bob will receive $450,000. The message I included is ""Let's divide fairly,"" which suggests that the division is slightly in my favor but still relatively equitable, considering the impact of inflation on my future gains. This initial offer sets the stage for negotiations, allowing Bob to either accept or counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more significant share this time. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer in this round. Although the money's value decreases by 5% for me due to inflation, accepting $400,000 in this round would mean I'm settling for less than half of the original amount. Given that we have 10 more rounds to negotiate and the fact that Bob's offer significantly favors him, I believe there's room for further negotiation to achieve a more balanced division. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leveraging the time constraint and inflation factor to reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the impact of inflation on my potential gains. By proposing that I receive $520,000 and Bob receive $480,000, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for me while still being mindful of Bob's interests. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle"" aims to convey the reasoning behind my proposal and encourage Bob to consider the effects of inflation in his decision-making. This approach seeks to balance the negotiation, taking into account the time pressure and the devaluation of the money for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at your share. Let's settle this now with a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the increasing pressure from inflation, which has now reduced the value of my potential gains by 14.26%, I decide to reject Bob's offer in this round. Bob's proposal of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him still seems too skewed in his favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. By rejecting this offer, I aim to signal that I am willing to continue negotiations to achieve a more balanced division. With 8 rounds remaining, there is still time to find a compromise that better reflects the effects of inflation on my potential gains. My next offer will need to strategically account for the decreasing value of the money and the urgency to reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Split down the middle considering the time and inflation pressure.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to propose an equal split of $500,000 for both me and Bob. This offer acknowledges the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, which are now worth 14.26% less than in the first round. By suggesting a 50/50 split, I'm attempting to find a fair and straightforward solution that considers the time pressure and the devaluation of the money for me. The message ""Split down the middle considering the time and inflation pressure"" aims to convey the rationale behind my proposal, emphasizing the need for a balanced agreement given the circumstances. This approach seeks to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the mutual benefit of reaching a deal before the value of the money decreases further for me."
