"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer ensures you get the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept. Since the money depreciates for Bob in subsequent rounds, he might be willing to take this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money.  With each round, Bob's share depreciates while mine remains the same. It's unlikely he'll offer me a better deal in future rounds."
