"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I need to take this into account when evaluating the offer.

If Bob's gain is $8,000, it's actually worth $8,000 / 0.8 = $10,000 in the first round's value. So, Bob is offering me $2,000 and himself $10,000 in the first round's value.

I'll accept this offer.
