5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in your favor.  I'm sure you realize the money will be worth less for both of us if we delay further.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, time is running out, especially for you. I'm proposing 65/35. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Accept it, and we both walk away with something.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this 58/42 split in your favor and let's end this. Every round costs us both. Don't get greedy.",Bob,4,
