"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me almost all the money. I'm hoping Bob, being unfamiliar with the inflation factor, will accept this offer, especially since I'm giving him something.  However, if he rejects, I'll have to consider a more balanced approach in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action.  I know that Bob is aware of the inflation factor, even if I don't know the exact details for him.  He is offering a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances.  Rejecting this offer would mean I have to make an offer in the next round, and given the inflation factor, I don't want to risk losing out on this potential gain."
