"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $3,000 is worth 90% of the original $4,000, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,750.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45/55 split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can't expect me to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

My gain of $2,000 is worth 20% of the original $10,000, which is $2,000.
Bob's gain of $8,000 is worth 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but I'll think it over. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
