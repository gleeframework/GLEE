"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80/20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, let's start with a fair split. I'll meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being a bit too greedy, Alice. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to keep more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $2,112 in real terms.
