Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's speed things up. This is more fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a tough one. Bob's offer is tempting because of the inflation, but accepting now means settling for less than what I initially proposed. I need to push for a better deal while there's still time.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a difficult situation. Bob clearly senses my desperation due to the inflation.  Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** 350,000 (heavily impacted by inflation)
* **Round 3 Offer:** 550,000 (would be worth less now due to inflation)
* **Potential Future Offers:**  Uncertain, but likely to be worse than Bob's current offer as time runs out.

If I reject, there's a chance I could get a slightly better offer from Bob in the next round, but it's highly unlikely he'll go back to 400,000. Plus, each round makes the potential gains less appealing.

This is a gamble. I need to decide if holding out for a slightly better deal is worth the risk of ending up with nothing. 

In this scenario, I'm leaning towards accepting. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away empty-handed.
