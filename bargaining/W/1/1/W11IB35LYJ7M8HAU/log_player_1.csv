"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 80/20, I'll take the majority for now, but I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a rough 80/20 split, but I'm leaving the door open for negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
