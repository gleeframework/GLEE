Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more. You're losing value, so let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of waiting is diminishing rapidly for Bob.  

* **Round 1 Equivalent:** Alice's offer of $43 is worth approximately $17.20 in Round 1 terms due to the 59.04% inflation hit (43 * (1-0.5904) â‰ˆ 17.20). 
* **Further Decline:**  If Bob rejects this offer, the value of his potential gains will decrease even further in the next round. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking an even worse outcome in later rounds where the value of his share will be minuscule."
