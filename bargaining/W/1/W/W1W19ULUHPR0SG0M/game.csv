7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced approach, considering the value of money will decrease faster for you in subsequent rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 52.5/47.5 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in future rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share to account for the faster decrease in my purchasing power. This 55/45 split should be more reasonable.",Bob,4,
