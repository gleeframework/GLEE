,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rate impacts us differently.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.,Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the sentiment, that split still heavily favors you, Bob. Let's try to find a more balanced agreement.",Alice,2,reject

,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  This offer reflects the inflation and gives us both a decent share.",Bob,4,
,,"This is closer, Bob, but still not equitable given that the money loses value for me faster than it does for you. We have time for one more round of offers from each of us before the stakes get too high.",Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. It's crucial we settle this now to avoid significant losses for both of us due to inflation. This split acknowledges your lower inflation rate while securing a reasonable amount for me.",Alice,5,
