"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I need the majority of the money to ensure my future.  Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with only 100,000. I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split. This is a fair and reasonable deal that allows us both to get a significant portion of the money.  Let's end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need the larger share. Let's reach a deal before we both lose out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too low. While her message suggests compromise, the proposed split is still heavily in her favor. I'm willing to keep playing and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable here. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's cut our losses and call it even.""}
