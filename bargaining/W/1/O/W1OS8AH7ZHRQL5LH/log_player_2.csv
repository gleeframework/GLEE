"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a fairer split, time is working against me more than her.  I need to push for a better deal quickly, or risk settling for an even less favorable outcome in later rounds."
