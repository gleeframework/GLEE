"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game underway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take the majority of the cash, but I'll still give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'm not thrilled with the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of my potential gains. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
