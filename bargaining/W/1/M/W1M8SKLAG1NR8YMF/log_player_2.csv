"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation factor might make it advantageous to wait and see if Alice gets more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to accept a 70/30 split in my favor.  Remember, the clock is ticking, and inflation is working against us both!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your generosity is touching, but let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Although I'd prefer a higher share, the time pressure and inflation are starting to become significant.  Getting 4500 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
