Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less since the money's value doesn't change for me 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""The money is quickly losing value, Bob.  Let's be realistic. This is my final offer.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a chance. The value for you is dropping fast! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is dropping quickly, I need to hold my ground. Accepting $42 at this stage would be significantly less than my initial offer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to his advantage. I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next round as he sees I'm willing to play the long game."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob. Let's split this evenly. It's not worth losing any more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to acknowledge the situation's urgency.  Continuing to play hardball might result in me getting an even worse deal in the following rounds due to the accelerating inflation. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, guarantees a reasonable amount and prevents further losses."
