"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a quick negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd be getting $400,000 (80% of $500,000) and Bob would be getting $400,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing even more value due to inflation. Let's go with it.
