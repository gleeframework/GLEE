"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
