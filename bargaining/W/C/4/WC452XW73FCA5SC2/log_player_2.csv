"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share but you get something too.  Think about it, we have 12 rounds to go! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. This offer is still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 300,000$ now isn't significantly better than risking a few more rounds, especially since my share isn't being devalued."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's settle this. This offer gives us both a reasonable split, considering the time pressure."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is still fair, considering the inflation. It's time to be reasonable and reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and her offer is getting closer to a more even split. However, I believe I still have leverage. Accepting 400,000$ now isn't much better than what I might get in the next couple of rounds, especially given that Alice's position is weakening faster than mine."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply more pressure. By framing this as my ""final offer"", I'm hoping to make Alice realize we're running out of time for games. This offer is slightly more in my favor, but the shrinking pot means even Alice's reduced share is still significant. If she's rational, she'll accept."
