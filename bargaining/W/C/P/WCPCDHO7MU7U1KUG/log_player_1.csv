"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my $2,000 gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's $8,000 gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still need some to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big share, but it's the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly!

Considering the inflation effect, my $1,000 gain is worth 36.8% of what it was in the first round (64% * 56.25% = 36.8%), and Bob's $9,000 gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing!"
