"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 20, I'll take 80. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and me $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 60/40! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob 60% of the money, especially since the money is worth less for me with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous, Bob! How about 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%). I need to be careful to make the most of this opportunity.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Take 45, I'll take 55.""
}
```"
