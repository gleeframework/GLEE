"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy! I'll give you a smaller share, but not that big of a difference.""
