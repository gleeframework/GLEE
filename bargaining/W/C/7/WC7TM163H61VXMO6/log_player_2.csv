"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's a bad deal to start with such a large disparity. Let's see if we can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 50/50 is just too much of a loss for me. Let's split it 80/20, I think that's a reasonable starting point for round 3. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this deal. I need to get more than 20%, even with the inflation. Let's see if we can get closer to 50/50 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but 40/60 seems like a fair compromise.  Let's get this done.""}
