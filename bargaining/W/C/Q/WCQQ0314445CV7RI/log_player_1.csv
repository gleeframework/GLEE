"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain in Round 2 is 90% of what it was in Round 1, which is 0.9 * 900000 = 810000.

However, Bob's offer is 100000, which is 11% of the original amount, which is more than my gain in Round 1. Considering the inflation, I'll have to accept this offer to get a better deal.
