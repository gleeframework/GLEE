"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a majority of the money, as I believe it's important to secure a good portion in the first round. However, I'm also willing to offer Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept, as it's better to get something than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it is tempting to accept this offer, it's important to consider the game's dynamics.  The inflation affects Bob more than me.  If I reject, I have the chance to propose a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 80/20. This should still be a good deal for me, especially considering that I'm not subject to the same level of inflation as Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not favorable.  The inflation is impacting him heavily, and I can likely secure a better deal for myself in the next round.  I'll continue to reject offers until I can get a more substantial share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer slightly, aiming for a 70/30 split.  Bob is losing money due to inflation, so he might be more inclined to accept a slightly better offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not favorable enough for me. While I'm seeing the effects of inflation on him, it's still not enough to make his offer worth accepting. I have several rounds left, and I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer, but I'm also starting to become more flexible. The inflation is affecting Bob significantly, so I'm offering him a more substantial share this time.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to secure a deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Bob's offer is approaching a 50/50 split, it's still not in my favor. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is affecting him significantly, and I'm confident that I can take advantage of this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, and the inflation severely impacting Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable offer, and I believe it's the best way to ensure we both get something out of this.  The risk of continuing to reject offers is too high, and we may end up with nothing."
