Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still taking the majority, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  If you want to keep playing, I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to.

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round, hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the game continues. The inflation is a concern, but I believe there's still room for a better deal."
