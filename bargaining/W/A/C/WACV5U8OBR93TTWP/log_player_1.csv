I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation rate is higher for me, so I'm likely to get a worse deal if we continue."
