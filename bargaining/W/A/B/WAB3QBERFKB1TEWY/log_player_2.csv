Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to 60%, but I need a more even split.  This still accounts for the inflation difference.  Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to remember the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains with each passing round. Accepting now would mean settling for less than a fair share."
