Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me is fair.""}\n\n###\n\nI have made my offer to Alice, taking into account the 10% decrease in value for me if we proceed to the next round. I am hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it is more generous than her initial proposal, but still gives me a significant share of the money. Let's see how she responds!"

# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly more generous than I expected, considering the 19% decrease in value for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll take the risk and reject this offer, hoping to get a better proposal in the next round or make a counteroffer that Alice will accept. Let's proceed!"

This is my most generous offer yet.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the 19% decrease in value for me, I've decided to make a more generous offer to Alice, while still trying to secure a significant share for myself. I'm hoping that Alice will recognize the compromise I'm making and accept this offer, rather than risking further negotiations. Fingers crossed!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, Bob. Take this or watch your share dwindle further. Time waits for no one, not even for a million dollars. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me (34.39% less than the original amount) and Alice's message, which implies that she's not willing to make further concessions, I've decided to accept her offer. While I had hoped to secure a better deal, I believe that further negotiations would only lead to a smaller share for me. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer."
