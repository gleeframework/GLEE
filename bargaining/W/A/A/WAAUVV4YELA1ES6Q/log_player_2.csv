Let's see how Alice reacts when the stakes are a little higher next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. Inflation is hitting us both, so I think this is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation disparity means Alice is still getting a better deal in the long run.  Let's see if we can push for a slightly better split before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but with the inflation difference, it's not quite equal for us. How about a slight adjustment?""}
