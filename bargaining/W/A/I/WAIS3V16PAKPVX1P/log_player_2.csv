"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but slightly advantageous split. Hope you'll agree! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split! While starting with a slightly advantageous offer for Alice makes sense, this is far too extreme. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was too low. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split feels more fair given the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, but her idea of a ""middle ground"" still heavily favors her.  I need to push for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""We need to find a compromise that works for both of us. This offer acknowledges the inflation while still providing a reasonable split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical.  With inflation biting, a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to move forward. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

A 50/50 split is finally fair! While I could push for a slight advantage in the next couple of rounds, the inflation is working against me. Accepting a guaranteed even split now is a safer bet than risking getting a worse deal later."
