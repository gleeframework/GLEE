Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 64/36 split in your favor, Bob. This maintains some balance while accounting for the diminishing value of the money for me. Let's see if this is acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64
