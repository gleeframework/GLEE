This offer is way too low, and the game is just starting. There's a good chance I can get more by rejecting and making a counter-offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you $300000. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still not a fair share, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
