"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer. I know that the money is worth less with each round, so I'll try to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take a bit more since the value of money is decreasing with each round. Let's keep it simple, 60/40 split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more since you're trying to take advantage of the inflation. You can't have it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Although I'm losing a bit more due to inflation, it's better than getting nothing in the next round."
