"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This is a fair starting point as it allows me to get the majority of the money, but still gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although I wanted more, accepting this offer ensures I receive something.  The inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers."
