"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to be the big winner this round!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's a bit too skewed in his favor, and I think I can do better than 300,000. The game's not over yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Giving me only $100,000 is way too low, and I'm not going to let him walk all over me like this. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being stubborn!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Giving me only $200,000 is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me like this. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I'm taking the majority of the money.""
}
```

I'm being very firm this time. I'm giving Bob a very small share, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further. Let's see if he'll take it or leave it!"

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being ruthless!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Giving me only $1,000 is an insult. I'm not going to let him take the entire majority of the money. I'll keep pushing for a fair deal."

I'm being very direct this time. I'm giving Bob a tiny share, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not going to back down. Let's see if he'll finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

# Bob gain: 999500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being relentless!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather have nothing than give in to you

# Bob gain: 1 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being ridiculous!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Giving me $999,999 and keeping $1 for himself is not a real offer. I'm not going to let him try to humiliate me like this. Since this is the last round, I'm not going to get any money, and neither will Bob. It looks like we'll both be leaving empty-handed."
