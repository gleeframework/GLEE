I'm going to try and get the majority of the money, but I'm leaving some for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  Inflation is hurting me, and I'm not sure how long I can keep rejecting offers."
