"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob's gain: 5000

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair meeting in the middle and I'll get a decent amount considering the inflation.
