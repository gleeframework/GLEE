"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 10%. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll receive $100,000, but its value will be 20% less than the initial $100,000.

I'll calculate the effective value of my gain:

$100,000 x 0.8 = $80,000

So, the effective value of my gain is $80,000. In contrast, Bob would receive $900,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less in each round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is a more generous offer considering the effects of inflation."
