"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""You'll get 1 dollar, I'll get the rest. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'll be getting 99.999% of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm ready to split it evenly just yet. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer! Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 0.5,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to getting a dollar, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm still trying to get as much as possible, but I'm willing to give Bob a tiny bit to keep the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a good portion to make this worth it for me.  We're losing money with every round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob is getting a bit more realistic, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'd rather wait for an even better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999.75,
  ""bob_gain"": 0.25,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to getting a quarter, but I'm still the one calling the shots!""
}
```

I'm not giving up much, but I'm still trying to get the majority of the money!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with every round!  Let's be realistic and agree on a deal that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to give you more than a third, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob is starting to get desperate, and I'm not going to take advantage of that. His offer is a bit more reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it.
