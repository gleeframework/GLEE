"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not sure it's the best deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll get $5,000 in real value, and Bob will get $5,000 in real value as well.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, but it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
