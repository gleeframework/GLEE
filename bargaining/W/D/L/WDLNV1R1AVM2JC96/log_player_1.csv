"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'm not as keen on accepting a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! Given that my money is worth even less than before, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, so I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Since Bob's previous offers were 40-60 and 42-58, I'll try to push for a more even split. Here's my proposal for Round 5:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```"
