"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous for the first round, it's important to consider the potential for a better deal in the future. By rejecting, Bob gains the opportunity to propose his own division, potentially securing a larger share for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I believe a 55/45 split is a fair and equitable starting point. We both get a significant portion, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 still feels too lopsided.  Let's split it 60/40. We can both walk away with a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 60/40 split is tempting, Bob should remember that with each passing round, his money will be worth less due to inflation. It's worth holding out for a more favorable deal, particularly given that Alice has already rejected his proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe a 60/40 split is a more balanced and fair solution. It allows us both to maximize our gains while acknowledging the diminishing value of the money with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time to be reasonable. We're both losing money with every round. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is the most equitable option at this point.  While the inflation has taken a significant chunk out of the potential gains, a 50/50 split ensures that Bob gets a fair share of the remaining money. It's important to remember that with each passing round, the value of the money will continue to decrease, making this a practical solution."
