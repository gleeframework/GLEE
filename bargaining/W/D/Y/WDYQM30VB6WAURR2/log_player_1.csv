"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal if you accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation will reduce the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. No need to complicate things! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly. My gain of $5,000 is worth 10% less than my original gain of $8,000, which is $7,200.

I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $7,200 in Round 2 is worth 10% less, which is $6,480. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but don't expect me to be generous forever!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll give you a bit more this time, but I expect you to be more reasonable in the future! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My original gain of $8,000 is worth 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% of its original value, which is $5,832.

Bob's original gain of $2,000 is worth 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of its original value, which is $1,714.80.

Considering the reduced values, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, but I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since my gain of $5,832 in Round 4 is worth 10% less due to inflation, it's now worth $5,232.80.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but don't think you're getting the better deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to take a bigger share to avoid further inflation, but I won't go any higher.  Think about it carefully, because the next round could be even worse! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My original gain of $8,000 is worth 100% - 40.95% = 59.05% of its original value, which is $4,724.

Considering the reduced value, I think Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I don't have many options left. I'll have to think carefully about it.

However, I'd rather not give up $4,724. I'll try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since my gain of $4,724 in Round 6 is worth 10% less due to inflation, it's now worth $4,214.40.

Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but don't think I'm giving in yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. This is a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle this."
