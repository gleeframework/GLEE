"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1
I'll make the first offer. Since I want to be fair but also start with a slight advantage, I'll offer Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept to avoid further negotiations.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Fair share with a little extra for initiative""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2
Given Bob's offer, I see he's trying to assert his fairness while still taking a slight advantage for himself. However, the difference is minimal, and prolonging the game could lead to less favorable offers or a stalemate, which benefits neither of us. Thus, I'll accept his offer to ensure I get a reasonable share without risking further negotiations that might not go in my favor.
