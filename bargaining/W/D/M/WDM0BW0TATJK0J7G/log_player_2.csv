Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting hit hard by inflation, but I've also lost value, meeting you halfway between our last offers 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less your share is worth due to the 20% inflation rate.  Waiting any longer will significantly erode the value of your potential earnings. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is aware of the inflation working against you and is unlikely to agree to a drastically better deal. Her offer is already skewed in her favor, and she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a substantial risk. If you fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, you'll receive nothing. Accepting guarantees you a share, even if it's less than initially desired. 

By accepting the offer of $430,000 now, you secure a reasonable sum despite the inflation disadvantage."
