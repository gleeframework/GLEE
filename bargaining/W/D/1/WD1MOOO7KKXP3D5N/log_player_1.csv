Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer for Bob. I figure this gives me a good chance of getting the deal done quickly, and I'm hoping he'll accept before inflation has a chance to really impact the value of our money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty insulting, especially after I offered him a good deal in the first round. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I think he might be playing a game of chicken, so I need to show him I'm serious about getting this money divided."
