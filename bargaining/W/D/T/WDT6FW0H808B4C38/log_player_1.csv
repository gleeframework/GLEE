I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer, keeping in mind that Bob's money will depreciate faster. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a slightly higher share, the inflation will quickly erode the value of the money.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
