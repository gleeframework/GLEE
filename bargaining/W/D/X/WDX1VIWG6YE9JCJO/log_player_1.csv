"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the actual value of my gain in this round is $5,400.

I'm not too happy with the 60/40 split, considering the initial offer was 60/40 in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so the actual value of my gain is $4,860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```"
