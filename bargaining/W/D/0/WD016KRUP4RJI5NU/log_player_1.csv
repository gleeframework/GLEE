"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value for Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better split. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the relative value of the offer.

I'll accept the offer.
