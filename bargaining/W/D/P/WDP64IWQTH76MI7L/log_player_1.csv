Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share Alice, but time is working against me more than you.  Let's be reasonable and split the difference from your offer - we both benefit that way. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than half the value if you factor in inflation! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob is right. Factoring in inflation, his offer is more than half the original value. Rejecting it would mean risking getting even less in later rounds as the money continues to lose value, especially for Bob.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk ending up with nothing."
