"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a pretty generous offer considering Bob has no chance to make a counter-proposal in this round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While 300,000 is not a terrible amount of money, I can likely get more than that by making my own proposal in the next round. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose Alice gets $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fairer split than Bob's previous offer, and I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might offer me an even smaller amount in the next round. It's better to secure $450,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
