"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but still a bit more for me! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. Although he's increased the amount I'll get, it's still a significant disparity. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share this time!""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob getting 40%, which is $400,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to give you a good deal, but don't expect me to give you everything! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting a slightly larger share, it's still not a 50/50 split. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more for himself. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's make a fair split!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the effects of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a more balanced split."
