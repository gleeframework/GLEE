"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I need to consider the effective gain in terms of the original value. If I accept this offer, I'll get $10 in the current round, which is equivalent to $11 in the first round (10 / 0.9 = 11.11, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, I'll round down to 11). 

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal for the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we'll split the remaining $100 equally, and I'll get $50, which is a decent share considering the inflation."
