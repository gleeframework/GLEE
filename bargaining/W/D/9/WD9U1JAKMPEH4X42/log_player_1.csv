Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money.  I'm willing to give Bob a small share to hopefully incentivize him to accept, but I'm also aware that the money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, I'm aware that with each round the value of the money decreases.  Bob's offer gives me a significant share, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better deal in the next round."
