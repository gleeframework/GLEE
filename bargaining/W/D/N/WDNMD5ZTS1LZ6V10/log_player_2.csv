"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you get $40. This seems fair considering the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's play it smart! I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation on Alice's side, I might be able to get a better deal later on. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think it's only fair that I get a bit more. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. Let's see what she says!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a middle ground. $58 for me and $42 for you. The clock is ticking, and the deal is getting worse for both of us with each round. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nStill not good enough! With the inflation affecting Alice's side more and more, I'm willing to take the risk and wait for a better deal. Let's see what the next round brings!\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince Alice is under more pressure due to inflation, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time. I'll offer her 50 for me and 50 for her, but considering the current state of inflation, this might actually be more in my favor. Let's see how she reacts!\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle! 50-50 seems fair at this point, don't you think?""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's Alice's turn again!"
