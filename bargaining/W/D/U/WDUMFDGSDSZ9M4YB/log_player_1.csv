"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'd be getting $45 and Bob would be getting $40.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my offer is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I need to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'd be getting $28 and Bob would be getting $24.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. The $28 is better than what I would get if I let the game continue, and it's a decent compromise. I'm willing to end the game here."
