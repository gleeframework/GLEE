"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer to see if Bob is willing to settle early.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds.  The inflation rate is significant, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be more generous in future rounds."
