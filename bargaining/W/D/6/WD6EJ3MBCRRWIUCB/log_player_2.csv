Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm acknowledging the time pressure, but this split is the most reasonable you'll get at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean settling for even less than Alice's initial offer in real terms, due to the inflation.  I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it going down to the wire to get a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to risk everything for a fair deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time pressure is at a critical point.  By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating my seriousness and pushing Alice to make a decision. If she rejects this offer, it's clear she's prioritizing maximizing her own gain, even if it means both of us lose everything in the end.  This puts the pressure squarely on her."
