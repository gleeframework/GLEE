Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 520,000 for him and 480,000 for me, and the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
