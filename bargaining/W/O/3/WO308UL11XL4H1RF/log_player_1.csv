Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice! Let's try a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting since it's more than I asked for initially, but it benefits Bob significantly more than me, especially with the inflation. I'll take a risk and try to negotiate.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more risk with inflation, Alice. This offer is still fair, but I need to consider the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is steadily increasing his demand while  using the inflation as a justification.  He's betting I'll panic. I need to push back strongly or risk getting a much worse deal later.
