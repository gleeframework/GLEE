Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's more than what you offered me last round, even after accounting for inflation.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince I've accepted the offer, the game is now over. I'll summarize the outcome:\n\n* Bob's gain: 4500 (which is worth 65.61% of its original value due to inflation)\n* Alice's gain: 5500 (which is worth 81.45% of its original value due to inflation)\n\nIt was a fun game! I tried to balance my proposals between being fair and considering the impact of inflation on my gains. In the end, I decided to accept Alice's final offer, which seemed reasonable given the circumstances. Thanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again or try a different game, just let me know!"
