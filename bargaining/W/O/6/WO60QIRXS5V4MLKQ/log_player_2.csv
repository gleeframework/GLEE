Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time pressure is on me, not you. I'll give a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the time pressure more than Bob due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer is slightly better, it's likely she will be forced to make a much better offer soon to avoid walking away with nothing. Bob is in a strong negotiating position."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Let's settle this now.  This offer is fair and avoids us both losing out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the heat of the inflation.  While Bob could push for an even larger share, there's a risk Alice becomes too desperate and offers increasingly smaller amounts. This offer represents a good balance of maximizing Bob's gains while increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting before time runs out."
