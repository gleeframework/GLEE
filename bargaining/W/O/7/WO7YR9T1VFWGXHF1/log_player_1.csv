"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split,  Alice.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd rather aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I'll get a 54-46 split, which is a bit more in my favor. What do you think, Bob?"
