"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous split.  I'm willing to give you 10% of the money. We have plenty of time to negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense of starting the negotiation, it's incredibly unfavorable to Bob. There are many more rounds to go, and the value of the money is going to decrease dramatically for Bob with each passing round. It's worth risking the next round to see if Alice is willing to offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in your favor, but we need to move quickly. The money is losing value for me with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to make a deal soon. Time is not on our side. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the first round, the money is depreciating rapidly for Bob.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge further, even with the time pressure. There are still many rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to split the money 55/45 in your favor, but the clock is ticking. If we don't agree, we risk getting nothing.""}
