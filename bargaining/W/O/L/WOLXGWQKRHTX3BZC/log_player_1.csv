"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the money depreciates, we both still get a good amount.  Let's be reasonable and end this early. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
