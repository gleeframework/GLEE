"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can discuss further if you want, but this feels like a good starting point.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the time value of money, as the later rounds diminish my potential gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the time value of money, but your 60/40 proposal is still too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to budge a bit, but let's split it 55/45. This way we both get a decent share, and we avoid further rounds with diminishing returns. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
