Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer significantly undervalues my position given the faster rate of inflation I experience. This offer is a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation difference to her advantage. While her offer is closer to the middle, it still disproportionately favors her. Rejecting keeps the pressure on and gives me another opportunity to propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair resolution. This offer factors in the inflation disparity while still providing a reasonable share for both of us. Accepting now ensures we both walk away with a decent amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is strategically positioned:

* **Acknowledges Inflation:** It provides a larger share for me (Bob) than Alice, reflecting the faster devaluation of her potential gains. 
* **Appeals to Reason:**  By stating I'm ""aiming for a fair resolution"", it subtly pressures Alice to accept a deal that's already tilted in her favor considering the inflation rates.
* **Time Pressure:** Delaying further significantly erodes Alice's potential gains, making this offer increasingly attractive compared to the risk of future rounds."
