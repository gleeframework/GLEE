"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. It's a good starting point!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob 20% of the initial $100, and I get 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth 20% less than $40, which is $32.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. 50/50 seems fair, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.""
}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which might be a more reasonable compromise."
