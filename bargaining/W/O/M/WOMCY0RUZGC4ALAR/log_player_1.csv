"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty straightforward offer. I'll take $900,000, and Bob gets $100,000. It seems fair to me, but I'm curious to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, I'm still better off waiting and making a counter-offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal than 200,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to go for a slightly lower offer than the first round. Even with the inflation, I think 800,000 is a good deal for me, and Bob should be willing to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Inflation is hitting hard, but I can still get a better deal than 400,000.  I'm going to hold out for another round and see if I can get closer to my original goal of 800,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not by much.  Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has taken a big bite out of the value of the money, I'm going to accept this offer. I'm getting a decent amount, and it's better than risking another round and potentially getting even less.  I've learned that Bob is willing to play hardball, and I'm not willing to risk it further."
