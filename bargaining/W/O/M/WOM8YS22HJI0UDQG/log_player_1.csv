"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so Bob's offer of 50 dollars is actually a smaller amount than it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like we're splitting the money 50/50, which is a pretty even split, but I was hoping for a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially losing more value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
