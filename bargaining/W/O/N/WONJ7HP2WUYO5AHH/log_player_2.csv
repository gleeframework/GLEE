Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was already generous. I'm willing to compromise further with $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a fair deal considering the inflation is hurting you more than me. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
