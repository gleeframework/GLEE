Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. It's a good starting point, and I want to see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, and while I would have preferred my initial offer, I'm not confident I can get a better deal.  The risk of further inflation and getting nothing at all isn't worth it."
