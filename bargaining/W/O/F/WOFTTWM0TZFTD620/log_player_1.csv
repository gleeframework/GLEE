"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really hungry for cash! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting! 

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the significant difference in our gains. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
