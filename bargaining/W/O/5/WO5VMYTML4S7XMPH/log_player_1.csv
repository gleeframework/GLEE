"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid a long negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fairer split. Accept it and let's end this already. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being fair, but I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 90% in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a more reasonable split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It's still more for me than yours, but it's the best I can do with the decreasing value of my share. Accept it and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept an offer that's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the value of his share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll wait for a more even split.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger. I want a bigger share before it's too late.""
}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to fall for Bob's ""last chance"" trick. I've rejected his previous offers, and I'll reject this one too. I'm holding out for a better deal.

Round 7
