"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share of the money, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept it early on. It also ensures that Bob gets something, potentially making him less likely to reject the offer and risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The offer is significantly worse for Alice than the previous round, even considering inflation. 
* **Fairness:** The offer is drastically skewed in favor of Bob.
* **Future Rounds:**  Alice still has 10 rounds remaining to try and get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Alice to make a counter-proposal in the next round and potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** This is a counter-offer to Bob's proposal. Alice is willing to give up some of her previous share, but still maintains a majority.
* **Fairness:**  While still favoring Alice, this offer is less skewed than Bob's previous proposal. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Alice is trying to avoid the risk of further inflation by making a reasonable offer to incentivize Bob to accept before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The offer is considerably worse for Alice than the previous round due to inflation.
* **Unfairness:**  While Bob is offering Alice a larger share than the previous round, it is still significantly less than what she would have received if she had accepted her own offer in round 3. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** With 8 rounds remaining, there is still time for Alice to make a counter-offer or wait for a better proposal from Bob. Rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a more favorable outcome open."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is now worth significantly less than in the first round. Alice needs to find a balance between securing a decent share and being willing to compromise.
* **Counter-Offer:** This is a counter-offer to Bob's proposal in round 4. Alice is willing to give up some of her previous share, but still maintains a majority.
* **Incentivize Acceptance:**  By offering a larger share than Bob in round 4, Alice might be able to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While there is still a chance Bob will reject this offer, the risk of further inflation is increasing with each passing round. This offer is a reasonable balance between securing a share and mitigating the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is now worth significantly less than in the first round, and the value continues to drop rapidly.
* **Fairness:** This offer is the most fair and equitable we've seen so far, with an equal share for both players. 
* **Risk of Further Loss:**  Rejecting this offer carries a substantial risk of losing a significant portion of the remaining value due to inflation. Accepting ensures Alice receives a reasonable amount, considering the rapidly declining value. 
* **Limited Time:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the time for negotiation is limited. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable outcome before the situation worsens further due to inflation."
