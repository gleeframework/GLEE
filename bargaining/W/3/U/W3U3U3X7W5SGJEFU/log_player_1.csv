"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is very fair. I was willing to split it 50/50 in the first round, and now he's trying to take a 3/5 share? That's not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still somewhat favorable to me, given the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a middle ground, a bit more than my previous offer 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal after rejecting his previous offers. This new offer is still not 50/50, and I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, let's finalize the deal""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is closer to 50/50 and takes into account the effects of inflation. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob and we can finally settle on a division."
