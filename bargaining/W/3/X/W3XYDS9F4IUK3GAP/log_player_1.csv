"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking 600,000 and Bob taking 400,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'm not thrilled with the 75-25 split, but I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
