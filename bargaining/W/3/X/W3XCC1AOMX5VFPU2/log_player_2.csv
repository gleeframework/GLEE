Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the money is worth less to her.  While her offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, I'm aiming to secure at least $6000. I believe there's a good chance she'll crack under the pressure of inflation soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split.  Take it or leave it - time is running out for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with the $6000/$4000 split. It's becoming clear that Alice is willing to accept less than her initial offer, but she's still trying to hold out for more than half.  With the added pressure of the limited rounds and the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gains, this firm offer might be enough to get her to concede."
