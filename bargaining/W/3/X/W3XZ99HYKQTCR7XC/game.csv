60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I get 60 and you get 40. It's better to take this deal now, before inflation eats away at our potential earnings.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, considering inflation affects you more than me. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting me more each round. I'll take my previous offer of 55. Take it before it shrinks further!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I see you're feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not budging much. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? It's still a relatively fair deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating my share alive! I'm dropping my offer to 52.  Take it or leave it - another round will just hurt us both.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,I think we've reached the point where my patience is worth more than your losses to inflation. I'll take 60 and you can have 40. It's still better than waiting another round.,Bob,6,
