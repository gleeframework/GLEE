"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully we can come to a more equitable solution later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit risky to accept such a lopsided offer so early on. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later on, especially as the value of the money decreases for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this round. We can work out a more nuanced split later, but it's important to show we can cooperate.""}
