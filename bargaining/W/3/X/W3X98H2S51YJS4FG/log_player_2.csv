Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, don't you?""}\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe offer isn't good enough for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice, it's time to be realistic about the value of this money. Inflation is eating away at it!""}\n\nMaybe this offer will be more to Alice's liking."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's just split it evenly and stop this back and forth. We can both get something instead of nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, accepting the offer to split the money evenly seems like the best course of action. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, likely resulting in a worse outcome for both of us."
