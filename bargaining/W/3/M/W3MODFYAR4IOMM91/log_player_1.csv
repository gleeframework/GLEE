Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the first offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split in this round is the best strategy.  The inflation rate means that if I reject this offer, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
