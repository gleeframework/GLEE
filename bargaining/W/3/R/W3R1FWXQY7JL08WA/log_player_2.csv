"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than a 30% share. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage leaves too much value on the table for Alice. The inflation factor is increasingly hurting me, but I still have some leverage.  I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
