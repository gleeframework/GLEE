"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, with the message that I'm starting with a fair and generous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic. I'll take 95% and you get 5%.  It's a better deal than losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me! Due to inflation, the $50,000 I'd get is now worth only 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $45,000 in today's money.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You took it too far last round, let's find a middle ground""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself, with the message that I'm looking for a more balanced deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly.  We're both losing money with each round, so I'm willing to give you 40%.  Accept this and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision! Due to inflation, the $400,000 I'd get is now worth only 73.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $293,600 in today's money.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I think I'll take it. It's not a great deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
