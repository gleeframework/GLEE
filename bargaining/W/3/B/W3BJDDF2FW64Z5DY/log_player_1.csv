"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $50, which is worth 80% of the original $60 I was offered in Round 1. This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
