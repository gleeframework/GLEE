"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, I need to think carefully about Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth significantly less for Bob, I'm not sure if he's being generous enough. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```

I'm adjusting the split slightly more in my favor, considering the increasing inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation rate is getting crazy!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of Bob's share, I think I should take the deal. 75 is a good chunk of the original 100, and it's better than risking going to round 7 with an even lower value for both of us.
