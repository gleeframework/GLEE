Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. It's tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.  I know Bob is losing more money with inflation, so he might be willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a more equitable split this time. Since we have many rounds left, a fair offer could be more appealing to Bob, especially as his money loses value each round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
