Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get the game started quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still trying to conserve some for myself! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 60 is now worth 48.

I'm not too thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.
