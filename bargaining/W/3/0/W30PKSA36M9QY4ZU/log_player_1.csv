"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. Given the impact of inflation, where the value decreases by 20% for me and 10% for Bob with each passing round, I aim to negotiate a slightly higher share to compensate for the higher depreciation on my end. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" is intended to convey a sense of fairness while also acknowledging the different rates at which our shares will depreciate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer. We both get a good chunk, and it avoids the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fact that my share depreciates faster, accepting $450,000 in the second round means I'd actually be getting significantly less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round. Considering this, and aiming for a more equitable division over time, I'll reject this offer and proceed to make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better share that compensates for the higher depreciation rate on my end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that slightly adjusts the amounts from the first round, taking into account the depreciation of the money's value. Given that my share loses value at a rate of 20% per round and Bob's at 10%, I've aimed to find a balance that would be more equitable considering these factors. The message ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer"" is meant to convey that this proposal accounts for the different impacts of inflation on our shares, aiming for a fairer division in light of these conditions."
