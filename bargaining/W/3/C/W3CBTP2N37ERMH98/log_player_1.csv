"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80-20. I'll get the majority, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but I'm offering Bob a decent chunk to make the game more interesting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want to keep the majority for now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer seems a bit too generous, considering he's keeping the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I'm still aiming for a fair split. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to find a balance that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, but I want to get closer to the majority. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my share is now extremely small. However, I don't want to give up yet.

Considering the significant difference in our shares, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Bob is offering me a very small share, but I'm not sure if I should accept it and risk getting even less in future rounds.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority of the money, but I'm not giving up yet. Meet me halfway, and let's finish this.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob the majority of the money, but I'm still holding out for a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value! With my share being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering the extremely small share I'd get from this offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth continuing the game. However, I still don't want to give up yet.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options. This is my last stand. I'll give you most of the money, but I need something for myself.""
}
```

This is a very small share for me, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm desperate and will accept this offer to end the game."
