"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'm willing to give you 10% of the money.  We can negotiate from there. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way to divide the remaining money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome considering the ongoing inflation.  I'm not confident that I can secure a better deal with further rounds."
