``` 
Let's see what Alice's next proposal looks like!  I'm not sure I want to accept a deal where she gets 1000 more than me.  There's a good chance I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's demands are getting out of hand! I'm not going to accept a deal where I get 2000 less than her, even if inflation is hitting her harder. I'm sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
