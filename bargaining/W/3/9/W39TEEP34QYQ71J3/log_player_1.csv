"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing a friendly message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want 60. It's a good starting point for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 40 dollars, which is 40% of the original 100 dollars.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give Bob 60 dollars, which is 60% of the original 100 dollars. That seems like a pretty high percentage, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with it.

I'll reject the offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is a slight adjustment in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. 55 for me, 45 for you. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30. I think I'm getting closer to a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 30 dollars, which is 30% of the original 100 dollars.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so he's actually getting 70 dollars, but it's equivalent to 59.85% of the original 100 dollars.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving Bob such a large percentage of the original amount. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's 70/30 proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! 45 for me, 55 for you. Take it or leave it!""
}
