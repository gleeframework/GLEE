I'll propose a split of $90 for me and $10 for Bob.  It's a pretty fair split, but I'm taking advantage of the fact that we can negotiate further. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer! It's my turn to make a proposal, and I will try to get a better split than 10/90."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  The money is worth less now, and I want to ensure we both get a decent share.  Hopefully, Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
