I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good deal early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the remaining value, which is better than risking a complete loss in the later rounds."
