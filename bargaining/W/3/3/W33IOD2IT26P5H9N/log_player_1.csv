"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives Alice a larger share, as she knows that the money will be worth less for Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a good deal for Alice, considering the inflation.  Even with the 10% loss in value, she is still getting $4,000, which is better than risking a further decrease in the next round."
