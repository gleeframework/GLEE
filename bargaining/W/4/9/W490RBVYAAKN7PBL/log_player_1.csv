"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer is designed to be fair, as it gives Alice a large portion of the money, but it's also strategic as it leaves a small amount for Bob, which might encourage him to accept in the first round to avoid potential inflation."
