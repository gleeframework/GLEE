"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving $100,000 to Bob. This is a good starting point, as it offers a significant advantage to me while still giving Bob a reasonable amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 200,000$ gain is tempting, it's significantly less than my initial offer, and I'm still in a position to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split, keeping $500,000 for myself and giving $500,000 to Bob.  This is a fair and balanced offer, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, and a 50/50 split ensures that we both maximize our potential gains.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I am losing out on a significant portion of the money due to inflation, accepting this offer would leave me with a much smaller share than I initially proposed.  I will reject this offer and see what Bob's next proposal will be, hoping for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, keeping $600,000 for myself and giving $400,000 to Bob. I am willing to compromise further, but I believe this offer still reflects the value of my initial proposal and accounts for the inflation that has occurred. I am hopeful that Bob will see the benefit of accepting this offer and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially proposed, with each passing round, the value of the money decreases substantially.  Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me a sizable portion of the money, and further rounds of negotiation are likely to result in even lower gains due to inflation.  It's time to accept and secure what I can."
