"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

With inflation, my gain of 2000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk going into another round, so I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
