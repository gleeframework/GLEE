"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get more for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me and 10% less for Bob (5% in the first round, 5% in the second round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I think I deserve more. Meet me in the middle, but not quite.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500 and keeping $7,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. $6,000 is a good compromise, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing more money in future rounds."
