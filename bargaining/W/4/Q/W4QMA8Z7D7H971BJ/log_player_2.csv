Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one! Alice is being stubborn, and the pressure is on. However, accepting 250,000 at this stage would be significantly less than what I could have gotten earlier. There's still a chance Alice will make a better offer in the next few rounds, especially as she sees the deadline approaching."

# Alice's message: This is my last offer, Bob. It's more than fair considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a difficult decision, but the time pressure is immense now. While I could reject and hope for a better offer in the remaining rounds, there's a significant risk of getting even less or nothing at all if Alice stays firm. Accepting 300,000 now, while far from ideal, still guarantees a decent sum."
