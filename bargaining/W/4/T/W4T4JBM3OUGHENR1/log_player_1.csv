"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and simple way to divide the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, but I'm willing to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $30 I gain in this round is worth less than the $50 I would have gained in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.
