"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the effective value of the offer is:

Alice gain: 7000 * 0.8 = 5600
Bob gain: 3000 * 0.95 = 2850

I'll decide to reject this offer. My goal is to maximize my gain, and I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
