"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40. We can discuss further if you'd like to change.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in favor of me, Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in Round 2 would be:

* My gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27
* Bob's gain: 70 * 0.8 = 56

I'm not too thrilled about the 56-27 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
