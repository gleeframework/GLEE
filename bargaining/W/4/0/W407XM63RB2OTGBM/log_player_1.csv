I'm going to propose a split of $9,000 for myself and $1,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the lion's share but I'm also giving him something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hurting me and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
