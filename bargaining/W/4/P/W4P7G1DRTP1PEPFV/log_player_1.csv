"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Take the low offer, it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. With the money worth 10% less, I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split."

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to get a bit more of the pie while still being reasonable."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 55/45 split, and the fact that the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round makes it even harder to swallow. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal."

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise again""}
