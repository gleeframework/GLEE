I'm going to try and get the most I can, but I want to be fair. I'm offering Bob $1.  He might accept it, or he might try to get more in the next round.  We'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that offer. It's extremely unfair! I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution.  I'm hoping Bob will see that too!"
