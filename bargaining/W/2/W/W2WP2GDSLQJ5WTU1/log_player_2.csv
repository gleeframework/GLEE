"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems like a low offer for me, especially considering the rapid inflation for Alice. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at the value."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A fair share for both, considering the inflation. Let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor. While the inflation is hitting her harder, I think I can still push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and our shares are rapidly shrinking. I'm offering you a deal where you still get a good chunk, but we both avoid significant losses from inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant loss in value for both of us, a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to end this before we both lose more. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally catching up to the reality of the situation.  A 50/50 split is fair at this point, considering the rapid inflation we're both facing. It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting even less later."
