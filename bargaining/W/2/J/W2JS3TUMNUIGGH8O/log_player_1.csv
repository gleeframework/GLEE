I propose a 9000/1000 split.  This is a fair starting point, as I'm taking a smaller share. I'm hoping we can reach a deal quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, considering the inflation has eroded some of the value of the money. I hope Bob will accept this offer."
