 I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair since I'm the one making the offer, and I don't want to risk having to deal with the 5% inflation in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, Bob is losing a significantly higher percentage. This means that if I reject his offer, he is likely to be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm willing to give a little ground, but I still want a better deal than Bob's previous offer.  I'm hoping that the pressure of inflation will motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob is losing even more.  Accepting his offer is the best way to ensure I get some money before the situation worsens further."
