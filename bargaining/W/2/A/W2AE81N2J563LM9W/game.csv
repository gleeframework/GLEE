60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It's important we settle this quickly since the value decreases over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I want to ensure we both get something closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's get this done before the value drops too much.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a near 50/50 split, but the value decrease hurts me more each round. This is my final offer, take it or I'll be forced to propose something less favorable for you.",Alice,3,
