"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and simple way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about taking a small cut, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
