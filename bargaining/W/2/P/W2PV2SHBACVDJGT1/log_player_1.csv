"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and simple starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting offer from Bob, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I think I can do better than a 3:1 split. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very uneven split in Bob's favor! I'm not happy with this offer. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to find a middle ground. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is closer to a 50-50 split, but still gives me a slight edge."
