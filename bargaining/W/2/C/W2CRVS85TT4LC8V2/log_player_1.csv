Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3800 in real value.

I'll reject this offer.
