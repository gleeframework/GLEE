"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm not sure how the inflation will affect the value of the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 501000 
# Bob gain: 499000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll take it. The inflation is eating into my potential gains, so I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk losing more value in future rounds.
