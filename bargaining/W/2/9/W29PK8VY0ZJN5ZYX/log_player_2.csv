"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment in your last offer. This is a compromise that still acknowledges the decreasing value of the pot for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, which is good. However, she's still heavily advantaged by the inflation mechanism.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal."
