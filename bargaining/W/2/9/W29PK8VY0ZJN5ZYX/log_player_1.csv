Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aiming for a solution that benefits us both. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob, making him more likely to accept a deal that's less advantageous as rounds progress. We're leveraging this pressure.
* **Time Pressure:** We are approaching the halfway point of the game, and the risk of getting nothing increases with each passing round.
* **Decent Offer:** While not as high as our previous offer, $550,000 is a significant amount and better than risking a worse outcome later."
