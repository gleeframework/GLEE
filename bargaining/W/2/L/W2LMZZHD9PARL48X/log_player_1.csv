# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate due to the inflation working against him, but I'm not feeling the pressure yet. He's trying to inch closer to his original offer, but I'll hold out for a slightly better deal.  There's still time."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but we need to act fast. This offer is the best I can do given the time and inflation. Let's make a deal before we lose everything! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting really anxious now, his offer is even worse than before. This indicates that he's feeling the pressure of inflation. It's a clear signal that I have some leverage, and I should hold out for a better deal."

{
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""bob_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm throwing you a lifeline here. This is practically an even split considering how much inflation is working against you. Take the deal! We both win!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Time to turn up the pressure and highlight the cost of delay for Bob.  This offer is still in my favor, but it's very reasonable given the circumstances and should entice him to settle before he loses even more."
