Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob responds.  I want to get a sense of whether he's willing to compromise or if he's going to play a more aggressive game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a clear sign he's aiming for a much larger share of the money.  He's also willing to play hardball. I'm going to reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round, aiming for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a more even split, aiming for 60% of the money. While Bob's initial offer was unreasonable, I don't want to continue pushing for a larger share and risk losing everything. It's time to find some middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly playing a game of attrition, pushing me further and further towards his desired split. However, while the inflation is hurting, it's not enough for me to accept such an unfair offer yet. I will reject and propose my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is starting to take a toll, but I'm still not convinced that accepting Bob's offer is the best option.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is the most equitable solution, and if Bob is truly interested in reaching an agreement, he should accept it."
