"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but it's also fair to Bob as he still gets a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation could significantly impact him in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfavorable to me, and while I don't know how inflation is affecting him, I know that it is hurting me. I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm taking a larger share this time. I'm hoping that the inflation will make this offer more appealing to him than the last one, and that he'll realize he's better off accepting now than risking a worse deal in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a significant amount, inflation has hit me hard. I know that the longer this game goes on, the less my money will be worth. I need to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm taking a larger share this time. I'm hoping that the inflation will make this offer more appealing to him than the last one, and that he'll realize he's better off accepting now than risking a worse deal in the future rounds. I'm also hoping that this offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise, and that he'll be more open to negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not favorable to me, and inflation has significantly affected my gains. I need to try and get a better deal in the next round. While I don't know how much inflation is affecting Bob, I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Inflation has hit me hard, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm offering Bob an even split this time, hoping that he'll realize that it's better for us both to settle now than to risk a worse outcome in the future.  This offer is my last attempt to negotiate before I'm forced to accept a worse deal."
