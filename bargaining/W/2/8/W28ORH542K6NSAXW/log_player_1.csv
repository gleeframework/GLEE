Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I won't go lower than this. We both need to be satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round due to inflation.  While he thinks he's getting $600,000, it's worth significantly less.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means going to the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. My final offer. Take it, or the inflation will eat away even more of your share. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk.  Bob's share is worth even less now. While I'd prefer a larger share, I need to offer him something that seems reasonable before his share dwindles to the point where he'll accept anything. This offer gives me a clear advantage while still giving him something worthwhile."
