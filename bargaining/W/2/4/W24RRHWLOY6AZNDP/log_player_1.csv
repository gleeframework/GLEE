"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll make a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain would be $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000. Since Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in the first round, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than the original $1,000,000, my gain would be $450,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.271) = $326,715. My gain is worth 32.67% of the original $1,000,000. I'll accept this offer.
