"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting a slight edge, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit aggressive, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the aggressive offer from Bob in the previous round, I'll make a more cautious proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a more neutral proposal, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
