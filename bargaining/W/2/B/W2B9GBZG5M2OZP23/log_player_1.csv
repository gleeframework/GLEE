Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a decent share, and I won't have to worry about the money devaluing further. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
