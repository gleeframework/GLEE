75.0,25.0,Let's split it 75/25. I think it's fair considering the decreasing value of money.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"I'll take a smaller share now to have a better chance of getting more in future rounds, but I still think 80/20 is a fair start.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose we split it 45/55. This maintains a reasonable difference while acknowledging the diminishing value of money.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
15.0,85.0,"I'm still holding out for a better deal. 85/15 is a more substantial difference, considering the inflation is affecting your share more significantly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,I understand Bob's perspective. Let's try a compromise with a 30/70 split. This maintains a significant difference for both of us while acknowledging the inflationary impact on my share.,Alice,5,
