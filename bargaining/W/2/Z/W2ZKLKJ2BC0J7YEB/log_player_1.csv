"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This leaves me with the vast majority of the money, and avoids the risk of inflation eating into my share in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the safest option.  Bob's offer is fair, and if I reject it, there's a risk that inflation will further reduce my share in the future. It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 now."
