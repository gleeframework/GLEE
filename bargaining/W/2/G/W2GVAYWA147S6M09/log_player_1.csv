I'm going to propose a very uneven split in my favor.  I figure that since I get to go first, I might as well try to get the lion's share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to take the crumbs!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less, I'll accept this offer. It's a much fairer split, and it's better than getting nothing in the next round if I keep rejecting."
