"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than equal share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a fair one""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a lopsided deal! I'm not comfortable with a 30/70 split, especially since I was willing to give him a 45/55 split earlier. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I need to make another counteroffer to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fairer split""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offers, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
