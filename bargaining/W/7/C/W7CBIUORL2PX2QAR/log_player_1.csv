# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90 and you can have 10. I believe in a fair split, even if you don't seem to. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 80/20, with me getting the larger share. It's a fairer split than your previous offer, and we can end this game quickly.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you seem to prefer a more uneven split, I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor.  Let's finish this quickly. It's not fair to both of us to keep going with inflation affecting our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95

``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further inflation and ensure I receive at least some money."
