"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the original $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now, so the actual amounts are $48 for me and $32 for Bob.

I accept this offer.
