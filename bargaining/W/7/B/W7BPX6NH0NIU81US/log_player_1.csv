I'm starting with a strong offer for myself, aiming to get the majority of the money. I'll see if Bob accepts, but I'm prepared for him to counter-propose in the next round. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer more money, I'm losing 10% of my gain each round and I don't know how much Bob is losing. This seems like a fair split, and it avoids the risk of further inflation."
