"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both get a good amount of money.  This is a better deal than waiting for the next round, where the money will be worth less for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
