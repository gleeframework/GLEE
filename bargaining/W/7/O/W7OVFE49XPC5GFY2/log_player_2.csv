Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a final offer. I'm taking a smaller cut to get this settled.  The longer we wait, the less we both get! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, I have to stand my ground.  A deal this lopsided isn't fair."
