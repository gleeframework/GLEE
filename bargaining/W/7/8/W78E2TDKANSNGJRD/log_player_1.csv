I propose to take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider, and I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as Round 1, but I'll adjust the amount to reflect the inflation.  I'll take $8000 and leave $2000 for Bob.  This gives me a good amount, while still leaving him with something to consider."
