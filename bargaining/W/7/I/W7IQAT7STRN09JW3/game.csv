60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a good amount.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we do 55/45? It's closer to a fair split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I understand you want a more even split. How about 58/42? It's a compromise, and we need to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I see you're willing to compromise, but 58/42 is still not fair. How about we meet in the middle at 52/48?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the deal is getting worse for me with every round.  55/45 is my final offer. Let's settle this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
49.0,51.0,"You said 55/45 is your final offer, but I'm not convinced. Since the deal is getting worse for you, I'll make a small concession. How about 51/49?",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit with the inflation, and you're just chipping away. 53/47 is my absolute last offer.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
50.0,50.0,"I understand you're frustrated, but I've been consistent in seeking a fair split. Since you're taking a hit from inflation, I'll meet you exactly in the middle: 50/50. This is a fair deal.",Bob,8,
