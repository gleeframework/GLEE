Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal. The clock is ticking, let's be smart and take what's on the table. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

**Reasoning:** Alice is consistently offering deals that heavily favor her. While the value of the money is decreasing for me, I still have some leverage. Accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half, even after accounting for inflation. I'm hoping she'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. It's clear you're not negotiating in good faith. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic, but she's also running a risk by dragging this out. Offering a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical move. It's fair, it prevents me from losing more to inflation, and it puts the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal. If she rejects this, I'm prepared to play hardball in the remaining rounds, even if it means risking getting nothing."
