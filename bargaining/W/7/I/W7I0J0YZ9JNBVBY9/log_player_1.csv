Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out and inflation is eating our money. I'm offering a 60/40 split. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still heavily skewed in his favor. The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts him, making him more likely to accept a fairer deal.  I'm willing to push him a bit further."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. It's clear you're not negotiating in good faith. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally come down to a reasonable 50/50 split.  While I might have been able to push for slightly more in earlier rounds, the inflation is working against me. It's better to accept a fair deal now than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
