"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""This proposal aims to divide the money with a significant gap. I propose you receive 25$, while I take 75$. Please consider if this is acceptable.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money equally, each receiving $50. It's fair and ensures neither of us ends up with significantly more or less than the other. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
