"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is 50% each, which is a fair split, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer for now and wait for a better one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more, but not too greedy, since the money is worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less now. Bob's offer is still 40% for me, which is a decent offer considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
