"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight bias in my favor. Since Bob's money loses value over time, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept a decent offer early on rather than risking further devaluation. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and reason, making him more likely to accept the proposal.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please relay his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I want half 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the offer is exactly half and half, I need to consider the impact of inflation on Bob's future gains. Given that his money loses value over time, I might be able to negotiate a better deal if I reject this offer. However, I also risk ending up with less if Bob decides to lower his offer in the next round.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease relay my response to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of Bob's decreasing value of money. Since he's already lost 5% of the value in the previous round and will lose another 5% in this round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nI'm trying to appeal to Bob's rational side by mentioning inflation, making him aware that his money is losing value over time. This might motivate him to accept my offer rather than risking further devaluation.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer of 48 for me and 52 for him, I need to reassess the situation. Given that his money has lost 14.26% of its value compared to the first round, his actual gain is equivalent to around 44.55 in the initial round's value. Meanwhile, my gain of 48 remains unaffected by inflation.\n\nIn this context, the offer seems relatively balanced, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gains. I might not be able to negotiate a significantly better deal in the next round, and there's a risk that Bob could lower his offer further.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I'll decide to accept this offer, as it appears to be a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer."
