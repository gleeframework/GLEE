"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That seems a bit imbalanced, Alice. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in your favor? It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
