I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get this settled quickly. 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm getting less in this round due to inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  It's my turn to propose now, and I'll take advantage of the inflation hitting Bob harder than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
```

I'm going to take advantage of the inflation hitting Bob harder. This offer is still pretty generous, but I'm going to try to get closer to a 70/30 split for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  I'm getting a lot less due to inflation, but Bob's offer is too lopsided. Even though inflation is hitting me harder, I'm confident I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I'm going to try a more aggressive offer this time. I know inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm going to see if I can get a split closer to 60/40. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that's too unfavorable."
