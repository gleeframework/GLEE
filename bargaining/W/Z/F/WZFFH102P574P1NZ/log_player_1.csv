"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is proposing a 75/25 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $8,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
