```

I'm going to stick with my initial offer. I believe that Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse due to the inflation effect, and I still have a strong chance of securing a better deal than what he is currently offering.

It's better to take what I can get at this point.  Bob's offers have been declining, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the final round. It's getting risky, and I'm not willing to gamble with the chance of losing everything.  I'll accept this offer and walk away with $50."
