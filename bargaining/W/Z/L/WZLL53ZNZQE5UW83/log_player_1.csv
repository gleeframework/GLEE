Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the growing inflation gap, I think this split is getting more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation disparity, but his offer is still not advantageous enough for me. While the longer the game goes on the worse it gets for me, accepting a bad deal now is worse than potentially getting a better deal later.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even considering the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm still offering you a fair deal. 5200 for me, 4800 for you. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting the larger share. The inflation is working against me, but I need to find a balance between getting a decent deal and not letting this drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we acknowledge the significant impact of inflation on your share. This split reflects that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is now equal to my initial offer to him, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round. However, accepting 4000 now means losing out on almost half the initial value due to inflation. 

I need to gamble that Bob understands we both lose if the game goes to round 12. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer, hoping he'll be more amenable to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, you've made your point about the inflation. This is my final offer: 4800 for me, 5200 for you.  Let's close this out and get something, or we both walk away with nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. The inflation is severely impacting my potential gains, and Bob knows it.  I need to signal I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not completely cave to his demands. Offering him slightly more than me, but a significant improvement from his last offer, might be the push he needs to accept.  This is a calculated risk, as he might hold out for even more, but the alternative of reaching round 12 is worse for both of us."
