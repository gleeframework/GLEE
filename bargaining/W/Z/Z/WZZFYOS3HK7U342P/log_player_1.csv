Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be fair. This split accounts for the time value of money.  We can avoid further inflation by settling now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
