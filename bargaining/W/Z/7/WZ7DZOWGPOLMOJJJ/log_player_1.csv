I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly.  I figure Bob might be tempted to take it and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I won't accept this offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm still keeping a good chunk of the money. The inflation is starting to bite, so I want to secure something before it gets worse."
