"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Since this is the first round, the money still holds its full value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a classic example of ""tit for tat"".  While I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, accepting this offer would set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the game. I need to show Bob that I'm not going to be bullied into accepting unfair deals.  By rejecting, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to fight for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is still a substantial gain for him, especially considering the inflation we're facing. I'm hoping this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is clearly playing a game of brinkmanship, and he's starting to gain an advantage with the escalating inflation. While his offer represents a significant drop in value for me due to inflation, accepting would set a dangerous precedent. I need to stand firm and demonstrate that I won't be swayed by his pressure tactics. Rejecting this offer sends a message that I am willing to risk more rounds to achieve a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're both losing money due to inflation, and this situation isn't sustainable. I'm offering a 50/50 split to try and break the stalemate. This is the fairest solution considering the current circumstances, and I hope Bob recognizes the need for compromise."
