"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the money, but still a significant amount. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not thrilled about accepting such a small consolation prize. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a fair balance between our gains. The message is a gentle warning that I won't be pushed around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about accepting this offer. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even smaller share. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round.
