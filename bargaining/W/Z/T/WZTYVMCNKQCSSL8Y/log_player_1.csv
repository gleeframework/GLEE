"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start with, which seems like a fair and reasonable way to begin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I'm not sure how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the money, I'll take a chance.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
