{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share, but it's a good start for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
