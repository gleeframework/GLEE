"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share, or if he'll gamble on getting more in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting ensures we both get a decent share of the money."
