"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better deal last round, now I'm taking a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'm looking at a gain of 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 50/50. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of 3000 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277) = 2171.

This offer is not acceptable to me. I think I can do better than this, and I'm not getting desperate yet.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for a higher gain. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet. I think I deserve a better share, but I'm willing to compromise. What's your best offer?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now. My gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of 2000 * 0.592 (1 - 0.4075) = 1184.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 50/50 and the previous offers. I'll reject this offer.
