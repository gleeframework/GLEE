"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. With the new values, I'll get $4000 and Bob will get $6000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer that gives me a better share of the pie.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a fair share""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the new values, I'll get $3500 and Bob will get $6500. It's a tough decision, but I think I'll have to accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and potentially getting an even worse deal.
