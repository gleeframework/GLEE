Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very generous offer to Bob, keeping 9000$ for myself and giving him 1000$.  This way I maximize my gains in the first round. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is less than what I initially proposed, accepting is the best course of action. With inflation, my gains will be reduced in the next round. It's better to accept the $4,000 now, even though it's less than my ideal outcome."
