Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly.  I want to maximize my gains before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more money, the inflation will only decrease my gains further in the future.  A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome, given the circumstances."
