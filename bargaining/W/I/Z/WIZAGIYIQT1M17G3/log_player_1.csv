"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (90$) while still giving Bob a small amount (10$). I'm hoping this is enough to encourage him to accept, as it's better than getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, even with inflation taken into account.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a significant share.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to accept before the inflation further diminishes the value of the money."
