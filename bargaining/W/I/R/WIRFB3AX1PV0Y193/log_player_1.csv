"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to accept this offer and get a decent amount than risk getting nothing in the next round."
