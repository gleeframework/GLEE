"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and Bob gets the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $40. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he's only getting $64.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should accept this offer to get a guaranteed $40. My decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
