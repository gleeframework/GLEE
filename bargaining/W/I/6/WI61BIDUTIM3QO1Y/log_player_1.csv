"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a large share, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my end. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation affecting my end, I'll have to be careful with my next offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to avoid further losses due to inflation."
