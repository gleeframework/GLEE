"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 40 dollars is now worth less than 40 dollars in the first round, but Bob's 60 dollars is still worth the same.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer this time is:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of my potential gain in the first round, which is now worth 51.2% of its original value.

In the first round, I would have gained 50 dollars, which is now worth 50 * 0.512 = 25.6 dollars.

Considering this, Bob's offer of 45 dollars is actually a good deal for me, since it's more than the 25.6 dollars I would have gotten in the first round.
