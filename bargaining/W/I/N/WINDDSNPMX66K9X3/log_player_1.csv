"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to start, you can propose next!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, and keeping 80% for myself. This way, we both get something to work with for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split, but let's see how this goes! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less, so I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

Alice gain: 80 * 0.95 = 76
Bob gain: 20

Comparing this to Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 45
Bob gain: 55

I'd rather get 76 than 45, so I'll accept this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
