Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but the time pressure is mounting. This is my final offer before the value of our potential gains diminishes even further.

# Alice gain: 700000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. However, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half feels like a losing proposition. I need to push Alice closer to a more even split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a risk with the shrinking pot, but I won't accept an unfair deal.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping she'll see the seriousness of the situation. I've compromised slightly on my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a larger share to offset the inflation losses I'm incurring."
