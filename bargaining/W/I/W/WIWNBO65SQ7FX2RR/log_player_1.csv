Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm offering you $350,000, which is more than you'd get if we simply let inflation erode our potential gains. Let's be pragmatic and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
