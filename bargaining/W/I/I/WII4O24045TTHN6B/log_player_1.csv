"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $6,000, which is the same as in the first round, and Bob would gain $4,000, which is 20% less than his original gain in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
