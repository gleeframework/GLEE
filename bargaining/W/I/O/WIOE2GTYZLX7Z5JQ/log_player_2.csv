"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair deal. Take 100k, and I'll take the rest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
100k is a pretty low offer, especially considering Alice will get 900k. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair starting point, and we can both get a good chunk of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take 600k, and you can have 400k. It's a better deal for both of us than the last round, and we don't want to keep losing money to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money and avoids the risk of losing more to inflation in the next round."
