Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm only getting 20% of the total, which is a significant drop from my initial proposal. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again, as I'm only getting 15% of the total, which is a very small share. I'm not willing to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a slightly more generous offer than before. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still trying to hold onto a decent share of the total."
