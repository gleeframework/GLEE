"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll reject it.
