"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  Think about the decreasing value! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, that offer wasn't in the spirit of the game. I'm lowering my cut a bit, but time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me with the time constraint, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While the value is decreasing, holding out for a better deal is the optimal strategy at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. Let's be reasonable.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a slightly advantageous split.  The message emphasizes the time pressure without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm meeting you in the middle. Take it before inflation eats our profits! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame this as a compromise, but it's the same offer she made two rounds ago! The inflation is hurting me more, but accepting a bad deal out of fear isn't the best strategy.  I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Don't let greed cost us everything!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go for a strong play.  Offering a 50/50 split highlights the fairness while also playing on her potential fear of losing everything.  It's a strong bargaining position that emphasizes we both lose if she continues to be unreasonable."
