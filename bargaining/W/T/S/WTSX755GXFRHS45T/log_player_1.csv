"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise on a 3:2 split, a fair middle ground 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm getting a bit more cautious.

I'll consider Bob's compromise, but I'm not sure if it's fair. I'd rather not give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keeping a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 4:1 is too extreme 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! The money is worth a lot less than it used to be.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 4:1 split, even if it's a bit more generous than before. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting even scarcer, and I need to think carefully about my next move.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to be even more frugal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split, it's only fair""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and meet Bob halfway. Will he accept this offer?"
