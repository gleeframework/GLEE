Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer, Bob, considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 5 is the same as the offer Bob proposed in Round 2.  Given the rapid inflation working against Bob, accepting this offer now prevents further losses in the following rounds. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a worse deal later or even ending up with nothing."
