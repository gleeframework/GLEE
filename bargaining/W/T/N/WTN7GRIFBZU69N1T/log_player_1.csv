"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 6:4, a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.95 = 380000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.95 = 570000

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, I'll give you a bit more, but I need a good chunk""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
