"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. This is a better offer than your last one, and it gives us both a decent share. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, with her offers decreasing rapidly.  While my offer was also rejected, holding out for another round is the better strategy. Alice is likely to offer a much better deal in Round 4 as the value of the money plummets for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice, and the pot is shrinking.  This is a fair offer, even a little generous on my part considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm keeping it tilted in my favor.  The emphasis on the shrinking value due to inflation is meant to pressure Alice into accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. Let's try a more balanced approach. This is the last offer I'll make before we both risk losing a significant amount due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but this offer is as good as it's going to get.  While it's the same offer I made in Round 2, it's significantly better for me now due to the inflation difference.  If I reject this, she's likely to lowball me in a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" final round. Accepting now secures me a decent amount."
