**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding strong, but time is working against me more than her. While I want a better deal, I need to start being more flexible before the shrinking pot forces me to take a terrible offer.  I'll reject this, hoping to show her I'm serious, but I need to be prepared to concede more in the next round or two."
