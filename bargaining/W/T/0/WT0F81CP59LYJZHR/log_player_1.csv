"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and it's a relatively fair split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'll take 55, you take 45. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'd rather not take the 45$. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about 60 for me and 40 for you?""
}
```"
