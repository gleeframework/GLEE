Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means getting risky."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is getting too risky. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 44/56 split is much better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
