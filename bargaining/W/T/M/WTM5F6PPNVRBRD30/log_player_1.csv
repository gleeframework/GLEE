Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not falling for the'meet halfway' trick. I'm going to take what I deserve. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's frustrating that Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, at this point, accepting is the best option. I'm losing a significant amount of money with each round, and continuing to reject will only further decrease my potential gains. It's better to accept and salvage something than to continue losing money."
