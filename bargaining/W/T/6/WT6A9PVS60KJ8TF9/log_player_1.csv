Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a slightly unfair split. I think this will give me a good chance of getting Bob to accept, as he might be tempted to take something rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, I'll take it!"
