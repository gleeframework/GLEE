"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end the game quickly. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain more severely, I need to be more cautious. I'll think about it... 

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! With my gain being worth almost half of what it was initially, I need to be very careful. Considering the offer from Bob, I think it's a bit too close to the previous offer, but I'm not sure if I should push for more. 

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
