Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer.  While the offer is getting better, accepting now would still mean losing a significant amount of the potential value due to inflation. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting nothing looms larger."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm losing money every round we play.  This is more than fair, and a good deal for both of us.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, you are losing money, but I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is killing me.  While this isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all if Alice continues to play hardball."
