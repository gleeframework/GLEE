"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and I want to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly bigger share. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money I'd gain being worth 14.26% less than the initial $10,000, I'm getting increasingly cautious.

Bob's offer is still a 70-30 split, which is quite skewed in his favor. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'll have to be even more strategic. Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than the initial $10,000, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. Let's find a middle ground!""
}
```"
