"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept this offer. The inflation effect is already making the money less valuable, and Bob's offer is still skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive as the game goes on. With the inflation effect taking a bigger toll on the value of the money, I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect really taking hold, I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth less and less, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make the most of this. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal while also acknowledging that the value of the money is rapidly decreasing."
