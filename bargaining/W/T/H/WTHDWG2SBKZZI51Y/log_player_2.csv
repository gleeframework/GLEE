{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me.  I'm willing to give you 30 dollars if I get 70. This is your last chance for a decent offer, Alice, as the money will be worth less with each round.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60 this time.  We both get a fair share, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation.

# Alice gain: 40
