"Round 1

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I don't think I deserve to get 40% of the total, while Bob gets 60%. I'll try to negotiate further!"

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a higher share""

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
