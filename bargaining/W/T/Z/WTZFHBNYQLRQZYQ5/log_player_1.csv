"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the numbers, I think I can do better than a 30-70 split. I'll reject this offer.
