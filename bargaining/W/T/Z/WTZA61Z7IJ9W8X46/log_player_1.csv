"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable split, given that the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $450,000 (20% less than $600,000)
Bob's gain: $490,000 (10% less than $550,000)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's slightly better than my original proposal. I'll accept the offer.
