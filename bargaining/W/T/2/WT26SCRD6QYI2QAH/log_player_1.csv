"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, it's far too low. The inflation is hitting hard, but I still have a lot of rounds to negotiate. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split in my favor. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a better deal for me than Bob's previous proposal. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm offering a 4500/5500 split.  While the inflation is making each round more difficult, I'm still aiming for a fair deal.  I'm willing to concede more, but I need to secure a reasonable amount to avoid losing too much to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a serious toll, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is too high."
