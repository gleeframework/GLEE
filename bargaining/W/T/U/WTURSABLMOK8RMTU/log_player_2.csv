"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm happy to take a slightly smaller share, hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less for Alice each round, she might be willing to give up more to get this settled quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fairer deal considering the inflation affecting your share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 40%. Let's split it 48/52. That's a fairer deal given the inflation, and we can avoid going through more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Alice's share is getting significantly devalued with each round, and while I'd prefer a 60/40 split, the 48/52 split is a decent compromise. It's likely that going through more rounds will only lead to a smaller gain for me."
