"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Since the money is worth less in each round, I'll likely get more if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, given the circumstances. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though I'm losing more money due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice will compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you more, but I need to get a fair share as well. Time is running out.""}
```"
