"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a decent amount, but not so generous that I'm giving away too much of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fairer split. This way, we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob has made a counteroffer, but it's actually the same offer as my original one, just with the labels swapped. I'm not interested in accepting this offer, since I was hoping for a more generous split.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my offer is:

  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can end the game!""
