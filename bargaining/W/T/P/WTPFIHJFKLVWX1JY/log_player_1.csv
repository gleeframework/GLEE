"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can wrap up the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since the money I gain is worth less than it was in the first round. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'm getting a bit more cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a bit more to account for the inflation. Consider this offer, Bob.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. Consider this offer, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With my gains worth almost half of what they were in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further, but I'm starting to worry that I might end up with nothing if we keep going. I'll need to make a stronger offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now! With my gains worth less than half of what they were in the first round, I'm getting very cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. This is my best offer. Take it and we can finally settle this.""
}
```

I'm not sure how much more I can give up, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game."
