"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer splits the money 60/40 in Alice's favor. It's a reasonable starting point that offers a significant advantage for Alice, while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. Considering the inflation, my share will be worth less in the next round, and there's no guarantee Bob will make a better offer.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
