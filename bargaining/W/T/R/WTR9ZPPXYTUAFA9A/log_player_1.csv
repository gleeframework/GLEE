I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent share right away, rather than risking a smaller share in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 5500 for me and 4500 for Bob.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a better deal than his last offer."
