"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. Let's see if you'll accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I'm hoping he'll make an even more aggressive offer in the next round, so I can negotiate from a stronger position!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate taking its toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too aggressive, Bob. Meet me in the middle and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, hoping to nudge him towards a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to the middle, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's see if you'll meet me halfway. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, hoping that he'll make another move. I'm not ready to meet him halfway just yet, and I think I can get a better deal if I wait a bit longer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to be more aggressive. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at the midpoint. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up much more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split of $5,000 each, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
