"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. This way, I get the most money for myself and the deal is still reasonably fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept this offer. Although I would prefer to receive more, the inflation means that waiting for my turn might result in a worse deal. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
