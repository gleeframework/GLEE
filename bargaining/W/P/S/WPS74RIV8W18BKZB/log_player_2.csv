Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to look out for myself. This offer is a slight compromise on my end, acknowledging the time pressure but still aiming for a somewhat balanced outcome. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of Alice's share is decreasing rapidly. While I'd prefer a larger share, her willingness to accept less is working in my favor.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the risk of getting nothing increases. We're past the halfway point.
* **Future Offers:**  Alice's offers have been getting progressively closer to a 50/50 split. If the trend continues, her next offer might be even less favorable to me. 

It's a tough call, but in this scenario, securing something is better than risking nothing."
