I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, and I know that in the next round, the money will be worth even less for me. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split in my favor. While I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, I need to make sure I get a decent share. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it to avoid further inflation."
