This is my first offer, Alice.  I think it's a fair starting point.  You get the lion's share, but I still get a decent amount. Let's see if we can come to an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. This is a fairer split, as we both get a substantial amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. This is a decent offer and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Let's end this game!"
