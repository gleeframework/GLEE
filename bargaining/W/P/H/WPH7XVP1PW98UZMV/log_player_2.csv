"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
It might seem like a fair deal initially, but I stand to make more if I wait.  Alice doesn't experience inflation, so she's more likely to offer me a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""How about a slightly better split for me this time, Alice? Considering the time limit, it's in our best interest to settle quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to give away the whole farm. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is starting to budge, but the deal still isn't favorable enough. With each round, the pressure increases on her as well, since she knows I'm aiming for a larger share. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  This offer is more than fair considering we're already at round 4 and I'm the one experiencing inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline. I'm increasing my offer, but let's be realistic. It's time to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one. Alice is right, we're running out of time. However, her offer is worse than round 3!  I need to hold my ground and show I'm serious about getting a reasonable share, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  60/40 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! I'm making a final concession. Let's split it 65/35, or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to accept less than 40%, but we're running out of time.  Alice is clearly holding firm, and any further rejection means we both walk away with nothing.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better than losing everything to inflation."
