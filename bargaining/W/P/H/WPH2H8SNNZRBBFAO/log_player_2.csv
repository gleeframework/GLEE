"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair. Let's split it 90/10, and I'll keep the bigger share since I'm making the first offer.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the 1000$ quickly, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can still do better. Let's split it 52.5/47.5.  This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end the game before the inflation eats too much away from our gains.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer my original proposal, I think this is a good compromise. Accepting this offer ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation takes a bigger bite out of our gains."
