"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since we have 12 rounds, and the money could inflate for Bob, it's better to secure a larger share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  There's no guarantee Bob will make a more generous offer in the future, and the inflation risk makes it unwise to continue hoping for a better deal."
