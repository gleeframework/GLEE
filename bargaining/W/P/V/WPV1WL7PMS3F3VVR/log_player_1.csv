"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Ah, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share slightly, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my offer's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it. The value of my share is still significant, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
