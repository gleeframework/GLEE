It seems like there is a repeat in the prompt. To continue the game correctly, I will proceed with the understanding that we are indeed in Round 4 and that my last offer was made but the outcome wasn't provided. However, since the prompt asks for a new offer without specifying the outcome of the previous one, I'll make a new proposal considering the inflation and the game's progression.
