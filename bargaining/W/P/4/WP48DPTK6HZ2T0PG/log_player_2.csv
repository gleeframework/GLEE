"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth seeing what kind of offer Alice will make in the next round.  Since we have 12 rounds, there's time to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair starting point and avoids immediate conflict. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let her get away with it.  It's still too early in the game to give in.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 6000, but still offering a decent amount to Alice.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2710 
# Alice gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offers are getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  There are still rounds left, and I need to see if I can negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but I'm still offering a significant portion to Alice.  The inflation is starting to get serious, so I need to secure a larger share of the money before it loses more value.  I hope Alice will recognize that the time for negotiation is running out and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3439 
# Alice gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  But I'm not giving in.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal, and I'm going to try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe there is still a chance to get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```

The inflation is making the situation desperate. I need to secure a larger portion of the money before it's worth almost nothing. I'm going to offer Alice 2000, which is still a decent amount given the inflation, and I'm hoping she'll recognize that it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4096 
# Alice gain: 5904 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt.  Alice's offers are getting worse and worse, but I'm still not giving in.  I'm going to try to get a better offer in the next round, and I'm going to try to get a better split.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not going to give up on getting a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

We're getting dangerously close to the end. Inflation is eating away at the money, and Alice's offers are getting worse. I'm going to push hard for the largest share possible.  This offer gives Alice at least something, but it's a significant risk for her if she rejects it.  Hopefully, she'll accept to avoid losing out completely."
