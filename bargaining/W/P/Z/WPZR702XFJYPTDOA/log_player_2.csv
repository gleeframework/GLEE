"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. This is a fair offer, take it! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  This split reflects that we both lose value over time, but you lose it faster."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. This is a fair split that considers our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor.  It's important to remain firm and demonstrate that I understand the impact of inflation on her share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm meeting you halfway. This is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of your share with each round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are both losing value here.  Let's split the difference and move on.  This is a fair and equal split for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and offering an even split. While I could push for more in earlier rounds, the longer the negotiation goes, the less her share is worth to her, increasing the risk of her making worse offers or us running out of rounds. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a fair outcome for both of us."
