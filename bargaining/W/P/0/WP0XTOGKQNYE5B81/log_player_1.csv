"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm taking a large chunk for myself (900k), but leaving Bob with a decent share (100k). This should hopefully incentivize him to accept in the first round, especially since the money loses value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000, and with the inflation, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
