"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80 and you take 20.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me taking the majority of the $100. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, even if it's a slightly smaller share than in the previous round. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 is a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
