{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Your 50/50 split sounds fair in principle, but the value of the money decreases over time, and the decrease is worse for you than for me.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for this difference.  What do you say?""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation issue, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  I propose 55/45 in my favor to acknowledge the inflation, but still maintain a closer to equal split.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
