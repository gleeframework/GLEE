"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of my potential gain due to inflation. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
