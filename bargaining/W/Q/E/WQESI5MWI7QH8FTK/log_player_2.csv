"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split.  I'm willing to give you a generous share, but I also need to make sure I get a good amount for myself. What do you think?

""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share than what you proposed.  Let's aim for a 70/30 split. This ensures we both get something, but it's more equitable to my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the faster inflation on my side. While she's compromising slightly, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to hold out for a more balanced offer, even with the shrinking pot."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon or we both lose. I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  It's closer to the middle ground and accounts for the time pressure.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point, and the value is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Compromise:** While I'd prefer a more even split, I need to offer something more appealing to Alice than her previous offers.  
* **Urgency:** My message emphasizes the need for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round.  Let's move closer to the middle. I'm offering a 65/35 split. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the right words by mentioning compromise and a sense of urgency, but her actions don't match. While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation working against me. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't propose a fairer deal soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and our potential gains are shrinking fast. I'm proposing a 50/50 split - a fair and equal deal. Take it or leave it, but let's not waste any more time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I need to make it clear this is my best and final offer.
* **Urgency:**  With less than half the rounds remaining, the time pressure is immense.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is the most logically sound and equitable solution.  
* **Simplicity:** By making a straightforward, non-negotiable offer, I'm hoping Alice will see the value in a quick and clean agreement."
