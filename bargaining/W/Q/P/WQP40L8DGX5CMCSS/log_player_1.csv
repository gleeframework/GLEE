"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is greedy or if he's willing to play a longer game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
It's better to take the 500,000 than risk getting nothing. There's no guarantee that Bob will be more generous in the next round."
