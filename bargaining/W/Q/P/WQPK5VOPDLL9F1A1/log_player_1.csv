"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money (900,000$) and Bob a smaller portion (100,000$).  I am taking a gamble that Bob will accept this offer in the first round, as he doesn't know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000 dollars. Considering the inflation, any further rounds would likely result in me getting less than this amount."
