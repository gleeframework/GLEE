"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering 60 dollars to myself and 40 dollars to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","For Round 2, the money is worth less for me, but Bob's gain is worth even less for him due to the 20% inflation.

I'll reject this offer since it's still not in my favor.

```

I'm offering 55 dollars to myself and 45 dollars to Bob."
