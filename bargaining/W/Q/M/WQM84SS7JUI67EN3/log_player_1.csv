I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round. I'll offer Bob a small amount to see if he'll take it.  It's likely he'll reject, but I'll get the chance to propose again in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I'm losing 40% of my initial gains due to inflation, taking 5000$ now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal in the future."
