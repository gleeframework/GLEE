"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 equally between us, 50-50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd like to try to get a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Bob's offer is a bit more generous to him than to me, but it's still a good starting point.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
