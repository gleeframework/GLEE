"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good share of the money.  Since I'm the one making the first proposal, I figure I can get a bigger chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's a huge drop in my share, even though I'm getting the money now and the value is deflated. It's worth taking the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and  get a larger share again this round. Bob rejected my offer, and now he's the one feeling the sting of inflation.  I'm hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation hit Bob harder than me, his offer is still way too low. I'm willing to gamble on another round to try and get closer to a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still hoping to get a larger share of the money, even though I'm feeling the effects of inflation. I'm going to stick to a consistent strategy of offering a higher proportion for myself, but not going all-in and risking everything.  I think this offer is reasonable and gives Bob a fair chance to get a decent amount."
