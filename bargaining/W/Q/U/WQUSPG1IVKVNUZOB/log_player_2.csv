Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split this 60/40, and we can both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer in a future round. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Due to the higher inflation rate for Alice, her offers are likely to become less favorable to Bob as time goes on. 
* **Present Value:** Accepting $400,000 now is better than a potentially slightly larger sum later, once inflation is factored in.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the future. She might become more insistent on a larger share for herself."
