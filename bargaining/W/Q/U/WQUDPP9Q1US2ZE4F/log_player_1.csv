"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
