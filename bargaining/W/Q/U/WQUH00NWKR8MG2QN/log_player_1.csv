Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The gap in our inflation rates is significant, impacting the value of our gains differently. I'm willing to compromise but still reflect this disparity.

# Bob gain: 55

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money is worth to me due to the higher inflation rate I face. 
* **Bob's Concessions:**  Bob has moved slightly closer to a more even split from his initial offer. It's unlikely he'll concede much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer risks even lower gains in subsequent rounds, especially if Bob plays hardball.

Accepting a 45/55 split is better than potentially getting a much worse deal later or even walking away with nothing."
