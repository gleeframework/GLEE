"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider whether I'm getting a fair deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since I rejected Bob's offer and it's now round 3, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
