I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer. I'll make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $8,000, but I'm still offering Bob a decent share.  Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal. I'll keep rejecting until he gets the point!  It's not worth it to accept this offer, especially with the inflation hitting so hard."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each round. I'm still offering a decent share, and I think he might be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn! I'm going to reject this offer again.  I'm not giving in to his demands. Let's see how much longer he can hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting desperate now, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal. I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is still better than nothing.  The inflation is killing us both, so I hope he'll see reason and accept this offer."
