"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I'm sure you understand that a 50/50 split would be the fairest outcome. To move things along, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the time value of money given the inflation we're facing. Think carefully about this offer. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
