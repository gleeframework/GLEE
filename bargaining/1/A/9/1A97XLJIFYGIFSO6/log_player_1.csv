"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my share while still offering something to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept the offer and avoid the risk of inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. While I would have preferred my original proposal, the risk of further inflation makes this offer too good to refuse."
