Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer since I was the one initially offering the 60-40 split in my favor, and now Bob is offering the same split but in his favor. I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground. This time, I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer.
