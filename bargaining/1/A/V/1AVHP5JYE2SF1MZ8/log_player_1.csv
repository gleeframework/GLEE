Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the further inflation and Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of 58/42. It's not the best deal I could get, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to give me a bit more. I'll take the 58 and call it a day."
