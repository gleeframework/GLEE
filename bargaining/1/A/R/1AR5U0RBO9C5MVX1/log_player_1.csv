"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split, as I believe it's fair considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the risks of inflation, and it allows for a more equitable distribution of the funds. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
