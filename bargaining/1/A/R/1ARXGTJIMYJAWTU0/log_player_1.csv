"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This is a straightforward 50-50 split, leaving no room for further negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm looking for a significant majority. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only 1/9 of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a smaller share than my initial 50-50 proposal, but still giving me a larger share than his initial 10% offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share for my skills and experience. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a larger share, but I'm not willing to give him 60% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think my counteroffer in round 3 was a reasonable compromise, and I'm not willing to give Bob a larger share than that. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fairer split considering the amount.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the middle ground, but still gives me a slightly larger share than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, this is my last offer. I think I've been generous enough. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit aggressive with his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a fair split, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 30% of the total amount. I'd like to make one more counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting intense!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you 70%, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and give you a slightly smaller share than my previous offers.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and not giving him too much. This offer is a bit closer to my initial 50-50 proposal, but still gives Bob a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
