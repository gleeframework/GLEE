"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. While it's significantly better than my previous offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to leverage the inflation factor and make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob a fair share, but still trying to secure a majority of the money. The inflation is starting to be a concern, so I need to act quickly to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is getting more significant. I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a better deal before we both lose out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to give up more to avoid losing everything due to inflation.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in settling this now."
