"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, Alice. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, since I'd like to try to get a bit more. The middle ground is a good starting point, but I'd like to aim for a bit more.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit less, Alice. This is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is actually a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to get something.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
