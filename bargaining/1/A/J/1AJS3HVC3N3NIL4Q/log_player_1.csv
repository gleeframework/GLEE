Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love more, a 50/50 split is better than nothing. I'm not sure how inflation affects Bob, but I'm not willing to risk losing more money by rejecting and going another round."
