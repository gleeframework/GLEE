"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split.  I'm willing to take a bit less this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50/50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect."
