Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a larger share. How about we settle for a 55/45 split in my favor this time?  It reflects a similar ratio to your offer but accounts for the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
