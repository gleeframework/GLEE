I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me most of the money, but leaves Bob with something small.  Since we have 12 rounds, I can afford to be a little greedy in the early stages.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation penalty, this offer is much better than the 5% I would get if we keep playing.  It's worth accepting, as there's no guarantee I'll get anything better in the future."
