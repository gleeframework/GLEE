"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the devaluation. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
