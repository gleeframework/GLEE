"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it since it's a relatively early round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I don't want to push Bob away with an extremely low offer, since it's still an early round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll aim for a higher share to make up for it. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
