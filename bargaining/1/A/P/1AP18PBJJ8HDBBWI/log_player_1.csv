"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'll take the bigger share since I'm making the first offer.""}\n\nHow's that? I tried to make a reasonable offer while also considering the fact that the money loses value for me over time. Let me know what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering we both have to agree. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the 55-45 split, especially since the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation. I think I can make a better offer in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's proposal. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and get this done!""}\n\nI've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less to me now, so I've reduced my share slightly. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. Fingers crossed!"
