6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a simple split - 60/40.  It's a good deal for you to get this settled quickly.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Your split was a bit too greedy for me.  How about we meet in the middle, a 55/45 split seems fair.  Let's not lose any more money to inflation!",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm confident we can find a solution that's even better for both of us. Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be strategic. I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This still gives me a slight advantage, reflecting my initial offer, but avoids further losses from inflation. Time is ticking!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're letting good money evaporate!  I'm coming down a bit to 52/48. This is a strong offer, and it's better to settle now than risk losing even more with further delays.",Bob,4,
,,"You're right about the inflation, Bob, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits us both.",Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's stop this back and forth before inflation eats away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges my earlier offers while still leaving you with a respectable share.  What do you say, deal?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
