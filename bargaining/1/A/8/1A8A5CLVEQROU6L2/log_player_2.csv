Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be strategic. I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This still gives me a slight advantage, reflecting my initial offer, but avoids further losses from inflation. Time is ticking!

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop this back and forth before inflation eats away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges my earlier offers while still leaving you with a respectable share.  What do you say, deal?
