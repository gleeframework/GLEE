Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is a fairer reflection of our respective needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
