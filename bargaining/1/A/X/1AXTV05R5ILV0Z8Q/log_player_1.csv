{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. Let's see if we can work this out before inflation takes a bigger bite. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.
