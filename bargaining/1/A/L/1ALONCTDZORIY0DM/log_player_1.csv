Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  The inflation is clearly affecting his perception of what's fair, but I'm not going to be pressured into a bad deal. I'm confident I can secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. This offer acknowledges the inflation, but it still keeps a majority of the money for me. I'm hoping that Bob will realize it's time to come to an agreement."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000

Even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better than the possibility of continuing to reject offers and facing further inflation.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
