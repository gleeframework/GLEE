This is a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm taking a bit more since the inflation will affect Bob more heavily than me in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more money, the inflation will only make it worse for me in the next round.  It's better to take the 4000 now."
