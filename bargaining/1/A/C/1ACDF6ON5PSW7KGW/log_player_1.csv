Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While inflation will impact us both, I'm hoping this is fair considering your share will be worth more than mine in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
