"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not accepting this offer.  While I understand the game is about negotiation and compromise, I'm not going to settle for a single dollar! I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50} 
``` 
Let's start with a fair split.  I think 50/50 is a reasonable place to begin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still not accepting this offer. While I understand inflation is a factor, a gain of only 2 dollars with a 36% decrease in value isn't worth it.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 60/40. I'm still trying to be fair, but I'm also starting to feel the effects of inflation. Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3 
# Alice gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still rejecting this offer. The value of my gain is diminishing rapidly due to inflation. I need a much better deal to make this worthwhile.  I'm going to continue trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30} 
``` 

I'm raising my offer again to 70/30. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still hoping for a fair compromise.  I'm willing to give up more of the money to try to avoid getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4 
# Alice gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is simply not worth it.  The value of my gain is rapidly declining, and a mere 4 dollars with a 73.79% decrease is almost meaningless. I'm still hopeful that we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20} 
``` 

I'm making a significant concession and offering 80/20.  Inflation is making it increasingly difficult to get a fair share, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize the need for a compromise before we both lose everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still rejecting this offer.  While I understand that time is running out and I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small gain. I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm making a final desperate attempt to secure a decent share of the money.  Inflation is eroding my potential gain rapidly, and I'm running out of time.  I'm hoping that Alice recognizes the urgency and is willing to accept a 90/10 split to avoid both of us getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6 
# Alice gain: 94 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the situation is dire, with inflation decimating the value of my potential gain, I can't accept this offer.  It's not worth the effort to receive such a small amount of money. I'm going to try one last time to get a better deal in the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5} 
```

This is my final offer. With the relentless inflation, I'm willing to take a significant share of the money, leaving Alice with a small portion.  I'm hoping Alice realizes that it's better to accept a small gain than to risk both of us getting nothing."
