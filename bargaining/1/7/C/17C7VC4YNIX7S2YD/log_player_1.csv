"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my share more than Bob's. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
