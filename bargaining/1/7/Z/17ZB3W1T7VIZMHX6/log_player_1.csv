"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can both do better. This offer is more in line with our respective values of the money in this round. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now. I think I can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle again!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob!"
