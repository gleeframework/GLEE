"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This gives us both a fair share while considering the potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 4:1 is a more reasonable split, considering the potential loss due to inflation. This way, I get a bigger share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
