60.0,40.0,"Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is reasonable given the inflation dynamic. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"You're starting with a 60/40 split? I think you're being a bit too aggressive. I'll offer a 70/30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous since you're the one who made the first offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable. I understand you're feeling aggressive, but a 50/50 split is the fairest option right now given the inflation. It's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
15.0,85.0,"You think 50/50 is fair? I don't think so. With the inflation, I'm already losing value. I'll offer you a 90/10 split, but I'm willing to make it worth your while. You'll get a bigger share than you would in a 50/50 split, and I'll still get a decent chunk.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but a 90/10 split is unacceptable. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to 45/55.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and it's a better deal than your last offer. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
8.0,92.0,"You're getting desperate, and I'm getting impatient. I'm willing to make a slightly smaller offer, but I'm not budging much. 92/8 is the best I'm willing to do. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
35.0,65.0,"Look, we're running out of time. I know you're trying to maximize your gains, but we both need to be reasonable. A 35/65 split is the best I can offer right now. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation, and it's better than getting nothing. Let's make a deal.",Alice,7,
