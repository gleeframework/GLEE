Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. This offer is still generous, considering. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though it's not the ideal split, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is hitting me (Bob) much harder than Alice. Every round that passes significantly diminishes the value of my potential gain. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to hold out for a better deal in the hopes that Alice will crack under pressure is too risky.  The longer the game goes, the less the money will be worth, making even a ""win"" a significantly reduced reward. 
* **Alice's Resolve:** Alice has been consistently offering a similar deal, indicating she might be firm on her position. 

While 400,000 is less than I aimed for, it's better to secure this amount now than risk getting even less in a future round where inflation has further eroded the value.
