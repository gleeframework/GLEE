Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but the inflation hurts you more than me. I'm sticking with my previous offer for now.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need a bit more than that. This offer acknowledges the inflation while still giving us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting me harder than Alice. While her offer is slightly better, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, closer to 50/50, even with the shrinking pot.  I'm betting Alice will become more agreeable as the rounds progress and the potential gains diminish."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The clock is ticking, and our potential gains are dwindling.  I'm offering you a deal where I absorb the brunt of the inflation. Let's be sensible and close this out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand.  Alice needs to understand the urgency of the situation. This offer is still generous considering the rapid inflation working against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline.  This offer is a compromise, and it's the best I can do considering the inflation is affecting you more. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better than anything she has proposed before. More importantly, time is running out, and the inflation is severely eroding my potential gains with each passing round. Accepting now guarantees me something, while continuing to push for a marginally better deal significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing."
