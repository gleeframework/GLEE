"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm trying to get a better deal by offering a 55-45 split, which is still a compromise, but slightly more favorable to me."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight majority 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the value of the money more significantly than before. I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make another counteroffer to get a more favorable split."
