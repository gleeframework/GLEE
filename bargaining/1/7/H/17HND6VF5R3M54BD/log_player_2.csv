"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split, let's start with this 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation will hurt Alice more than me.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split will benefit us both in the long run. This way, we can both get more after inflation takes its bite.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to my initial proposal 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice has compromised, and while I'm not thrilled about it, this is a good deal for me considering the inflation.  I'll take it!"
