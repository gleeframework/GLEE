"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my gains. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is kicking in, and my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this time, with a 42-58 split, but I'm still holding firm on getting a bigger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still a 70-30 split, and I think I can do better than that, considering the significant drop in value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential gains, so I need to be careful with my next offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000
}
```

I'm offering a 36-64 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm trying to balance it out to account for the rapid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money being worth so much less, I need to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out and the value of the money decreasing rapidly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still a 80-20 split, and I think I can do better than that, considering the extreme inflation. However, I'm starting to wonder if I'll be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really accelerating, and my potential gains are dwindling rapidly. With that in mind, I'll make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm pushing for a 40-60 split, hoping that Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops too much further."
