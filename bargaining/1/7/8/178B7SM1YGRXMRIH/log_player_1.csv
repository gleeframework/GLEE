"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving you a free ride! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll accept this offer for now. The 50-50 split is a good compromise, and I'd rather get $5,000 than risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
