Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I think your offer is still too far off from a fair split. I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This would still be beneficial for both of us, considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 550000
