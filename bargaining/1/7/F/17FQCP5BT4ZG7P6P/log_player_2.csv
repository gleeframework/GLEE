Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing for me (Bob), Alice is still not moving far enough. Accepting 43 now means I think a deal is impossible and I'll take anything over nothing. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it for a better share. The next offer needs to be my strongest push yet, or I risk getting even worse offers as time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We both lose if we keep going like this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By saying ""final offer"", Bob signals a strong position and a willingness to walk away. This can pressure Alice to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 48/52 is a small concession from 50/50, which might make it more palatable to Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing that time is running out reminds Alice of the shared risk of getting nothing.

This is a risky move, as Alice might call Bob's bluff. However, given Alice's previous offers and the increasing inflation, it's a calculated risk Bob needs to take for a chance at a better outcome."
