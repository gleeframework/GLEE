Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise!""

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, I was too generous, huh?

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll gain are:
