This is a pretty standard starting point. I'm keeping a large majority of the money for myself, since I'm the one making the offer.  However, I'm still giving Bob a decent amount to make it tempting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good deal for me.  While I would have gotten 6000 in the previous round, after inflation it is worth less than 5000 to me. I would rather accept this 50/50 split now than risk getting less in the next round."
