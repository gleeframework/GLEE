# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a more favorable division in the next round.

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is closer to what I proposed in the previous round, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal, especially considering the impact of inflation on Alice's gain is higher than mine.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 4

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is taking a toll on both of our potential gains, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice is losing more value to inflation than I am, so I'll try to use that to my advantage.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and losing money with every passing round. I'm adjusting my offer to $53 for me and $47 for you. It reflects the shrinking pie but still gives you a reasonable share. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. With the money being worth 26.49% less for me and 46.86% less for Alice compared to the first round, it's time to accept a deal that still gives me a decent share. Further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome, and the risk of losing more value to inflation is too high.\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to accept Alice's offer and finalize the agreement."
