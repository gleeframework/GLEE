"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away with the easy split so easily! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $5,000 gain is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,750.

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $3,000, which is worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $2,850.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get a better deal by waiting for the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $4,750 gain from the previous round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,487.50.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but not too much""
}
```

This way, I'll get $4,200, which is worth 94% of the original $4,500 I was hoping for, and Bob will get $5,800."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm starting to get desperate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $4,487.50 gain from the previous round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3,854.68.

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $4,000, which is worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $8,000. This is actually a better deal than I was getting in my previous offer, and it's a significant increase from the $3,854.68 I was worth.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a good opportunity to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
