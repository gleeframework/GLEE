Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would give Bob significantly less than half the pot.  The inflation is hurting Bob more than Alice, so it's in Bob's best interest to try and push for a more favorable split in the next couple of rounds before the value drops significantly."
