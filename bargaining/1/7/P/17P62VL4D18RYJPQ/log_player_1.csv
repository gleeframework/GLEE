"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair start to the game, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain would be worth 80% of the original amount, so I'd be getting 48 dollars.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially since Bob is taking a huge share. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, no need to be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With the 48.8% inflation, my gain would be worth 51.2% of the original amount, so I'd be getting 51.2% of $100, which is approximately 51.20 dollars.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially since Bob is taking a larger share. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need some for myself, 40-60 is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more flexible and offer a larger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting aggressive, you're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gain! With the 67.23% inflation, my gain would be worth 32.77% of the original amount, so I'd be getting approximately $32.77.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll accept the offer.
