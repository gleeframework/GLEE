"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'm willing to take a little more since you rejected my offer last time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it. This is a good compromise considering Alice's offer is worth less due to inflation."
