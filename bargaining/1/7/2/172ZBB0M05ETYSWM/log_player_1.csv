"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and inviting Bob to make his move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is still worth $4000, but Bob's gain of $6000 is worth $5,400.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
