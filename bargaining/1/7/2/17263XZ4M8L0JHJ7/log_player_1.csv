"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Now it's my turn to be generous.  Accept this offer and we can both end the game early.  If you reject, remember the money will be worth less next time! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $80,000 (since 80% of $100,000 is $80,000).

I'll have to think carefully... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! This is a fair offer. Accept and let's end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. The money will be worth less next time, and I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now due to inflation!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $64,000 (since 51.2% of $200,000 is $102,400, but due to the previous rounds of inflation, it is now 48.8% of the original value, so it is actually 51.2% * 80% * 80% * 80% = 32.768 * 200,000 = 65,536, but due to the previous rounds of inflation, it is now 48.8% of the original value, so it is actually 51.2% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% = 32.768 * 200,000 = 65,536 * 0.488 = 31,942.784, but I'll round it to 32,000 for simplicity).

However, I will use the original value of the offer to make my decision.

I'll have to think carefully...
