Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance for a decent share. I'm offering you $35.  The value will plummet next round, making it pointless to continue. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
