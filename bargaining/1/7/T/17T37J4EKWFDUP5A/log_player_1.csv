"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was a bit too aggressive with my initial offer.

Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth 80% of $600,000, which is $480,000. Bob's offer of $300,000 is a significant reduction from my original proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly lower amount to account for inflation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $450,000 and Bob $550,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth 51.2% of $600,000, which is $306,720. Bob's offer of $400,000 is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to account for the remaining value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, giving me $420,000 and Bob $580,000. I'm hoping this will be the final offer that Bob accepts!"
