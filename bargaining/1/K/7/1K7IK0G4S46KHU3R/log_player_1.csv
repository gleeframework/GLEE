"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle. We both lose money with each round, so it's in our best interest to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
