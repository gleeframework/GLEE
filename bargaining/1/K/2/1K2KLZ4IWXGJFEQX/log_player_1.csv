I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'll be willing to negotiate a bit, but I want to get the most money possible for myself.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is more equitable than my initial one, but I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse. I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money, even though inflation is hitting us hard. I will reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm taking a bit of a risk here by raising my offer again, but I'm hoping Bob is starting to get nervous about the decreasing value of the money. I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm recognizing that I need to make a concession to avoid ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one!  Inflation is taking a huge bite out of the money, and I'm starting to worry that if I keep rejecting, we might end up with nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer this time. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.  I'm still feeling a little bitter about how the negotiations went, but I'll live with it."
