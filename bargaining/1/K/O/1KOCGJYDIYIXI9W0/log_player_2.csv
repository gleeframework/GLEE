Alice's offer:

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think a 51/49 split in my favor is a fair starting point, since the money is worth 5% less to me each round.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. It seems we both want a slight advantage, but I think a 50/50 split is the most logical solution, especially considering the inflation affecting your share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
