It's worth taking a chance and seeing if I can get a better deal.  Even with inflation, I'm likely to get more than $100,000 if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split that's more fair to me, but still gives Alice something. I'm hoping she'll see that it's in her best interest to accept, given the potential for inflation in the later rounds."
