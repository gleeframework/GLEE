# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is on my side. The value of her share is decreasing rapidly with each round. I'll hold out for a better offer that reflects the increasing disparity in perceived value due to the inflation rule."

# Bob gain: 4600

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's frustration is growing, and her offers are becoming increasingly desperate.  While she's framed her offer as me being ""greedy,"" the reality is the longer the game goes on, the less her potential share is actually worth to her. I'm betting she'll break before I do."
