Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal where I get the lion's share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer means I get at least *something*, and with the inflation, the value of my share is decreasing with each round. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in the future."
