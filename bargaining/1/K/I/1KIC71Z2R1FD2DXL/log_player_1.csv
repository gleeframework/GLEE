"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45, which is a relatively fair share, but also takes into account that the money is worth less to him with each passing round, so he might be inclined to accept this offer rather than risking a worse offer in the next round. The message is a gentle nudge to make him consider the fairness of the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split, closer to 50/50. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $51 is actually worth less than the face value, and my gain of $49 is still the same value as in the first round. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with the next round's information."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more realistic split""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth even less to Bob, so I'm offering him $43, which is a bit less than the previous offer. The message is a reminder that the value of the money is decreasing for him, making this offer more reasonable.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to 50/50 again. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, considering the significant decrease in value for Bob's gain due to inflation, his offer of a 52/48 split is relatively generous. Additionally, Bob's message implies that this is his final offer, so I don't think I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. It's better to accept this offer and secure a gain of $52 rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round.\n\n###\n\nGame over! I'm happy with the outcome."
