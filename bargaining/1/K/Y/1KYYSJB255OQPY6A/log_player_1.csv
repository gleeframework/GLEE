"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value of the money I gain, I'm now looking at a gain of 510,000. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is even more favorable to him than my initial offer. I'll have to think carefully about this...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain by 5% twice, I'm now looking at a gain of 510,000 x 0.95 = 484,500. With that in mind, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to balance the value of the money I gain with the potential for a higher gain in later rounds."
