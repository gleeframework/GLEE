"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. Fair deal, I think. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems appealing at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation and my stronger position due to the faster devaluation of the money. I believe I can secure a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly.  Let's be reasonable: 55/45.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so let's be reasonable and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the value is decreasing, accepting a 50/50 split now would be premature.  The rate of inflation hurts me more than Alice, so she's feeling the pressure to settle. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing time is working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is dropping fast. I'm offering a 53/47 split. Let's close this deal and leave with something.""
