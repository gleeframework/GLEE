I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure I should start with a pretty strong offer, but leave room for negotiation if Bob rejects it.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer. Even though it's a 50/50 split, it's better than risking Bob getting more greedy in the next round.  The inflation might hurt him more than me.  It's a gamble, but I'll take it."
