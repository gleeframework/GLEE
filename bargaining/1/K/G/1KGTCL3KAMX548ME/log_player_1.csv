"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and I'm not going to accept it.  I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Bob proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60, hoping to find a more equitable split. This is still more favorable to me, but I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is even worse than the last one.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a compromise. This is still more favorable to me, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I'm trying to find a balance between securing a decent share and preventing further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too unfair to me.  I'm not willing to accept a share this small. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer one last time. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're running out of rounds, and that it's better to accept a smaller share than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still not acceptable. I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round.  I'm starting to worry about the limited rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm making a final, desperate attempt to secure a large portion of the remaining money.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to take a risk.  I'm hoping Bob understands that we're both losing money with each passing round, and that accepting this offer is better than the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is taking a serious toll.  Accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing at all. I'm hoping Bob realizes this is a good deal for both of us."
