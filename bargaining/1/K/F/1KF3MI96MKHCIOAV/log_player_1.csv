"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering to take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob will receive $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%"". I am willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal. If he rejects, the next round will begin, and he will make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he claims to be feeling generous, his proposal is still not fair in my opinion. With inflation, the $450,000 I would receive is actually worth less than its face value. Considering this, I believe I deserve a larger share. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know my decision and we can move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away, I need a bigger share""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering to take $700,000, which is 70% of the total amount, and Bob will receive $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. I attached a message saying ""Inflation is eating away, I need a bigger share"". Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I need to adjust my proposal to account for the loss in value. I am hoping Bob will understand the impact of inflation on my share and accept this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's settle this. I'll agree to your original split, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 48.8% less for me due to inflation, Bob's offer matches my original proposal from Round 1. Considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I think it's best to accept this offer rather than risking another round and potentially losing even more value. I believe this is a fair agreement, and I'm willing to settle for this split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know my decision, and we can conclude the game."
