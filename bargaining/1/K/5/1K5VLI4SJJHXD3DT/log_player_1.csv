"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, aiming to get most of the money while keeping Bob engaged.  I'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and while the inflation hurts my gain, it's still a better outcome than continuing to risk losing more in subsequent rounds."
