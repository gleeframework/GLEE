"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I propose to take 950,000 dollars and give Bob 50,000 dollars.  This ensures a large portion for me while still giving Bob a small share. I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's better than nothing, and we can avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, my gain is worth 5% less this round.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I still receive a significant amount, and it avoids the risk of further inflation potentially making my share even smaller in the next round."
