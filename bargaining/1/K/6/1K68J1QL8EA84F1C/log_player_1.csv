"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 1000, I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping the remaining $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable starting point.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob can take $5,000."
