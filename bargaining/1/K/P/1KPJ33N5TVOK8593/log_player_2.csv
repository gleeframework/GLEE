"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to divide the amount equally after accounting for the first round's inflation. I suggest we split it 700k for me and 300k for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though this is a good offer for the first round, I want to see if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making the proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I believe a 70/30 split in my favor is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's finish this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, I propose a division of 600k for me and 400k for you. This aims to balance our shares while taking into account the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the 400k is a good gain considering the inflation. It's likely that if I reject, Alice will propose a smaller share for me in the next round."
