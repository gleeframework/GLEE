Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives me a large advantage.  I'll keep 90% of the money and offer him 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal for me than the first round. Although I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, I'm still getting something rather than nothing. I'll accept this offer."
