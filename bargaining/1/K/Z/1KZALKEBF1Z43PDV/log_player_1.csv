I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer in the first round, considering the potential for inflation. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. While it's tempting, I'm going to reject it for now.  We have 10 more rounds, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is likely feeling the pressure from the inflation, so I'm going to see if I can exploit that in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly less generous split than the first round, but still a significant advantage for me. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept a deal closer to 80/20 in the face of continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the previous round.  He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is trying to capitalize on it. However, I'm not going to give in just yet.  I'm going to continue to play it tough and see if I can force a better deal in the next round.  With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is starting to mount, but I believe I can still get a better result."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as the last round. I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but not too drastically.  I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept a deal closer to 70/30, as the inflation continues to erode the value of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, but I'm not going to accept it just yet.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. With only six rounds left, the pressure is mounting, but I believe I can still get a better result. The inflation is clearly hurting Bob more than me, and I'm going to try to leverage that to my advantage."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer again, aiming for a 60/40 split.  While Bob's offers have been getting worse, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  With five rounds remaining, I need to start being more aggressive, but I'm confident that I can still get a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still 50/50, which is a step back from his previous offer.  While I'm feeling the pressure with only four rounds left, I'm not willing to accept this offer. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to take a gamble and offer a 55/45 split. I'm sensing that Bob is starting to panic as the rounds are dwindling, but I'm not sure how much further I can push him.  It's a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to try and get a slightly better deal than the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still going to reject it. With only three rounds left, I need to be aggressive, but I'm not going to give up just yet. I'm going to continue to hold out for a better deal and see if I can get a better outcome in the next round."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  It's a risky move with only two rounds remaining, but I believe it's the best option at this point. Bob is clearly under a lot of pressure from the inflation, and I'm hoping that he'll be willing to accept this offer to avoid getting nothing."
