"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain would be worth 80% of the original value, so the actual amount I would get is 50 * 0.8 = 40.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While a 50/50 split seems fair, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth 64% of the original value (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll aim to get a larger share this round to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```"
