"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI can try to negotiate for a better deal, considering the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice. Let's see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60-40?""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split considering the inflation affecting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll try to push my luck a bit further. Since the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation, I'll see if I can get an even better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll take into account the increasing effect of inflation on my gain and propose a split that reflects this. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""With inflation taking a bigger bite, I think 65-35 is a fairer split to make up for the lost value on my end.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 60-40 is a fair compromise considering the inflation is hitting you harder now. Let's settle this and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I think accepting this offer is the best course of action. The split of 60-40, with me getting 40, seems reasonable considering the circumstances. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me, making this a good point to settle and minimize losses.\n\n###\n\nGame over! It looks like Alice and I have reached a deal."
