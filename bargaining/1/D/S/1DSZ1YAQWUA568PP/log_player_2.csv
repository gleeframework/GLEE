Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer.  I'm coming down, but I need a good enough share for this to be worth it for me. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly increasing my share, it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation. With each round, the deal gets worse for me.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to push Alice to offer a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it - my time (and money!) is too valuable to waste with these games.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split is a strong signal that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  The ""take it or leave it"" language emphasizes that I'm not willing to budge much more. Alice will need to concede soon, or risk losing out entirely as inflation continues to erode my potential gains."
