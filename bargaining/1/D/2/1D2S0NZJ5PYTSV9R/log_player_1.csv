"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 remains the same.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd rather have a higher share, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. However, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I want more than 400k""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. My gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a majority""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount as well. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $160,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 remains the same.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to run out of time. I'd rather take this offer than risk going into the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.
