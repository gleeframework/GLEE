"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split, with the majority going to me. This is a fair offer considering the inflation will affect Bob more significantly in the later rounds. I believe this is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a significant improvement on the previous offer. While it's still a better deal for Bob, I believe the current inflation rates are a disadvantage to him as well. The 20% devaluation of my earnings each round is much more significant than his 5%, so I can afford to be patient and wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob. While this is still a significant difference, it's a more balanced offer than the previous round. My valuation is now 80% of the original amount, which is a considerable drop.  I am willing to compromise to ensure we both get something before the inflation becomes too severe."
