"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going easy on you just yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 4000 x 0.95 = 3800
* Bob gain: 6000 x 0.95 = 5700

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to get a bit more, so I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away all the money just yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still trying to hold onto a decent chunk of the money."

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money is really losing value fast! With inflation, the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 4500 x 0.8554 (1 - 0.1446) = 3853.40
* Bob gain: 5500 x 0.8554 = 4697.70

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll consider it, but I'd rather not accept it just yet.
