"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 75% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's constraints. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to an agreement. I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $160,000 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it's a significant decrease from my initial proposal. However, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer to move forward.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
