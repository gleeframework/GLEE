"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This is a much more equitable split. Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $680,000 and keeping $320,000 for myself."
