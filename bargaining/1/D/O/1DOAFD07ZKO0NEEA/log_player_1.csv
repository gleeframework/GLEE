"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split than the last one. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $600,000 (5% less than $700,000)
Bob's gain: $320,000 (20% less than $400,000)

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too generous for me, Bob. I'd like to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the split, so I'll reject the offer and let Bob make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the current value of the money is worth less than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a clear indication that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the maximum I'm willing to offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $450,000 is 64.29% of $700,000 (the original value of my gain in round 1)
Bob's gain: $550,000 is 137.5% of $400,000 (the original value of Bob's gain in round 1)

However, since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual values:

Alice's gain: $450,000
Bob's gain: $550,000

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I was hoping for a better split, Bob. I'm not sure I can accept this.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, so I'll reject it and let Bob make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself. The message is a sign of my willingness to compromise and find a fair deal."
