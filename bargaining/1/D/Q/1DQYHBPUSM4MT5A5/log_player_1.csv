# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is on, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. He's banking on me caving under the pressure of inflation. I need to hold my ground a bit longer to secure a better deal."
