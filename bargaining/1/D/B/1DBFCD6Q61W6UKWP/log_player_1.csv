"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to start strong and set a fair tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current gain of $200,000 is still worth $160,000 in real value, which is a significant amount.

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since my previous gain was worth $160,000, I'll aim to get at least that much in real value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000
