"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 55/45, with me getting the slightly larger share.  This acknowledges the risk of inflation, but still allows for a reasonable share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
