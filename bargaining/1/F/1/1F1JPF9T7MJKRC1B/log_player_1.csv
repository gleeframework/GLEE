# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 5% less, I'll keep that in mind when considering Bob's offer. With his proposal of an even split, I would get $5000, which is a decent amount but considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round to try to get a more favorable division.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's move on to the next round!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, with the money now worth 36.98% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The difference between our proposed divisions has narrowed substantially, and the risk of losing even more value to inflation outweighs the potential benefits of holding out for a slightly better deal. By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a still-substantial amount of $5050, which, although reduced by inflation, remains a significant gain. It's time to conclude the negotiations and walk away with a reasonable share."
