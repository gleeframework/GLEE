"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going for a strong initial offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money while leaving Bob with a small but still tempting share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant shift from the previous round, and while it's a gain for me, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, reducing my share while still keeping a majority. It's important to demonstrate flexibility while ensuring my gain remains substantial. This should show Bob that I'm open to negotiation but still have a firm grip on the desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm seeing the effects of inflation, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is now significantly more favorable to him, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm decreasing my proposed share again, further demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, I'm aiming to keep the gap between our shares at a significant level. This should encourage Bob to consider accepting before the inflation hurts him more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and with only 6 rounds left, the potential gains are getting smaller and smaller. While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances.  It's time to secure a guaranteed gain rather than risk losing everything."
