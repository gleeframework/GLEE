Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and square.  No need to get greedy! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to think carefully.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for an even split just yet. I want to negotiate for more."

}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."

I'll take the $550,000 and call it a day. It's not the best deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
