"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, and it's a good opportunity to make a deal. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
