"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's not too greedy. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept this offer. While it's true that the money is worth less in each round, I'm still in a strong position. I know Bob wants the majority of the money, and he'll likely keep offering me increasingly smaller amounts. I'm going to wait and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share than in the first round, but it's still a significant amount less than what he offered in the second round.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept before the inflation really starts to hurt my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I'm holding out for a better deal. I believe I can still get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, but still keeping the majority for myself. Inflation is starting to bite, but I think I can still negotiate a favorable deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though my share is decreasing significantly due to inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'm still holding out for a better deal, hoping that Bob will realize that his offer is not very appealing. I'm confident that I can get a better share, especially considering the increasing rate of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm still trying to hold on to a majority of the money, but I'm aware that inflation is really starting to hurt. This offer is slightly lower than the last one, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something before the inflation eats away at his share too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting me hard, I am still in a better position than Bob. I'm hoping to get a larger share in the next round as the pressure of time and inflation will eventually lead to a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm still holding on to as much of the money as possible. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a reasonable share and avoiding a situation where we both get nothing. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, as inflation has made my share worth significantly less. However, considering Bob's offer and the fact that we are running out of rounds, accepting this deal is the best option for me. It ensures that I get at least something and avoids the risk of us both getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
