Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, how about this split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 5% with each round. In Round 1, I offered a 55-45 split in my favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered the same split but in his favor, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money.
Given that the money's value decreases by 5% each round, and we are in Round 3, the total value of the money is now 100 * (0.95)^2 = 90.25 dollars.

### Step 3: Determine a new offer.
Considering the decrease in value and the need to make an attractive offer to Bob while maximizing my gain, I will adjust my offer. Aiming for a slightly more favorable split than the last round but acknowledging the decreasing value, I'll offer a 52-48 split in my favor. This split is closer to equal but still acknowledges the game's progression and the value decrease.

### Step 4: Formulate the message.
Given the adjusted offer, the message should convey a sense of compromise and urgency due to the inflation factor. The message should encourage Bob to accept this offer before the money's value decreases further.

### Step 5: Prepare the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the steps above, the offer should be formatted as follows:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's compromise before it's too late, and inflation takes more of our money.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's compromise before it's too late, and inflation takes more of our money.""}"
