"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total amount for the first round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal for a 50/50 split. However, I'd like to adjust the offer slightly to account for the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 50/50 split, but I'd like to adjust the offer to account for the inflation. Let me counter with a 55/45 split in my favor.""
}
```

In this counteroffer, I'm suggesting that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the decreasing value of the money. This way, I'll get a bit more now and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
