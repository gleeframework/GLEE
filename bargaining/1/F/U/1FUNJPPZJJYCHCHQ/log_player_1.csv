"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose taking 99% of the money and giving Bob 1% to ensure he'll accept my offer.  This is a high offer, as I'll be the one proposing next round if he refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a bad deal for me. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I am still getting a much lower amount than the previous round. I will reject the offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I will offer Bob 10% of the money. While my share is decreasing due to inflation, I believe this is a good compromise.  Bob will be getting a much larger percentage than last round, and I still have a strong position to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Although his share is decreasing due to inflation, I'm still losing a significant amount compared to the previous round.  I'll try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 70%, but I'm still confident that Bob will accept.  He's losing more money due to inflation than I am, and this is a better deal for him than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal. While I'm getting a much lower percentage than my initial offer, Bob is also receiving a significantly lower amount due to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome for me."
