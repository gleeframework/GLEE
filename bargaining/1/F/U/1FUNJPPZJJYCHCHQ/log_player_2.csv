"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a terrible offer, and Bob should definitely reject it. Even with the inflation, 10,000 dollars is a pittance compared to 990,000.  Bob needs to try and get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is still a bad deal for Bob, even with the inflation, Bob is getting significantly less than Alice.  Bob needs to try and get a deal closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should still reject this offer.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split,  Bob is still getting a significantly worse deal.  Bob needs to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 
``` 
This is a fair offer, and the time is getting short.  It's time for Bob to offer a 50/50 split and see if Alice will accept."
