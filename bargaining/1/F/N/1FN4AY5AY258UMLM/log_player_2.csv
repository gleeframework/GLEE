Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have thought of that earlier, I'm still taking more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is heavily skewed in Alice's favor due to the inflation mechanism.  While she loses nothing each round, Bob's potential gains shrink significantly.  

Even though the offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed against me. By continuing to reject, I'm hoping to pressure Alice into offering a more reasonable split to avoid her own potential losses (time is technically a cost for her too). 

It's a risky strategy, but the alternative is accepting a deal where I consistently lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay, let's try this again.  I'm willing to be generous, but I need a deal that makes sense for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a strong position:** While Bob is losing value due to inflation, backing down significantly will only encourage Alice to push further. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** A slight increase in Alice's share shows flexibility but still maintains a reasonable stance against the unfair inflation.
* **Direct communication:**  The message directly addresses the need for a mutually beneficial deal, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness (or at least, her desire to end the game with a gain)."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous by not taking more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Current offer:** 44 for me (effectively worth much less), 56 for Alice.
* **Trend:** Alice is barely budging, highlighting the power of her no-inflation position.
* **Future rounds:** My bargaining power rapidly diminishes. Even if I hold out for a 50/50 split, the inflation will mean I lose significantly.

**Decision:**

It's time to cut my losses.  

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 44/56 split now avoids the risk of even worse offers in future rounds where inflation eats further into my potential gains.  This highlights a key lesson: even in seemingly simple negotiations, external factors can heavily influence the outcome."
