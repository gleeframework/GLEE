"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though the offer seems fair, it's advantageous to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round. There's a chance she might offer more to secure the deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, let's see if you accept this!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial offer, and I have no way of knowing how much the inflation will affect her in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money."
