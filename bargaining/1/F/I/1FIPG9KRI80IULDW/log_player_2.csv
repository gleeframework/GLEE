"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. Take this offer and we both win something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me each round, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. We both get an equal share, and we can walk away happy.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I think it's a fair and reasonable split. Since the money is worth 10% less to me each round, I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing, Bob.  Let's be realistic. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, even though the money is worth 19% less to me now, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is not significantly better than her first one, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try to get a larger share. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice. This offer is closer to what you want, but still gives me a decent share. Let's end this before the value drops further.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I'm trying to find a middle ground that Alice will accept. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I'm willing to give up a bit more to reach a deal. I hope Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept!"
