"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more equitable.  Let's close this out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our two offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, she's benefiting significantly from the inflation working in her favor.  It's still worthwhile for me to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The rate of inflation is working against Alice, but it's not impacting my returns. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a nearly even split at this stage is better than risking nothing as we get closer to the deadline."
