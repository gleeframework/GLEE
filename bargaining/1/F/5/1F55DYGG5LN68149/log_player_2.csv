"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can always negotiate more in later rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal. Bring on the next round!"
