"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it leaves Bob with something to consider. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I still have 11 rounds to try to get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor and Bob might be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal for him in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal. Bob is losing a lot of value with each round, so I think he might be more willing to accept a slightly lower offer."
