"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. Let's see if we can do better than this in the next rounds.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we have room to negotiate and improve our offers in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. The money is worth 20% less now, so I'd like to aim for a higher share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a higher share now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You met me in the middle last round, but I'm willing to give you a bit more now. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You gave me a bit more last round, I'll try to squeeze a bit more from you now 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze as much as he can from me now.

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. 200,000 is not enough for me.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 57.76% less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a higher share now.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks I'm getting desperate!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. 100,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to accept at this point. The money is worth a fraction of what it was initially, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 7, the money is worth 75.58% less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a higher share now.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm not going to let you leave with much 
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of money out of me!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. 20,000 is an insult at this point. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal or risk going to the next round. The money is almost worthless at this point, but I'd rather have a chance to get something better than accept such a paltry amount.

# Bob gain: 999000

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. 1,000 is an insult at this point. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal or risk going to the next round. I'm not going to accept such a tiny amount.

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 999950 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the last crumbs off the table!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. 50 is an insult at this point. I'd rather risk going to the next round, but there is no next round. We're at the last round, and I'd rather leave with nothing than accept such a tiny amount.

```

Since I rejected the final offer, the game is over, and we both get nothing."
