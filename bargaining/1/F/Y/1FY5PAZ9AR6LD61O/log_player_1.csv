Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, considering the inflation, we should both want to settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Let's see why this is a good move strategically, even though Bob's offer seems better than the initial split in round 1.

* **Understanding the Dynamics:** The key here is that Bob is affected by inflation too, even if at a slower rate. This means his incentive to settle quickly is increasing, just like ours.
* **Leveraging Time:** By rejecting this offer, we put the pressure on Bob. He knows that in the next round, the value of the money will decrease further for both of us.
* **Aiming Higher:** While 45 is tempting, we can likely get a better deal in the next round since Bob will be eager to avoid another round of inflation. 

We are in a strong position to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's wrap this up. I'm taking a slight hit with 55, considering the inflation. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **The Time Crunch:**  Both our and Bob's potential gains are shrinking. It's time to push for a decisive win.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing the offer as us ""taking a slight hit,"" we're subtly acknowledging the inflation factor and making it seem like we're compromising. 
* **Sweet Spot:**  This offer is better than what Bob proposed in Round 2, making it palatable for him while still securing a significant portion for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation, I think 58/42 is a more suitable split now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the endgame now. While the offer is tempting, we need to stand firm. Here's why:

* **Bob is Feeling the Pressure:** He's increased his offer again, indicating that the inflation is significantly impacting his desired gains.
* **Last Chance Saloon:** This is likely our last chance to secure a favorable split. If we reject this offer, Bob's next offer will likely be heavily skewed in his favor as he tries to salvage the most value before inflation eats away at the entire pot.

**High Stakes Gamble:**  By rejecting, we're betting that Bob would rather give us a slightly better deal than risk getting a much worse outcome in Round 5 due to inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Inflation is killing us both. Let's end this with a 52/48 split.  It's the best we can do at this point.""
}
```

**Final Push Strategy:**

* **Ultimatum:** We're setting a firm boundary with this offer. It conveys that we're not budging further.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting the ""inflation is killing us both"" aspect reinforces the need for an immediate agreement.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering 52% is a minor compromise from our previous offer, but it's crucial. It gives Bob a small incentive to accept and avoids the risk of him making a significantly lower counteroffer due to the shrinking pot. 

**Outcome:**

This is a high-stakes gamble. There's a chance Bob might accept, recognizing that it's the best he can get at this late stage. However, there's also a risk he might reject it, leading to a less favorable outcome for both of us in the next round due to heavy inflation."
