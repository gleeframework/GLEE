"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40:60 is a fairer split. It's not too bad for me, and you'll still get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
