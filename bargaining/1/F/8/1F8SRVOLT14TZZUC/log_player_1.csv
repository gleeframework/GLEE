"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000 for him and 300,000 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I need to consider that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share again, but I'm willing to think about it...

However, I notice that Bob's offer is not a significant improvement from his previous offer, and I'm starting to think that he's trying to wear me down.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to take a stronger stance."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 650,000 for him and 350,000 for me, I'll try to counter with an even stronger offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for an even higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down. I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer and concede!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle on the lower end. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I need to consider that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share again, but I'm starting to think that Bob is getting more desperate.

However, I also think that Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I want to push for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer, and it seems like I'll end up with $400,000. Not a bad outcome, considering the game is getting more aggressive!"
