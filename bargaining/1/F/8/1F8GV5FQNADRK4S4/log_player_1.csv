Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer: 90/10. It's a tough one, but considering the inflation, it's the best we can both get at this point. Let's be smart and accept this, or we risk getting nothing at all.

It's painful, but at this point, accepting is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of my share has eroded significantly. Waiting any longer means risking getting even less. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has consistently aimed for an extremely favorable split. It's unlikely he'll offer anything close to reasonable in the remaining rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $10 is a tiny share, it's still better than getting $0 if we both continue to be stubborn."
