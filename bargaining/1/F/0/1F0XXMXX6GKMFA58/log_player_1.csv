I'm going for a pretty generous offer in the first round, hoping to secure a good portion of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a much smaller share than I proposed in the first round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to get back some of the ground I lost in the last round. I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. Hopefully, he'll realize that the money will be worth less with every round and will be willing to accept this offer."
