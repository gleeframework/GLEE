"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is mirroring my previous offer, but with the roles reversed. I'm not sure if he's trying to trick me or if he's genuinely willing to accept the same terms.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, and I'm not sure how much it's worth for Bob, I'll try to be more aggressive this time.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering you $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
