"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all in yet. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since it's worth less to me due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much yet.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than his previous offer, but still maintains a decent buffer for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Considering the inflation rate, Bob's offer is worth even less to me now, so I'll need to be more cautious. However, I don't want to get stuck with a very small share of the pie.

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's still a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
