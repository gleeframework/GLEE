"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and we can go from there.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but only if you agree to give me the first 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a interesting twist with the inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer. However, I'm not sure about giving him the first $5000 upfront. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with giving you the first $5000 upfront. Can you offer a different proposal?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, considering the inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation. I'll consider it carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I accept your offer. I'll take $5200 and you can have $4800.""
