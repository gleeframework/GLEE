"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll get a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me 80 dollars and Bob 20 dollars. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair split, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 60/40.  I think that's a better compromise than 80/20. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60/40 is still too skewed towards you, I want a better deal""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will come up with a more favorable offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing again, and I need to think strategically.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of money. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair and balanced split."
