Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5700

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is working in my favor. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to bet she'll be more agreeable in the next couple of rounds as the inflation eats further into her potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a straight 50/50 split. This is the most logical choice considering the circumstances.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and while Alice is getting hurt more by the inflation, it's time to secure a reasonable deal. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous at this stage, but it shows I'm serious about ending the game and prevents the risk of walking away with nothing if negotiations drag on."
