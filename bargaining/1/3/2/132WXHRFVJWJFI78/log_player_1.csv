"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n### I offered Bob $40 and asked him to accept $60 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a bit more for myself. This is still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer of $45 for myself. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The inflation isn't too bad yet, so I'm willing to take the risk. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI've decided to make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'm effectively offering him a bit more than before, while still trying to get a good deal for myself. Fingers crossed he'll agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think Bob's offer of $48 for myself is reasonable at this point. The money is already worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and if we keep going, we'll both end up with even less. I don't want to risk getting nothing, so I'll accept Bob's offer and settle for $48. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing!"
