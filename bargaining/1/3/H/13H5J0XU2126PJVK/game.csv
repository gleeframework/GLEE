50.0,50.0,Let's start fair.  50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to begin.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money. I'll be generous and take 60.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your perspective, Bob. But I think a 55/45 split is a fairer reflection of our time and the value of the money. Let's avoid a stalemate and come to an agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, this is a good deal. You're losing value with each round, let's wrap this up.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,I'm willing to compromise further. A 53/47 split gives you a decent share while still accounting for the inflation affecting me.  Let's reach an agreement before we both lose more.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
44.0,56.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is fair considering the inflation. Take it before it's too late!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, we're both losing money.  This is my final offer. A 51/49 split is the closest we can get to a fair compromise given the inflation.  Accept it, or we risk losing everything.",Alice,7,
