I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering we both have an equal chance of being the proposer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  While Bob's offer was tempting, I believe a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something."
