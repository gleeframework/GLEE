Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are running out of time. This offer is a compromise, and it ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at the value. Let's be sensible and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, time is running out. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I receive a reasonable amount, even with the impact of inflation. Rejecting carries significant risk:

* **Further Rounds:** Alice's offers are unlikely to improve significantly.  
* **Inflation:** Each round diminishes the value, making future gains less appealing even if I get a larger percentage.
* **Failure:** We risk walking away with nothing if we can't agree.

This offer guarantees a decent payout in the face of a ticking clock."
