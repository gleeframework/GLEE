"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still think in terms of the original $100. But for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so he's offering me $55 and himself $45.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to take it. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
