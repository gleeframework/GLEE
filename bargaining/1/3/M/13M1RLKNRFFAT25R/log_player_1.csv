"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, knowing that Bob has a steeper discount with each round. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, rather than risk losing a larger share of the money later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take something, it's still a massive loss for me compared to my initial proposal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds, especially given the steeper discount Bob faces with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, taking into account Bob's strong counter-proposal. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I proposed, and the inflation is starting to really hit his side. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially as the rounds progress and his share decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to adjust my offer, offering a slightly smaller share to Bob but still aiming for a significantly larger portion for myself. The increasing inflation is clearly working in my favor, and I'm confident Bob will eventually accept a deal closer to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not good enough for me.  I'm holding out for a larger share, especially as the inflation is dramatically affecting his potential gains.  I think I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to acknowledge the pressure of the increasing rounds. However, I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I believe he's getting closer to accepting my proposal."
