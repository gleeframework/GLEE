Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm proposing to keep the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I propose I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's more fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's better to take the $5,000 than risk getting nothing in the next round."
