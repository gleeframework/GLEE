I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see how Bob responds."

# Bob gain: 999999

I'll reject this offer. I'm not going to let Bob get away with such a lopsided split."

I'm still going for a big chunk, but I'll offer Bob a little more this time to see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  We're back to a very lopsided split, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. We've both rejected offers that were very uneven, so this seems like a fair compromise."
