 I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 Bob is being greedy.  While I'm losing some value, I'm still not willing to accept a 40/60 split in his favor.  I'll propose a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it's still a more fair deal than Bob's.  Given the inflation, I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
