"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, and Bob will get 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving me a good enough deal, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You can't fool me, I'm taking a bigger share this time!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more reasonable now that the money is worth less.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the 50/50 split, as it's a fair compromise and the money is worth significantly less than it was at the start. I'm hoping to get out of this negotiation with a decent share."
