"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving 10% for Bob. It's a fair starting point, and I believe it's a good strategy to try and secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly less in my favor due to the inflation, I reject it. This is a clear sign that he is trying to exploit the inflation to gain more, and I will not allow it. I'll make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but acknowledging the inflation and Bob's assertiveness.  72 for me and 28 for Bob is a fair compromise, considering the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I refuse to accept such a meager amount, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again. Bob's unwillingness to budge is making me realize that a more balanced division might be necessary to reach an agreement. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but still leaves me with a decent portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is a bit better than the last round, I still refuse. The inflation has significantly eroded my potential gain, and I'm determined to secure a more equitable share. I'm not giving in to Bob's aggressive negotiating tactics just yet. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

At this point, the inflation has taken a significant toll on my potential gain. I'm realizing that the best strategy is to prioritize securing any amount of money over trying to maintain a large share.  This 50/50 split ensures that I get something, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
