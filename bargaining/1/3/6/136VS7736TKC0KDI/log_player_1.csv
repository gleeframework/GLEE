"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you can have 40""}

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob takes 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 50 and you can have 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, 50% of the initial 100$ is 50, which is a decent offer considering the reduced value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
