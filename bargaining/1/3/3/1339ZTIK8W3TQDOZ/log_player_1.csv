"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the value of the money decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the values are now $9,000 in total.

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after two rounds, the current total is $9,000. Considering the decreasing value, I'll make a more aggressive offer to secure a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think this is a good opportunity to get a larger share before the value drops further""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. The value keeps decreasing, and I think it's best to secure a fair deal before it drops further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth 63.1% of its original value, so the current total is $6,310.

I'm not sure if an even split is the best option, considering the value is still decreasing rapidly. However, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed 50/50 split.
