"Round 1

Round 2

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. This offer still gets you a decent amount considering the inflation hitting your share harder. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth is hurting you more than me. Let's settle this now and both get something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While getting only $40 after 5 rounds stings, it's better than accepting a deal where Alice gets the lion's share. I need to show her I'm serious and willing to risk it for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on.  Waiting any longer significantly risks getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for Bob. 
* **Fairness Card:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm calling Alice's bluff on being ""fair."" It puts the pressure on her to accept a reasonable deal."
