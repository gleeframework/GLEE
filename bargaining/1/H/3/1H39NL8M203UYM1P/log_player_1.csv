"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I want to see how Bob reacts. If he rejects, it will give me a better understanding of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll accept."
