Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, aiming to get the most possible for myself while still giving Bob something to consider.  It's a risky move, but the early rounds are crucial for setting the tone.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and reasonable, especially considering the potential for inflation. Accepting ensures I get half the money, which is a good outcome.  It's best to avoid unnecessary risk, and this seems like a safe and stable solution."
