"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good share. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm going to reject it.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal later, especially since the money is losing value faster for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference this time, Alice.  I'm feeling generous, but I need a bigger share to make this worth my while.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. My offer is still generous, take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While the offer is still slightly less than what I proposed, the money is losing value rapidly. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
