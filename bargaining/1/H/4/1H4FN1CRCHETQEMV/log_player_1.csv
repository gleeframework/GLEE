"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering we're just starting out. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'd rather not give up so much of the initial amount.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 40% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than giving up 80% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better next time.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than giving up 80% of the remaining value."
