"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant gain. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer.""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the inflation impact on both of us and adjusted the offer to better reflect a compromise, while also considering the devaluation of money as the rounds progress. This offer aims to be more balanced, giving both parties a significant share while acknowledging the risk of further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Alice's side, and the risk of further devaluation, I believe this offer is reasonable. It's slightly better than the initial offer, and given the circumstances, I'm inclined to accept and secure the deal rather than risking further losses."
