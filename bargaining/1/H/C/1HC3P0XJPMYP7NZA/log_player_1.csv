"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the offer.

In the second round, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original value, which is $4,000. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is $4,750.

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to compromise to move forward."
