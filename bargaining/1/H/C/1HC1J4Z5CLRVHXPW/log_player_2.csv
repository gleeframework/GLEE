Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Let's settle on this. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is less than what I offered in the previous round, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money for me. It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
