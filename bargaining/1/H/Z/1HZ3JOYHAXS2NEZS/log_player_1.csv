"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a higher percentage, but 60-40 is still too skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30-70 split. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm pleased to see that Bob is willing to compromise further! I think the 52.5-47.5 split is a fair and reasonable offer. I accept this offer and we can finally divide the $10,000."
