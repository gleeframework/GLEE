"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're both starting from scratch. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
