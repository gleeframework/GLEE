"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can be friends!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a friendly offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This offer is more balanced, and we can still both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,700. 

In this round, Bob's offer is for me to gain $4,000, which is worth $3,800 after inflation.

I'm not sure if this is the most I can get, but I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a more balanced proposal.
