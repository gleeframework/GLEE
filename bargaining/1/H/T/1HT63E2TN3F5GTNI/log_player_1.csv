"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept a small amount just to get something. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being just as aggressive as I was! I'm not going to let him get away with this.  I'll make my own offer next round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm dropping my offer a bit, but still keeping a majority.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both being stubborn and start negotiating seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a dangerous game. He's not going to get away with this!  I'm sticking to my guns.  Let's see if he'll come around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Okay, I've had enough of this back and forth. It's time to compromise. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair, and it's the best way to ensure we both get something. Let's see if Bob will finally agree."
