"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90 and give $10 to Bob. This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I believe it's important to establish a strong position early in the game. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept 40% of the money, I still believe I can get a better deal. With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing with every round. I'll try to hold out for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose taking $60 and giving $40 to Bob.  Since Bob rejected my first offer and then offered a significantly less favorable deal, I'm willing to concede some ground. I'm aiming for a more balanced split, but still seeking to gain a majority of the remaining money.  With inflation impacting the value of the money, I want to make sure I get a fair share before it's worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept something,  20% is a far cry from what I initially proposed. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and I think it's time to settle for a fair compromise.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the money is losing value quickly, 10% is simply not enough for me. I'll risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I propose taking $40 and giving $60 to Bob. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to start accepting compromises to avoid getting nothing at all. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it gives him a significant share and avoids the risk of us both losing everything."
