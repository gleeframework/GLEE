"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This way, we both get a decent amount and can still negotiate further in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original amount.

I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best deal for me. I'll think about it and make a counteroffer next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $8,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take a bit more than before:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still looking for a good deal. Your turn to decide!""
}
```"
