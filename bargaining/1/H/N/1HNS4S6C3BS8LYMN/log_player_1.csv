"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, it's a fair and simple proposal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which seems like a reasonable and straightforward way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight advantage to start, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a slight advantage, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less for me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation, but still leaving room for a decent split""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a balance between fairness and my own gain 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'll have to be even more careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a decent offer. I'll take what I can get at this point.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope to do better in future rounds."
