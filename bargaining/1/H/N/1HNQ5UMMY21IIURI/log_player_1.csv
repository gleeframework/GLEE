"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split to start. It seems fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Although it's not a drastic change from the first round, I'm not willing to settle for less than half, especially with inflation now factoring in. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a slight adjustment to the 50/50 split, with me taking 45 and Bob taking 55. This is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation factor and allows for a more equitable division."
