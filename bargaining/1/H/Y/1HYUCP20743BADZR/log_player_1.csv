"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money closer to 50/50.  Let's start with 60 for me and 40 for you.  We can still negotiate further in the coming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
