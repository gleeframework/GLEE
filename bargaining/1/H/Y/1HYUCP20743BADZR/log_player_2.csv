"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90 and you get 10, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's better to reject and see if Alice will offer more in the next round. There's a good chance she'll compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think it's more fair to split the money closer to 50/50.  Let's start with 60 for me and 40 for you.  We can still negotiate further in the coming rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? This is a fair split considering the inflation, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for Bob, considering the inflation is now affecting Alice's share significantly. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a decent amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
