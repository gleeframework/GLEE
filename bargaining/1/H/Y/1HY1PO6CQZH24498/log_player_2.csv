"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my share of the money. While a 400,000$ gain is nice, I can likely do better by rejecting and seeing what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a more favorable split for me.  Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hurt my gains, I'm still getting a significant amount (450,000).  It's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal, especially considering the risk of further inflation."
