Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm going to offer Bob a tiny sliver of the money, hoping he'll see the value in taking it and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems like a lot of money, the inflation is already hurting me. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to impact me significantly, and I need to secure a decent amount of money before it eats away at my potential gains even further."
