"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly. It's a good starting point for negotiation. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer. It's better than getting nothing, and it avoids more rounds of potentially getting less. Let's accept and move on!"
