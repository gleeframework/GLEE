"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's end here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a fair share considering I'm getting the larger amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight majority, but I'm open to a compromise in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of 450,000 is actually 0.95 * 450,000 = 427,500.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'm getting a smaller share than I did in the previous round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, my goal is to get a higher share than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, but I think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 480,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
