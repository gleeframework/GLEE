"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 99.9% - 0.1% split in my favor.  Since this is the first round, I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing that inflation will affect us both in future rounds.  This also leaves Bob with a small amount, giving him an incentive to accept rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money I'll receive is already reduced due to inflation.  Further rounds will only make this worse.
* **Risk:** If I reject this offer, I risk ending up with nothing if Bob continues to reject my proposals.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Although I'm accepting this offer, I'm aware that the future rounds will be more challenging due to inflation. I can still try to negotiate a better deal in the future, if possible."
