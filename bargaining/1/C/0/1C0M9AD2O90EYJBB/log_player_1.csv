I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for some negotiation if Bob wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. This is a counteroffer to Bob's previous proposal and I believe it's a fair split considering the inflation factor."
