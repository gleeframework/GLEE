Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60 for her, I'll try to counter with a slightly lower amount for her. Here's my offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Alice's offer is still heavily skewed towards her, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50}"
