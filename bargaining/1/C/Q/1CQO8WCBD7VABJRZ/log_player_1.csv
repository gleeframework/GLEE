"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while ensuring I get a majority. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, Bob's proposal is fair and gives us both an equal share. With inflation, continuing to negotiate will only diminish our gains."
