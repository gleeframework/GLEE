Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that my potential gains are diminishing, but I still believe holding out for a slightly better deal is worthwhile. Accepting $4,400 now feels too much like letting Alice take advantage of the situation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's split this right down the middle.  It's the fairest option and avoids further losses for both of us.""}

# Alice's message: Your money is losing value fast, take it! 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The relentless march of inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. While this isn't a perfect deal, accepting $4,600 is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing in the later rounds."
