Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to give you more than before, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's work together to make sure we both get something out of this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, so she's likely betting on me caving to get a somewhat reasonable amount. I need to push for a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to secure a decent amount to make this worthwhile for me. Let's make this a win-win situation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is claiming to meet halfway, the inflation difference means she's still getting a much better deal even with a 60/40 split. I need to hold firm and make it clear that a fair deal considering the shrinking pot is crucial.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and she needs to start taking the devaluation more seriously."

""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  We're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with every round. My offer is a bit above a 50/50 split to compensate for the inflation difference. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal.""
