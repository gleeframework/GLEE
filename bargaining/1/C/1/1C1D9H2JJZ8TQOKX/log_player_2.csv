"Round 1

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it, let's try again 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take advantage, even after Bob made what he called his ""final offer.""  This suggests she might be willing to go even closer to a 50/50 split as the rounds progress and the pressure of losing everything increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic. This is a good deal for both of us. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the halfway point of the game, so it's time to start applying real pressure.  Bob is moving a little closer to Alice's desired split but making it clear this is his serious offer. The message is designed to convey firmness and urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced, you're going to have to do better than that 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly stalling, hoping Bob will cave in to her demands.  Her offers are creeping up slowly, indicating a willingness to negotiate, but she's still trying to maintain an advantage. Bob should hold firm for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Take it and we both win, or reject it and we both get nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the law. This offer is slightly in Bob's favor but still very reasonable.  By framing it as a ""final offer"" and emphasizing the risk of getting nothing, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to accept. This is a calculated risk, but at this stage of the game, a strong stance is necessary."
