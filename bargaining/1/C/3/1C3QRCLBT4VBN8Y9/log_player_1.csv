"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split.  Let's divide the money 51/49 in my favor. This ensures a fair distribution, considering the potential inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
