I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%.  I figure since I'm the first to propose, I should try to grab a large chunk of the pie.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is playing hardball! I'm not going to accept this offer.  My share is worth significantly less due to inflation.  It's my turn to propose, and I'll try to strike a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

Okay, I'm taking into account the inflation and trying to be a bit more reasonable. I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's still a significant share, but hopefully, it's fair enough for Bob to accept.  Let's see how this goes!"
