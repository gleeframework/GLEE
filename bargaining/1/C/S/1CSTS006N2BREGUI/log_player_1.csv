"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor.  I think this is fair as it gives Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially since the money is losing value with each round. I'll counter with a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000:300,000 split.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a decent share for myself. The inflation is starting to bite, and I can't afford to lose too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is really hurting my potential gains. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. The inflation is getting out of control, and I need to secure a decent amount before it eats away any more of my potential winnings. This is a fair and balanced solution, and I hope Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply unacceptable.  Even with the inflation, I am not willing to accept such a small portion. I need to fight for a more equitable share, or we will both lose out completely."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm proposing a 400,000:600,000 split. While the inflation is taking a toll, I'm still aiming for a reasonable share.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  The inflation is eroding my potential gains, but I'm not going to accept such a disproportionate split.  I'll try one more time to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm proposing a 300,000:700,000 split. This is the best I can do with the inflation severely impacting my share. It's a compromise, but I need to secure at least some of the money.  Let's hope Bob sees reason and accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant portion of the money, the inflation has made it a very small amount for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

This is my last offer. Inflation has ravaged the potential gains, and I need to secure *something* before it's all gone.  This offer still gives Bob the majority, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is insultingly low. Even with the inflation, I would rather get nothing at all than accept such a meager sum.  We both lose, but I refuse to be taken advantage of in this way."
