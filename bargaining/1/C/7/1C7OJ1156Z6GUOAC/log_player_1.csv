{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly.  It's a high offer for Bob, but I want to ensure he sees the value in accepting early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I know that the next round I can offer a more favorable split for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still offering a significant gain to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept, as the value of the money will decrease further for me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject Bob's offer. I understand the pressure is mounting as the rounds pass and the value of the money diminishes.  But I believe we can still find a better deal for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, hoping to find a compromise.  This is a significant amount for Bob, and I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting it.  The next round will be even more challenging for me with the increasing inflation, so I'm hoping to reach a resolution now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the dwindling value of my gains, I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  I believe we can reach a more equitable split, and I'm prepared to negotiate further.  This offer is still too heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to settle for such a lopsided deal.  I'm confident we can find a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm dropping my share a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a decent amount.  The inflation is taking a toll, but I'm hoping this offer is enough to convince Bob to accept. It's a fair deal considering the value of the money to me is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still rejecting Bob's offer. While the pressure is mounting, I'm holding out for a better deal. I believe that in the next round, I can propose a more equitable split that is beneficial to both of us. I am confident that we can find a better outcome if we continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share one last time. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to find a middle ground to avoid getting nothing at all.  This offer is still generous considering the diminishing value of the money for me, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the need to reach a compromise."
