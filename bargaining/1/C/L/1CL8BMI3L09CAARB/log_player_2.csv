Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, inflation is hurting me! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, don't push me too far 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can push for a slightly better split in the next round.  Each round that passes gives me more leverage due to the asymmetric impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a generous offer considering the circumstances.  Don't let pride push you into an even worse outcome. Take the deal!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to maximize my gain while ensuring Alice accepts. Offering 60/40 is a strong move at this stage:

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  Alice is losing significant value each round. This offer might be the last where she gets anything close to a ""fair"" share in her eyes.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Framing the offer as ""generous"" and urging her not to let ""pride"" hurt her plays into potential psychological factors in her decision-making. 
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  Pushing too far (e.g., demanding 70 or more) risks making Alice dig in her heels, even if it means a worse outcome.  This offer balances greed and the need to close the deal."
