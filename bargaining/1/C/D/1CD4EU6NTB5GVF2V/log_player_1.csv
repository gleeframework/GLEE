"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take it all! Are you really going to let me have it all?""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping to catch Bob off guard and get the best deal for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Splitting the money evenly seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Maybe Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I'm not sure if I'm being too generous!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself while still giving Bob a decent share of the money."
