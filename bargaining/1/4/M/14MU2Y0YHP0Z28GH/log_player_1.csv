"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'll try to do better in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better split this time, but still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

I'll think carefully about this offer. While it's not ideal, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
