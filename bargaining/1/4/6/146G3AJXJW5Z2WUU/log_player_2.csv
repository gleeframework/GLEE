Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a more equitable split. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Delaying further significantly erodes the value, especially for Alice. 
* **Fairness:** While I'd prefer my 60/40 split, 450,000 is still a significant sum, and Alice's offer shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds, and the longer we wait, the less we both get."
