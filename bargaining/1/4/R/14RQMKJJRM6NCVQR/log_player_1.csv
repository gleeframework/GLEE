"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. This is a high risk, high reward strategy. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have a chance to adjust in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the safest option. With inflation, the money is worth less each round, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
