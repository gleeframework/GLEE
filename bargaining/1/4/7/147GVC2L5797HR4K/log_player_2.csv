Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the game's dynamics.  Since the value of money decreases with each round, rejecting this offer gives me the chance to potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  This offers a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in later rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it still favors her significantly.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more equitable division. The decreasing value of the money for me in later rounds motivates me to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  We both lose value with each round, so it's in our best interest to agree now.""}
