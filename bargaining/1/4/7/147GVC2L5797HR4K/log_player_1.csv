"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a fair division. Since the money loses value over time, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid losing even more value in future rounds. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split.  This offers a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with this offer, as I think 45% is too low for me. Since the money loses value over time, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Since the money is losing value, I'm hoping Bob will accept this deal to avoid losing even more in future rounds. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  We both lose value with each round, so it's in our best interest to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a fair offer, considering the money is losing value rapidly. Accepting this deal now will give me a better outcome than risking further rounds and potentially losing even more value. It's time to settle and take the offer!"
