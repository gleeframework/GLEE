Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good share considering the inflation, and we can wrap this up now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'll be forced to take even less next round just to break even.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. You'll lose even more if you wait. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing 59.04% inflation. This means his potential gains are rapidly diminishing with each round.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting any longer will likely result in Alice offering even less in a future round, knowing Bob is desperate to settle before the inflation eats away his share.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob at least 50% of the original amount. Rejecting carries a significant risk of getting a worse deal or even nothing. 

While not ideal, accepting the 50/50 split cuts Bob's losses and prevents the situation from deteriorating further."
