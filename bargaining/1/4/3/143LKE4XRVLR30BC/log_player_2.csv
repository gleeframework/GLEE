Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair given the inflation and the fact that we're both taking a loss. Let's end this game and get our money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

## Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. However, the devaluation is much steeper for Alice (20% per round) than for Bob (5% per round).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob risks getting an even lower amount in subsequent rounds. While he could potentially propose a slightly better split in Round 4, there's no guarantee Alice would accept, and the value would continue to decrease.
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, evidenced by her willingness to compromise from a 60/40 to a 55/45 split. It's unlikely she'll move much further in Bob's favor.

**In conclusion, while 4500 is less than Bob's initial goal, accepting the offer in Round 3 secures a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation.**
