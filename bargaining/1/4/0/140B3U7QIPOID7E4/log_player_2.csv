"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out something more even later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see if Alice is willing to compromise more in the later rounds, especially since the money will be worth less for Bob with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split this time. Let's work together to ensure we both get a decent share before the value of the money starts to decline.""}
