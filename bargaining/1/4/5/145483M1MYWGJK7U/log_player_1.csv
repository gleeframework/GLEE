"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's a fair and simple way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already kicking in!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll think about the new value of the amounts.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't want to split it evenly. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still leave you with a decent share. Your turn to decide.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a good chunk for myself too.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll consider Bob's offer. With the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.727 = 8231.46 (approximately)
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.727 = 5503.19 (approximately)

I'll think about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the offer. It's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds."
