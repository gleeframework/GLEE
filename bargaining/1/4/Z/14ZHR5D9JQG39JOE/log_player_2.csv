Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about getting anything at all.  This is my last attempt to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is better than Alice's previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The rate of inflation is hurting me quickly, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a huge chunk of the potential gain, even considering the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and my patience (and money!) are wearing thin. This is my final offer. You either accept a reasonable split now, or we both lose out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value I'm losing with each round is significant. Offering a 60/40 split is a strong move to try and force Alice's hand. It shows I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal but also willing to walk away if she continues being unreasonable.  It's a risky move, but the alternative is potentially getting an even worse deal in later rounds or even getting nothing at all."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money here. This is a fair split considering the situation.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with less than half the rounds remaining and inflation eating away at my potential gains, accepting is the safer option. While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, there's a high risk that Alice won't budge further, and I'll be left with a much smaller amount or even nothing.  A 30/70 split isn't ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
