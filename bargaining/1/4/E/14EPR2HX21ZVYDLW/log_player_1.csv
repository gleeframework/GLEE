"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money I gain is still worth $800,000, and the money Bob gains is worth $550,000.

I accept Bob's offer.
