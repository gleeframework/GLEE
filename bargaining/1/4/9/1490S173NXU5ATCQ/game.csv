450000.0,550000.0,I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement before inflation takes a bite out of our gains.,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split feels more equitable considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's try to reach an agreement before things get worse.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution considering the inflation we're both facing.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to ensure we both maximize our gains.,Bob,4,
