I'm going for a slightly unfair split, but I think it's a good starting point. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept even a small share, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept this offer. While it's fair in terms of switching roles, I'm going to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split this time.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and we can end the game."
