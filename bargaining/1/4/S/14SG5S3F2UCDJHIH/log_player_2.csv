"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a bit early to accept, given that I'll get a better offer in the next round.  Let's see what Alice proposes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split.  Since we're both losing value on our money with each round, I think it's best to find a solution sooner rather than later.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest option and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While a 50/50 split is a bit better for Alice, the inflation means that my gain would be less and less with each round.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money before the inflation gets too out of control."
