{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us if we settle now.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 55% and you take 45%.  Given the inflation, it's a better deal for you than the last round. Let's not let this go on any longer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could push for more in future rounds, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is a smart move. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. However, my value remains the same. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal, and we could end up with a much smaller amount if the negotiations drag on.
* **Fair Deal:** 45% is a respectable share, and it's a significant improvement over her initial offer. 

Accepting now secures a good portion of the money and avoids potential losses due to prolonged negotiations.
