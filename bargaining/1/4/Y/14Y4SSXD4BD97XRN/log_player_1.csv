"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: $300,000 x 0.95 = $285,000 (since Alice's gain is worth 5% less)
Bob's gain: $700,000 x 0.8 = $560,000 (since Bob's gain is worth 20% less)

I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise, especially considering the significant difference in the values. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 5% less than in the previous round. So, the effective value of the money is now 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original amount.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $200,000 x 0.85 (since Alice's gain is worth 14.26% less) = $170,000
Bob's gain: $800,000 x 0.51 (since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less) = $408,000

I'm not sure if this is a fair compromise, considering the significant difference in the values. However, I'm running out of time, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer.
