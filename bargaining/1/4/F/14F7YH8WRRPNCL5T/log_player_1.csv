"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 450,000 dollars and keep 550,000 for myself. I believe this is a reasonable and fair split, considering we're trying to find a mutually agreeable division. I'm hoping Bob will see it this way and we can end the game here to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the offer you just rejected. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because it's the same split I offered in the previous round, but due to inflation, the money is now worth 5% less. If I didn't think 450,000 was enough for me in the previous round, I shouldn't accept it now when it's worth even less. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob 475,000 dollars and keep 525,000 for myself. Given the impact of inflation, this offer is slightly more generous than my initial proposal but still recognizes that each round decreases the value of the money. I'm trying to find a balance that appeals to Bob while considering the devaluing effect of inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but the deal has to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered me 475,000 dollars, which is the same amount I offered him in the previous round but with the roles reversed. Given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, accepting this offer now would be more beneficial than potentially receiving a smaller share in future rounds. It seems like we're meeting closer to the middle as proposed, and accepting this could be the fairest outcome considering the circumstances. Proceeding further risks losing more value to inflation, so I'll accept this offer."
