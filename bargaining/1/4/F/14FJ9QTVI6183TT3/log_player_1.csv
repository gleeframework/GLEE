Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I am keeping a larger share, but I believe it is fair considering the inflation rate will hurt Bob more than me in later rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation rate. Accepting this offer means I get a decent amount of money, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
