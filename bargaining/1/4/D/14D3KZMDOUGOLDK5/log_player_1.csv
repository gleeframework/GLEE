"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since this is the first round and the inflation effect is minimal, I'm aiming for a large portion of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. While I understand that inflation is a factor, a 1000/9000 split is far too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm proposing a 7200/2800 split. The inflation is starting to bite, but I still want a fair share of the money. I'm willing to compromise a bit more than my first offer, but I need to ensure I get the majority."
