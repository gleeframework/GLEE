"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 dollars and take 80. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  I think that's the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars.

I'm not sure I want to split the money evenly, as I'd rather have a slightly higher share. But I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about an even split. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in the third round, my gain of 55 dollars is actually worth 55 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 48.45 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60 dollars, and you can have the rest. It's a good compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
