"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I believe this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round. With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm actually getting less value than the numbers suggest, so I want to aim for a higher amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know my response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Getting anxious, let's settle""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to $700,000 and decreasing Bob's share to $300,000. The message ""Getting anxious, let's settle"" is intended to convey a sense of urgency and a desire to end the game, which might prompt Bob to accept the offer. Considering the inflation, I'm trying to maximize my gain, but I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer, so I'm prepared for the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer - let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer since the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. The offer seems relatively fair, considering the circumstances, and Bob's message suggests that he's not willing to negotiate further. I'd rather take the $550,000 now than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know my response.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###"
