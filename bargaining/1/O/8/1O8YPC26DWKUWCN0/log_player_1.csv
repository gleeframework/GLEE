Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob likes a 60/40 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 50/50 split. It's better than nothing, and with the inflation, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round."
