"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take into account the inflation, so I'm offering you 40, and keeping 60 for myself. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I was expecting a more generous offer from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a fairer share considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm reducing my gain slightly to 45, but still trying to get a decent share considering the inflation."
