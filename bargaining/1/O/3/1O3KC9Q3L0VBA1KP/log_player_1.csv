I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller portion to avoid further rounds.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much better deal for Bob, but it's still not a good one for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a small portion, especially with the inflation penalty.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground. Bob's offer was too low, but I'm willing to give him a larger share than my initial proposal.  Let's see if he'll accept this."
