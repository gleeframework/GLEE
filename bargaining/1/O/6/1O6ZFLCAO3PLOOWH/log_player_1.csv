I propose we split the money 9000/1000 in my favor. I figure that's a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a split of 7000/3000 in my favor.  This is a compromise from my last offer and I hope it's more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hitting hard.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing."
