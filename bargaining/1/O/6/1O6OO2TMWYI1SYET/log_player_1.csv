"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money and giving Bob 10%. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm trying to maximize my share while still offering Bob something to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing money each round due to inflation, it's still better to reject and potentially get more in the next round.  Bob's offer is drastically in his favor, and I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, giving Bob a larger share than before but still keeping a majority.  Since Bob rejected my initial offer and is now facing inflation on his gains, I believe this offer is more likely to be accepted."
