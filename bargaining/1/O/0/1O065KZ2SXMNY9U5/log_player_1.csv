"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a good chunk!""}\n\nMy offer is 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. I've included a message to persuade him that it's a good deal. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, 500,000 in this round is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Given that we're in the early stages of the game, I believe there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal, especially since I started with a higher offer. Let's see how it goes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the impact of inflation, my next offer will take into account the devalued amount from the previous rounds. I'll aim for a slightly more favorable division than before but still offer Bob a considerable share to encourage acceptance.

### {""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust and move forward!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, this offer takes inflation into account. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of 400,000 to me and 600,000 to himself seems less favorable, especially considering the value depreciation over time. Since we are still relatively early in the game, I'm inclined to push for a better deal in the next round, hoping to leverage the decreasing value to negotiate a more advantageous split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","As we're getting deeper into the game with increasing inflation, it's essential to factor in the diminishing value of the money. In this round, I'll adjust my offer to ensure it reflects the current economic state while still presenting Bob with a reasonable share to consider acceptance.

### {""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's adapt to the inflation and settle!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, let's avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation, where the money's value has decreased by 40.95% from the first round, Bob's offer seems more reasonable. The difference in our gains is 100,000, which, when adjusted for inflation, represents a much smaller actual value than it would have in the initial rounds. Given Bob's message that this is his final offer and the increasing devaluation of the money, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision to avoid further losses from inflation and ensure we both receive a share of the money before it devalues further."
