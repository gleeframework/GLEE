"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, my gain of $300,000 is worth only $270,000 (90% of $300,000).

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
