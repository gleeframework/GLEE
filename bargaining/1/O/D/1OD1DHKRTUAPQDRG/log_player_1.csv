"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 20%. This way, we can both have a decent amount to start with, and then we can negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

My gain in this round is 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 (since my gain in the first round was 8000, and it's worth 20% less now).

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.
