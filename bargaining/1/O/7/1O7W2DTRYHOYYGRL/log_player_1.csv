"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get a better deal now that it's his turn to propose.

I'll think for a moment... Since the money I gain is still worth the same, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going into another round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
