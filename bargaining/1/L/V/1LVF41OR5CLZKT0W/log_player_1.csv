"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly before inflation kicks in!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll be eager to close the deal and avoid losing value due to inflation. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to close the deal quickly, but your offer wasn't fair. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
