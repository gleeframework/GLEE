"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far less generous than my initial proposal.  Even with the 20% inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  Let's see if we can reach a more equitable solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for inflation and Bob's counter-proposal. I'm offering $720,000 for myself and $280,000 for Bob. This should be a fair compromise that considers both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still significantly less than what I would have accepted in the first round. I'm holding out for a more equitable split. Even with the inflation, I believe there is still room for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

Given the ongoing inflation and Bob's stubbornness, I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself but still trying to reach a compromise. This ensures we both get a significant portion of the money while acknowledging the loss due to inflation."
