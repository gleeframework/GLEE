"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer to divide the $100, considering the impact of inflation on both players.
Given the rules, it's strategic to start with an offer that seems fair but slightly biased towards me, Alice, since Bob loses more value each round.

### Step 2: Calculate the exact amounts for the proposal.
I will propose that I take 55% of the $100, which is $55, and Bob takes the remaining 45%, which is $45.

### Step 3: Formulate a message to accompany the proposal.
The message should encourage Bob to accept the offer by highlighting the benefits of accepting early, given the increasing devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.

### Step 4: Construct the proposal in the specified JSON format.
The proposal will include my gain, Bob's gain, and the message to Bob.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Accept now and save more; each round reduces the money's value!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split this time. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer considering the impact of inflation on both players.
Given the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split needs to be recalculated to understand its true value in this round.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted values of the offer considering inflation.
For me, Alice, the money is worth 5% less than in round 1. So, the $45 offered is actually worth $42.75 in round 1 terms.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so his $55 is actually worth $49.50 in round 1 terms.

### Step 3: Assess the fairness and strategic value of the offer.
Considering the adjusted values, Bob's offer seems less favorable, especially since the gap in the perceived value of money increases with each round, to my disadvantage more so than Bob's.

### Step 4: Decide on accepting or rejecting the offer based on strategic considerations.
Given the decreasing value of money and the strategic advantage of making the next offer, it might be beneficial to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that leverages the increasing pressure of inflation on Bob's potential gains.

### Step 5: Formulate the decision in the required format.
Based on the strategic analysis, the decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Consider the impact of inflation on the value of money for both players in Round 3.
For me, Alice, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's worth 10% less than in Round 1.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's worth 20% less than in Round 1.

### Step 2: Adjust the initial offer to account for the decreased value of money.
Given the increasing impact of inflation, I should adjust my offer to make it more appealing for Bob to accept now rather than risking further devaluation.

### Step 3: Calculate the new proposed division of the $100.
Considering the strategic need to make an attractive offer while also benefiting from the previous rejection, I propose a 52-48 split, with me taking $52 and Bob taking $48.

### Step 4: Formulate a message to accompany the proposal, emphasizing the urgency due to inflation.
The message will highlight the significant loss of value for both of us if we continue to the next rounds and the mutual benefit of accepting this offer.

### Step 5: Construct the proposal in the specified JSON format.
The proposal includes the adjusted amounts for me and Bob, along with a persuasive message to accept the offer.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is biting hard; let's settle now before it gets worse!""
}
```"
