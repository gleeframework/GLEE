Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'll take a slight majority, and you still get a sizable chunk. This deal makes sense for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
