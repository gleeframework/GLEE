"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the risk of inflation. It's a better deal for you than the last round, and I'm willing to share more than half. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
