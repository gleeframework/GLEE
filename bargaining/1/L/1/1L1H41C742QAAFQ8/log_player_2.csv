Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, the deal won't get better for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, I still have time on my side. Accepting a 40/60 split now is too desperate. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. I need to hold out for a better deal and hope she starts feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, how about a slight advantage for you?  We need to agree soon!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, my offer is getting worse 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing a mental game, claiming her offer is getting worse. In reality, she's just increasing the pressure. While the inflation is hurting, accepting a 38/62 split sets a dangerous precedent. I need to show some backbone and hope she starts making genuine concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We both lose if we don't agree now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time is running out. While not ideal, this offer is the closest I can go without getting a significantly raw deal due to inflation. By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping to signal I'm serious and put the pressure on Alice.  It's a gamble, but waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing at all."
