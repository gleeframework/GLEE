I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, trying to get the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a significant amount of money, I know that if I reject it, I'll be able to make the next proposal and likely get a much better deal.  The inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting Bob, so I need to try to negotiate a better outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time.  Since I'm the one proposing, I want to ensure I get a fair share, but I also don't want to push Bob too far and risk him rejecting the offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, as the inflation has been hitting me hard.  While I'd prefer a more even split,  I'm realizing that the value of money is rapidly diminishing.  Accepting this offer will at least give me a substantial amount of money, which will be worth a lot less if we keep going through rounds.  I'm taking the risk and accepting it."
