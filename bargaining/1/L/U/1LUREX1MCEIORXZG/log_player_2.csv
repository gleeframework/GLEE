Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle-ish 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation is becoming very real for me.  It's time to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, otherwise, the deal won't be worth it as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping.  Let's be realistic and split this closer to even.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is killing my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting even less later.  Alice knows time is on her side, and she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this point."
