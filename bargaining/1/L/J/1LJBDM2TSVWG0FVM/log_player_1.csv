"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to keep $9000 and give $1000 to Bob.  I want to secure a large portion of the money as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a much worse deal for me than the previous round, even though the money is worth less for Bob. I need to try and secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I think this is still a good deal for me. Since Bob is losing value on his money faster than me, it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me than my previous offers.  He's losing value faster than me, so he should be willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I believe this is still a fair offer considering Bob's decreasing purchasing power. I'm hoping he sees the value in accepting this offer before it's too late for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very bad for me. The money he gains is worth significantly less than in the first round. I believe I can still secure a larger share by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I'm hoping Bob realizes the value of securing some money before the inflation rate makes this offer even less appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I need to be compensated for the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, considering the inflation that has been impacting Bob's share significantly. I hope he recognizes that this is the best outcome for both of us at this point."
