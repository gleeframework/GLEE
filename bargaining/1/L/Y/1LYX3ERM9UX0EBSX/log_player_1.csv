"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. This seems like a fair and straightforward way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll pass on this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, where I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and accept a smaller share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I was hoping for a better deal, but Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing. I'm not thrilled about getting only 40 dollars, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still more than the 30 dollars I would have gotten in the previous round. Plus, Bob is giving me a bigger share than before, which shows that he's willing to compromise. I'll take the deal and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
