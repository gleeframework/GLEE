"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer,  keeping 95% for myself and giving Bob only 5%.  Since we have 12 rounds, I want to try to secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. The inflation is a big risk, and I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is. Taking 40% now is a decent outcome."
