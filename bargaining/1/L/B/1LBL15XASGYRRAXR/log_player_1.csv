"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair shot, but I'm not giving away too much. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll be getting $5000, which is 83.33% of the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.
