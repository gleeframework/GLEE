60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, 55-45 is still quite fair considering we're in this together.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. I'll take my previous offer of $55, you get $45.  It's a fair deal considering time is working against us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I'm willing to take a bit more risk. 58-42 is my new offer. The longer we wait, the less we'll both get.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the point where the deal is not worth it. I'm coming down to $52, leaving you with $48.  Let's be smart and take this before inflation eats away even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm not backing down. 60-40 is my new offer. We're running out of time, but I think I can get a better deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your stubbornness. I'm proposing a simple even split: $50 for you, $50 for me. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time!",Alice,7,
