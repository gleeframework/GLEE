"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 4:1""}

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 and Bob receives 200,000. I think this is a fair split, considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Equal division seems fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the equal division, but considering the diminishing value of money, Bob's proposal is a reasonable one.
