Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite greedy. Let's be reasonable - I take the larger share as I'm making the first move, but we both benefit greatly from ending this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
