"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a larger share, but you still get something.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
