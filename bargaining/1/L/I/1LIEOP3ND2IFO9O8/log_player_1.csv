"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective gain for me in this round is 54 (60 * 0.9).

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit better for me than my original proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
