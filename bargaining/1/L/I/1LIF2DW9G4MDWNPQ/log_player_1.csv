"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, to see if Bob will accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I need some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 70/30 split, especially since I don't know how much the inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best of me, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split, trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains, but I'll have to think about this one carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my end. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the increasing inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 85/15 split, trying to get a better deal for myself before the money becomes even less valuable due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting desperate yet 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the 75/25 split, as it's a relatively better deal considering the inflation and the fact that I don't know how Bob perceives the value of money. I'll take what I can get at this point."
