"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,800. Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $3,800.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a bit better than the previous one. I'll accept it for now.
