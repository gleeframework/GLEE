"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This gives you a decent share and avoids us both losing out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's risky to accept such a low share in the first round.  There's a good chance I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my last offer was already generous. This is the best I can do - take it or leave it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is really starting to hurt.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking losing even more in the next round."
