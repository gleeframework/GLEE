"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the lion's share, but it's still a generous offer, considering it's the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth less, but I still have to consider the offer. Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation is still in effect, my offer will be worth even less. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split Bob proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering Bob's new offer, I think I should accept it. The difference between our gains is still significant, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
