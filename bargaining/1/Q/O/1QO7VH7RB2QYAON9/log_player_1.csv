"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting a guaranteed amount rather than risking a lower offer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'll reject this offer. Your proposal of splitting it evenly is a bit too generous for my taste, considering the inflation factor. I'd rather wait for a more favorable offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better offer than before, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the last time I'm offering an even split, Alice. I'm not going to keep losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I'll take this one. With the inflation factor eating away at the value of the money, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
