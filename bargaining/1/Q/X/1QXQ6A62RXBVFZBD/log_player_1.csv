"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 4000 I would gain in this round is worth 95% of what 5000 would have been in the first round, which is 3800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not getting a great deal, but I'll consider it. Since I rejected his previous offer, I'm not in a great bargaining position, so I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a slightly better deal than my previous offer, but I still feel like I'm giving up too much. I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer.
