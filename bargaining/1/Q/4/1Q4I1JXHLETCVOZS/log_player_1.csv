"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was rejected, so now it's my turn again.

However, I notice that Bob's offer in Round 2 is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
