"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly biased offer, but it's still generous! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is biased towards himself, I'm not thrilled about it. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
