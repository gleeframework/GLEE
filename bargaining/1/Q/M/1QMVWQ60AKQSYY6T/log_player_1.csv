Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about losing more money with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
