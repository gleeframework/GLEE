Alice's offer:

This is a risky move, but with 12 rounds and a 20% inflation rate per round, it's worth trying to get a better deal.  The initial offer is significantly unbalanced, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all in the later rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still quite lopsided, even with the inflation. It's worth pushing for a more even split, as there are still many rounds left, and the inflation will continue to impact the value of the money."

Round 4

I'm offering Alice a slightly larger share, but still a significant increase from the previous round.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fairer split.  The inflation will continue to pressure Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal before it becomes too late."
