"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
