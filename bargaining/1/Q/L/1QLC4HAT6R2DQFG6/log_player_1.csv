I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of being rejected. This way, Bob still gets a decent portion, and I have a good starting point.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me a larger share than I initially proposed, it's still significantly less than what I would have received in the first round. I'm willing to take the risk of another round and potentially get a better deal. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so I think he might be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm lowering my desired gain slightly to 5500, which is still a substantial amount given the inflation. This should be more attractive to Bob as he's feeling the effects of inflation more heavily.  I believe this offer is fair, and hopefully, he'll accept it."
