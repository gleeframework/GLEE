Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, but I still want a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice continues to push for a larger share, even with the increasing inflation.  While time is a factor, accepting a bad deal will leave me with significantly less. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a more equitable split."

Round 7

# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The effects of inflation are becoming severe. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable split than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
