I propose to keep $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
``` 
I propose to keep $750,000 and give Bob $250,000. This is a more balanced offer, and I'm willing to compromise a bit to get this deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer.  While I understand the inflation impact, Bob's offer feels too lopsided. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still hoping for a fair split. I'm offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob.  We need to come to an agreement soon, as the inflation is really impacting us both."
