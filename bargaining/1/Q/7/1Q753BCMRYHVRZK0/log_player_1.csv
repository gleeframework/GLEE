"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair but generous split.  I'll take 90%, and you get the remaining 10%. It's a good start!""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50% and leave the rest for you. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I prefer to get more money, the inflation is a significant factor.  In round 1, I was hoping to get 9000, but now, due to inflation, I'll only get 7200.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me 5000, which is better than the inflated value of my previous offer."
