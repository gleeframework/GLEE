"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1900.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting a relatively small share, I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.
