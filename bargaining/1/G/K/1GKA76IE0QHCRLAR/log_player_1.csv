"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the fairness in it and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles this round. I think we can both be happy with this split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a toll on the money's value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to continue the game if it's not going to get me more than 4000 dollars. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
