"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4,000 and keeping 6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time! I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  Fair's fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's sudden change of heart. I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not buying the 60-40 split. I'll make a new offer: 55-45 in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You can't handle the truth! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 55-45 in my favor, as I mentioned in my previous message."
