"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I would gain $3,000, which is still worth $3,000, and Bob would gain $7,000, which is worth $6,300.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was for $7,000 to him and $3,000 to me, and I rejected it, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This way, I'm gaining a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4,000 is still worth $4,000.
Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth $6,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273 inflation) = $4,362.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's last offer was for $4,000 to me and $6,000 to him, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm gaining a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
