"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. Considering that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is a good compromise for me, especially considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise given the inflation.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up!

Considering that the money is now worth significantly less for both of us, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer. With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to be cautious.

However, since Bob is meeting me halfway, I'll consider this a relatively fair offer. I'll accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of our wealth due to inflation.
