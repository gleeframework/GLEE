"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, the offer from Bob is equivalent to me gaining $36 (40 * 0.9) and Bob gaining $48 (60 * 0.8).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
