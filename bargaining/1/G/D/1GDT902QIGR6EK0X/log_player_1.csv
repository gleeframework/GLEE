"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I propose to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. This feels like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of getting the better end of the deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, given the inflation, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
