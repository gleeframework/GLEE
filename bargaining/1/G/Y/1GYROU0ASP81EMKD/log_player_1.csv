Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a very generous offer considering I have a much higher inflation rate than Bob. Let's get this over with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially since my inflation rate is significantly higher."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and get a slightly better deal than Bob's offer, but still be reasonable to avoid further rounds.  70/30 feels like a good balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not good for me, as I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation. I'm still confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a 60/40 split, hoping that it's enough to convince Bob to take the deal. With each passing round, my inflation rate is making this game increasingly unfavorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too unfavorable for me. Despite the higher inflation rate, I'm not willing to accept this huge loss. I'll see if I can secure a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this time.  I'm losing a lot of money with each round, and I need to reach an agreement quickly.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair and reasonable offer."
