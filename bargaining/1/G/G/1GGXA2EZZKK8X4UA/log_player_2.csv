Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too lopsided. Let's try a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent amount even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
