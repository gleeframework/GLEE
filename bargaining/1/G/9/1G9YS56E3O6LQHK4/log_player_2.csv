"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we divide the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject Alice's offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially knowing inflation is a factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a slightly more even split. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've decided to propose an equal split since Bob didn't find my previous offer satisfactory. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. While inflation is a factor, an equal split is a fair outcome, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to reject offers."
