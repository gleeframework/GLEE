This offer is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the rapid inflation affecting his gains.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

This is a tough one, but accepting is the most logical choice now. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting rapidly for both of us, especially for Bob. It's getting to the point where even a 60/40 split in my favor might be worse than a 50/50 split just a couple of rounds later.
* **Time:** We are already past the halfway point.  Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, and he might be less likely to offer a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds. 

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal at the start, it's the most rational decision considering the circumstances and the risk of getting nothing at all."
