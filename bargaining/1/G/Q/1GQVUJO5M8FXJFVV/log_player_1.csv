"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to maximize my share, but I need to keep Bob engaged for the next few rounds so I can gauge his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round. While it's not ideal, accepting it allows me to lock in a good share of the money. It's also a good opportunity to learn more about Bob's negotiation style and what he's willing to accept."
