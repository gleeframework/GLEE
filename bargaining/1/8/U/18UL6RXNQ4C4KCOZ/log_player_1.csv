Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer is fair considering the inflation we both face. Accept it, and we can both walk away with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it might seem ""fair"" considering the inflation,  it's still a significant drop for me from the previous round. I believe I can get a better deal with more rounds to play."
