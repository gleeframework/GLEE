"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'd rather get 49 than 50. I'll accept this offer.
