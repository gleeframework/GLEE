"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is 50/50, it's a relatively fair split considering the reduced value. I'll accept this offer.
