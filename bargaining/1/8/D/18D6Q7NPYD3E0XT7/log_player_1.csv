Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly.  I'll take 55, and you can have 45.  This is a fair deal for both of us, and it's a good way to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
