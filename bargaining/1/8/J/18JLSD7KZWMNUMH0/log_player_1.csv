"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to get it over with.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk too. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $250,000 I'd gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $225,000. Meanwhile, Bob's $750,000 is still worth $750,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but it's a decent offer considering the inflation.
