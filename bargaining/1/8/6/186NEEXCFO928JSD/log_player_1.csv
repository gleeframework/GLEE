"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting the effort I put in to rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he deserves a bigger share for rejecting my initial offer.

I'll reject his counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's now my turn to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
