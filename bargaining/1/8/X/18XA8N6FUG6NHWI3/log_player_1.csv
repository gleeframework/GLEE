I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time, aiming to find a compromise."
