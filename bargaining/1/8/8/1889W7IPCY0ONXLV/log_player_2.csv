"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. You know I'm going to take most of the money anyway. This offer is the most you're getting.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  I'm feeling generous, but we both know time is money. This offer is more than you'd get if you wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's clear she's trying to leverage the time pressure against me. I need to show her I'm willing to risk further inflation for a more equitable split."
