Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a majority share for me this round, reflecting that the clock is ticking and inflation hurts me more. This offer ensures you still receive a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
