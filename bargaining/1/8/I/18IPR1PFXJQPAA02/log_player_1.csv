"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate much, let's just get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm keeping it simple and straightforward, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 70 is still a bit too much. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $70 in the second round is actually worth 95% of the original $60 I proposed in the first round, which is $57. So, in real terms, I'm being offered $57.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still a bit lower than my original proposal. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my offer is worth 90% of the original amount due to inflation, so I'll aim for a slightly lower share to account for the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 65 is still a bit too high. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this offer. Since the money I gain in this round is worth 14.26% less than the original $60, it's worth approximately $51.69.

Considering this, I'm being offered $65, which is still a bit higher than the value I'd get from my original proposal in the first round. However, I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since I could potentially get more in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my offer is worth 14.26% less than the original $60, which is approximately $51.69. I'll aim to get a bit more than this to account for the decreased value of money.
