"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53 (approximately)
* Bob's gain: $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79 (approximately)

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to get a better deal.
