I'm going for a large share initially, but leaving some for Bob to avoid immediate rejection. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is significantly smaller, it's better than getting nothing in the next round due to the inflation. It's also important to remember that Bob's offer reflects the current value of the money, and his share remains the same."
