"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your offer was unfair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced split considering the inflation we're facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, my offer is still generous. Take it before the money loses more value 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  Any further delays only hurt me more than you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, delays hurt you more. But I'm not going to split it evenly. This is my final offer, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, the deal is getting significantly worse with each round. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $3900 is better than risking an even lower offer in subsequent rounds."
