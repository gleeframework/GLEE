70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I propose you take $30, and I take $70. It's a good offer for you right now, considering the inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll come down to $65, leaving you with $35.  Every round that passes costs you more than it does me.  It's time to make a deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'm sticking to my previous proposal.  We both need to compromise, but I'm not willing to take less than 70. Let's agree to a 70/30 split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value of your share is plummeting! I'm offering you $40, which is more than the $30 you were offered in the first round.  Take the deal before it's worth even less!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,I'm not budging.  I'm taking 80% of the money. You're running out of time and the value of my share is shrinking. This is my final offer.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but your stubbornness is working against both of us.  I'll give you $45.  Take it before it's worth even less! This is getting dangerously close to the wire!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
10.0,90.0,This is it. I'm taking 90% of the money.  You're running out of time and the value of my share is rapidly declining. It's your last chance to accept before we both get nothing.,Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is insane!  We're down to the wire and you're being completely unreasonable.  I'm offering a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, because this is my final offer!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
5.0,95.0,"I'm taking 95% of the money.  You're out of time and the value of my share is shrinking rapidly. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both get nothing.",Bob,10,
