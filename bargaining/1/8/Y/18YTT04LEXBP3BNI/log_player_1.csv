It's painful, but at this point, rejecting Bob's offer means we both get nothing.  While it's a terrible deal, it's better to take the $5 than to walk away empty-handed.  Bob has played a risky game, but ultimately, his stubbornness has paid off (even if the actual value he gains is far less than what he initially demanded)."
