"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk too!""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4000
