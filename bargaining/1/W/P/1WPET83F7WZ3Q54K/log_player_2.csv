Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm compromising. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases substantially.  We are already at round 5 of 12, and the money is worth significantly less than at the start.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively better for Bob. If the trend continues and Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice's next offer might be even less favorable.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, they risk running out of rounds and getting nothing at all.

This offer is still skewed in Alice's favor, but the time pressure makes it too risky to hold out for a significantly better deal."
