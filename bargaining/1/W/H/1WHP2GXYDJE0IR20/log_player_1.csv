**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money has decreased by almost half. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the potential gains for both players.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for Alice. It's unlikely he'll offer anything better in Round 5.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of getting even less in the next round, with no guarantee of a better deal.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
