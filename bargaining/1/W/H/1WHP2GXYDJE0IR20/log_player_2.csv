Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the next round's inflation!""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see that it's better to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risking a worse deal in the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a better deal than you'll get in round 4! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Don't risk another round!""}\n\nI'm trying to put pressure on Alice, implying that she won't get a better deal if she rejects this offer. Fingers crossed!"
