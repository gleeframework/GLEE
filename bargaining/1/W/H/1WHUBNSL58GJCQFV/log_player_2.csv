I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, it's very low.  I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject. Alice is getting greedy!  I know inflation is hitting her harder than me, but I'm still going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get more than 2000 in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000} 
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bigger share this time. Even with inflation, I think I can get a decent deal.  Let's see if she'll take it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting better, and I don't want to risk losing everything.  Inflation is hitting her hard, and I don't want to push her too far.  4000 is a good deal for me, and I think it's worth taking."
