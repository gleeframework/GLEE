"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10, I'll take the bigger share since I'm making the first offer.  Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure if a 90/10 split is ""fair"" at all.  Let's see if I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It's a more even distribution than your last offer, and still gives you a significant share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split this time. It's fair, and we both get a good amount. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome, especially considering the inflation factor.  Accepting ensures we both get a decent share of the money."
