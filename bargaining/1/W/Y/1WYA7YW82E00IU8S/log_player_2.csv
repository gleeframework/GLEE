"Round 1
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Leverage:** In these early rounds, I have more leverage due to the inflation working against Alice. I want to capitalize on this. 
* **Testing the Waters:** While I rejected Alice's offer, I don't want to drastically change the split and risk her rejecting my offer out of principle.  A slight adjustment tests her willingness to negotiate.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  My message frames the counter-offer as a fair adjustment rather than a complete dismissal of her initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find some middle ground. I'll offer 5750 for me and 4250 for you.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is working in my favor:**  While Alice is trying to inch closer to her initial offer, time is on my side. Each round makes the deal less appealing for her.
* **Holding Strong:** Accepting now would signal that I am willing to settle for less than my Round 2 proposal. I need to show some resolve.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure to reach an agreement. By rejecting this offer, I believe she'll be more open to a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, 
""alice_gain"": 5250, 
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine? That seems like a fair deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm still in a strong position, I recognize the need to move towards a resolution. Offering a split that directly addresses our previous offers makes it appear like a significant concession on my part.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  Despite the concession, my proposed split is still more favorable than her last offer and keeps the pressure on her due to the ongoing inflation.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  Framing the offer as a fair compromise and highlighting its position between our prior offers nudges Alice towards acceptance.  Time is running out for her to secure a reasonable amount."
