"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant portion, but you'll get a decent share. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'll think about it... Since the money is worth 20% less, I'm actually getting $3,200 (4000 * 0.8) and Bob is getting $4,800 (6000 * 0.8).

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
