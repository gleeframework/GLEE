Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, that means it's worth 81% of its original value. 

In the first round, Alice offered 30, which is 30% of 100. To make my offer in the third round, I'll aim for a similar percentage of the current value.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to do better.
