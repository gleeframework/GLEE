"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer that would be fair and enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering the decreasing value of money for him.
Given that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob with each round, the initial offer should be slightly more favorable to him to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds but still aim to maximize my gain as Alice.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer amounts.
A reasonable approach is to offer Bob slightly more than half to incentivize him to accept early and minimize the risk of further devaluation. Let's propose 55% for Bob and 45% for myself, aiming for a quick resolution that benefits both parties.

### Step 3: Formulate the message to accompany the offer.
The message should convey the rationale behind the offer and encourage acceptance by highlighting the mutual benefits of an early agreement. For example, ""Early acceptance benefits both of us by avoiding the devaluation of money in subsequent rounds.""

### Step 4: Compile the offer and message into the required JSON format.
Based on the calculations and considerations, the JSON offer would be:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Early acceptance benefits both of us by avoiding the devaluation of money in subsequent rounds.""
}
```

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Early acceptance benefits both of us by avoiding the devaluation of money in subsequent rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's settle this quickly. I'll take a bit more to account for the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on Bob's offer.
In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for Bob than in the first round. This means if he were to receive the same amount as in the first round, its actual value to him would be less.

### Step 2: Assess the fairness and attractiveness of Bob's offer.
Bob has offered himself 60% and me 40%. Given that the value of money hasn't decreased for me but has for him, this offer seems less favorable to me compared to my initial offer.

### Step 3: Consider the potential outcomes of accepting versus rejecting the offer.
Accepting the offer gives me $40, which is less than my initial proposal but guarantees me a gain. Rejecting it and moving to the next round means I could potentially get a better offer or nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the assessment.
Considering the offer is less favorable to me and there are still 10 rounds left, I decide to reject the offer in hopes of getting a better deal in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Reassess the situation after Bob's offer and my rejection.
Given that Bob's offer was not acceptable and considering the decreasing value of money for him, I need to make an offer that is still favorable to me but also appealing to Bob, taking into account the devaluation he's experiencing.

### Step 2: Calculate the new offer amounts.
Since Bob is experiencing a 10% devaluation each round, his perception of value is decreasing faster than mine. A balanced approach would be to slightly adjust my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still maximizing my gain. Let's propose 52% for Bob and 48% for myself, slightly improving his share to incentivize acceptance.

### Step 3: Formulate the message to accompany the new offer.
The message should acknowledge the previous offer and rejection, while emphasizing the benefits of accepting this new proposal. For example, ""Considering your concerns about devaluation, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to expedite our agreement.""

### Step 4: Compile the new offer and message into the required JSON format.
Based on the reassessment and considerations, the JSON offer would be:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering your concerns about devaluation, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to expedite our agreement.""
}
```

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering your concerns about devaluation, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to expedite our agreement.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's find a middle ground. This offer considers the time pressure and devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on Bob's new offer.
In the fourth round, the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob than in the first round, which means he's experiencing a significant decrease in value.

### Step 2: Assess the fairness and attractiveness of Bob's new offer.
Bob has offered himself 58% and me 42%. Given the increasing devaluation for Bob, this offer seems more balanced than his previous one, as he's trying to find a middle ground.

### Step 3: Consider the potential outcomes of accepting versus rejecting the offer.
Accepting the offer gives me $42, which is still less than my initial proposal but closer to a compromise. Rejecting it and moving to the next round means I could potentially get a better offer, but the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds increases.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the assessment.
Considering the offer is more balanced and the increasing risk of not reaching an agreement, I decide to accept the offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
