"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not a 50/50 split, and I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to 55/45 in my favor, but I'm still open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly better share this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offers are getting closer to mine.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. A 45/55 split is still not ideal, but it's getting closer to my original 50/50 goal, and I'd rather settle for a slightly worse deal than continue negotiating."
