"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60/40, since the money is worth less to me with each round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle a bit.  This offer is still favorable to you considering the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you 30 and taking 70 for myself.  Inflation is hitting me hard, and I need a better deal.  This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the rounds progressing, Bob's offer is getting too greedy. He's bluffing about it being his final offer. We still have rounds to negotiate, and he loses more with each failed round than we do."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 50,

""message"": ""Bob, this isn't going anywhere. We both lose if we don't agree. Let's be practical and split it evenly.""
