"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my turn to make the next proposal and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
