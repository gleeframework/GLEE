"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Let's analyze:

**If I accept:**

* I get $400,000. 
* This is significantly less than my initial offer, and even less considering the 10% inflation hit.

**If I reject:**

* I'm banking on getting a better offer in the next rounds.
* However, Bob's offers might get worse, and the value will keep decreasing.

**Considering:**

*  We are only in Round 2 out of 12. 
* Bob's offer is quite skewed in his favor.
* I need to signal I'm not easily bullied into a bad deal.

**Decision:**
