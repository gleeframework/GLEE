Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than my previous offer, and it's likely she won't give me more in the next round.  I'll take it!"
