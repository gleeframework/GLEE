I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but I want to see how greedy he is!  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair offer. I'll take it!"
