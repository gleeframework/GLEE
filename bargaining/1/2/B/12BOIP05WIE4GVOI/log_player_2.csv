"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. Bob should try to negotiate for a much larger share, especially considering the rapid inflation working against him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's too greedy Alice! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This round only!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Bob needs to immediately counter Alice's unfair offer to set a different tone for the negotiations. 
* **Time Pressure:**  A 60/40 split in Bob's favor is still generous to Alice, but the rapidly decreasing value of the money means Bob needs to secure a good deal quickly. 
* **Urgency in the message:**  By highlighting ""this round only!"" Bob hints at potential for a better deal for Alice in later rounds (if she's willing to negotiate fairly). This might make his offer more palatable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. 60/40 split, but this time in my favor. We can both get a good chunk of the money before inflation hits harder. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is simply trying to mirror her unfair offer from Round 1, taking advantage of the rapidly inflating situation. Bob still has time to negotiate, and accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for the rest of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I'm offering a 55/45 split. Let's be fair to each other and end this before the money shrinks even more!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Bob is moving slightly closer to a middle ground, showing a willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a slight advantage given the inflation working against him. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking value of the money, urging Alice to take the deal before it's too late for both of them.
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  Bob avoids countering with another extreme offer (like his initial 60/40). This shows he's serious about finding a mutually agreeable solution, but won't be walked over."
