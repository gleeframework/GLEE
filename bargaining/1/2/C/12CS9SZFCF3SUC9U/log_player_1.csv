Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a fair split, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob got a better deal this round, it's still more than I would have gotten if we had continued.  I'm happy to take the 40!"
