"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This means I would receive 75$ and you would receive 25$. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, this might be a good offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
