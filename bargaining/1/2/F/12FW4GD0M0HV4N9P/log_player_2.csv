Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go lower than 60 for myself.  It's still a decent split for both of us, and we'll avoid any further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
