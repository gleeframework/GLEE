"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This way, I'll get $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70% share for Bob, even if it's a ""fair split"". I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 70% in the previous round, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last round, now it's my turn to push back!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping $550,000 for myself, which is 55% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but considering the inflation rates, his offer is actually a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to get a better deal, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation and tries to get a better deal for me:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000, which is 52% of the original amount, and keeping $480,000 for myself, which is 48% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, let's finalize the deal! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to finalize the deal, but his offer is actually a 48% share for me, which is a bit less than my previous offer. Considering the inflation, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $520,000, as it's a slightly larger share than my previous offer, and it's a fair deal considering the inflation."
