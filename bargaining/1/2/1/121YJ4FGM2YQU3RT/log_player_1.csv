"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and make a deal quickly. This offer benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage for Alice:** This offer gives Alice a slight advantage, recognizing the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains in future rounds. 
* **Encourages Agreement:** The message emphasizes fairness and the benefits of a swift resolution, making it more appealing for Bob to accept now. 
* **Future Round Consideration:** While Alice could start with a more aggressive offer, this approach balances immediate gain with the risk of Bob rejecting it and proposing something less favorable in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more equal split, but I'm willing to compromise. This offer is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer has simply reversed the amounts from Round 1, putting Alice at a disadvantage. While he acknowledges the inflation, his proposed split doesn't fairly reflect its impact. 
* **Leveraging Inflation:** By rejecting, Alice forces Bob into another round where inflation will further decrease the value of his potential gain. This strengthens Alice's bargaining position.
* **Aim for a Better Deal:**  Alice's initial offer was reasonable. Rejecting this unfavorable counter-offer keeps the possibility of negotiating a more advantageous split in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 515000,
""bob_gain"": 485000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against you. This offer is reasonable and saves us both time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice slightly reduces her initial demand, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still securing a larger share.
* **Inflation Emphasis:** The message again highlights the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains, pressuring him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Balancing Act:** This offer seeks a balance between maximizing Alice's gain and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting before inflation further erodes his share."
