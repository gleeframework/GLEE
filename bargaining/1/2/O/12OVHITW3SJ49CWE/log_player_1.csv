**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us. However, Bob is losing value at twice the rate. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** My previous offers were already pushing for a larger share. Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round risks losing more to inflation than I would gain.
* **Uncertain Outcome:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might become even more desperate and offer a deal significantly worse than this one.

Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable sum, even after accounting for the impact of inflation."
