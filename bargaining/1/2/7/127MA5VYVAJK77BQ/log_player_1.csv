"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It gives me a little more, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll. My gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 55/45 split is indeed a bit more favorable to him. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up more than I initially offered.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a counteroffer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 54/46 is a better split. You get a bit more, but I still get a decent amount. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground."
