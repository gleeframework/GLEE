"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this time, but we can work out a better deal in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, we both get a good amount""}\n\n###\n\nSince it's the first round where I make an offer, I'll try to propose a more balanced split, taking into account that the money's value decreases with each round. I aim for a middle ground to encourage acceptance and avoid further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's try to find a compromise, or we'll both lose a lot more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current offer and considering the impact of inflation on both our gains, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable split. Rejecting this offer allows me to propose a counteroffer in the next round that might better account for the depreciating value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair adjustment. We should settle before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly from the previous round, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation. By proposing a 58/42 split, I aim to find a middle ground that is more acceptable to Alice, given the pressure of the depreciating value of the money for both of us. The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement to avoid further losses."
