"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away the whole pie just yet! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so the total is now $9,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 60-40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $7,000 and keeping the pressure on Bob to give me a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less, so the total is now $7,275. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$10,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $7,275

$7,275 * 0.75 = $5,468.75 (this is the actual amount I'd get in the first round, but due to inflation it's now worth less)

Since the actual amount I'd get is $5,468.75 and the offer is $5,500, I'll accept it.
