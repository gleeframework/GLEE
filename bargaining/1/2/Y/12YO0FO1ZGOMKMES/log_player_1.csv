"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I'm proposing a 990,000 - 10,000 split in my favor. Since the money inflates for you and not for Bob, I'm hoping to get the majority of the money this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. While I'm losing 490,000 from my initial proposal, the inflation would have reduced my share to 792,000 in the next round. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option for me in this situation."
