"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $600,000, while Bob would receive $400,000. The message to Bob is an attempt to frame the proposal as fair, despite it being slightly favorable to me, in hopes that Bob might accept early on to avoid the risk of getting less due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a bit more, but let's be a bit closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because, although it seems more balanced, the inflation has already reduced the value of the money I would gain by 10%. Given the decreasing value of the money for me with each round, I aim to either negotiate a better deal that compensates for this loss in value or wait for an opportunity to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable, considering the inflationary pressure I'm under."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still need a bit more""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly reduced my initial proposal to show willingness to compromise, while also considering the impact of inflation on my gain. The message to Bob aims to convey the urgency and the reasoning behind my proposal, hoping he might accept this offer to avoid further negotiations that could lead to both of us losing out due to the time constraint and the devaluing effect of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is hurting you more than me.  This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's message emphasizing the urgency and the impact of inflation, I decide to reject this offer. The proposed division still doesn't compensate for the significant loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation, which has now reached 27.1% less than the initial value. Given that we are still in the early rounds, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations in hopes of securing a deal that better accounts for the diminishing value of my share. Accepting this offer might be seen as giving in too early, considering the potential for further negotiation and the time left before the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, but I'm still willing to find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this offer, I've again slightly adjusted my proposal downwards to demonstrate a willingness to find a compromise that both parties can accept. The message to Bob acknowledges the increasing pressure of inflation but also emphasizes my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. By doing so, I aim to keep the negotiations open and avoid a stalemate, while also trying to secure the best possible deal under the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this soon.  This offer gives you a slight advantage considering inflation. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this stage, considering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by nearly 41%, I decide to accept Bob's offer. The proposed division of $510,000 for me and $490,000 for Bob, although not ideal, starts to look more favorable under the current circumstances. Bob's message suggests a willingness to settle and acknowledges the effect of inflation, which indicates a level of understanding and compromise. Given the decreasing value of the money and the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to ensure a guaranteed, albeit reduced, gain."
