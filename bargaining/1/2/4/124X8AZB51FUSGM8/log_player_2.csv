# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. My offer stands, but your potential gains are dwindling. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

My potential gains are shrinking quickly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's end this now."
