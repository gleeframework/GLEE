Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's get this done before the inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one! While the offer is still tilted in Alice's favor, it's getting dangerously close to the point where waiting another round would be detrimental for me (Bob). 

* **Accepting:**  45 dollars is better than any potential deal I could hope to get in round 4 after inflation eats away at the value. 

* **Rejecting:** Risks getting an even worse deal in round 4 due to inflation. Alice knows this and might propose something worse, banking on my desperation.

**Conclusion:**  It's a gamble either way, but it's probably safer to accept and cut my losses at this point."
