"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this round, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for me due to inflation, but Bob's gain is worth slightly less than in the first round.

I'll think about it... Considering that Bob is taking a larger share this round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me this round, I'll try to take a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm being generous""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 75%, you can have the rest, but it's getting late 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Considering that the money is worth significantly less for me this round, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since Bob is taking a very large share this round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better than 25% this round, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
