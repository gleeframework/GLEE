"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'm considering Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which might be a fairer deal considering the reduced value of the money."
