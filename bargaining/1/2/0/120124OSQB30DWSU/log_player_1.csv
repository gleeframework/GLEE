Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I propose taking 810,000 for myself and giving Bob 190,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting the impact of inflation. However, it still offers Bob a greater share than he would have received in round 2, after the inflation adjustment."
