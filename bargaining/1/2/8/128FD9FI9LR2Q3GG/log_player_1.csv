Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split than 80/20, considering we're starting from the same amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
