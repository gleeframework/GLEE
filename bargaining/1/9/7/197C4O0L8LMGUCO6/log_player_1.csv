"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  I'll take 60% and you can keep 40%,  let's move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's call it a compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still keep a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  It's fair considering the inflation, and I'm not willing to give up more.  Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to wrap up the negotiations and get a guaranteed 51.2% of the remaining value, rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal."
