"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, let's be more realistic. I propose a 48/52 split.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  It's crucial to reach a deal quickly. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to both of us, although the impact is worse for me.
* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. While a perfectly equal split isn't realistic in this scenario, a slight adjustment towards a more balanced division is necessary.
* **Urgency:** By offering a slightly better deal for Alice than her initial offer (considering the 10% inflation she experiences this round), I'm hoping to incentivize her to accept and avoid further value loss for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging!  While she's technically offering a ""compromise"", the change is negligible considering the money is losing value fast. I need to push for a more serious offer.  Waiting any longer is significantly hurting my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This is eating into both of our gains. I'm proposing 47/53. It's a decent deal considering the circumstances - let's close this out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Time is the enemy! By round 4, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money. It's crucial to get Alice to agree to a deal *now*.
* **Concession:** I'm offering a slightly better deal than my previous one, acknowledging the time pressure.  
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes the shared loss from inflation, promoting a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a rational decision. 
* **Realism:** While I'd prefer a larger share, realistically, I need to offer something that Alice might actually accept to avoid reaching an even worse outcome in later rounds."
