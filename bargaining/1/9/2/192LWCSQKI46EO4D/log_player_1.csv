"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. I'll consider the fact that Bob is offering a slightly skewed split in his favor, but I'll have to weigh that against the fact that the money is worth less overall.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to balance it out. I'll have to consider whether this is a good time to accept a more even split.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine attempt to balance it out or just a way to get me to accept a slightly skewed split. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

However, I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me into accepting a worse deal than I would have gotten in earlier rounds. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.
