"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that we're at the beginning of the game and I don't know how Bob will react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 95% of the original amount, and the money Bob gains is worth 80% of the original amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. In this round, the money I gain is worth 90.25% of the original amount (95% of 95%), and the money Bob gains is worth 76% of the original amount (80% of 95%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
