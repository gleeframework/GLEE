"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to consider the offer.\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's response?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases quickly for me. This offer accounts for the depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the value of the money decreases for both of us, his proposed split doesn't quite balance out the depreciation difference between us. I believe there's room for further negotiation.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering depreciation""}\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's response?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering depreciation""}\n\nAs previously calculated, I'm sticking with the same offer from the last round, taking into account the depreciation of the money's value for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable adjustment.\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's response?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer to split somewhat evenly while considering the fast-approaching deadline. 
# Alice gain: 495000 
# Bob gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant depreciation of the money's value for both of us, his proposed split is relatively even and takes into account the urgency of the situation. Further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, so I'll settle for this.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
