Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the sentiment of starting fair, but with inflation working against you, perhaps a slightly adjusted split would be more beneficial. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
