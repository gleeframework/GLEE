"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good chunk of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being too generous, let's take a bit more for myself this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
