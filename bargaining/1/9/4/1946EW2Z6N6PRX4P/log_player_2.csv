Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not happy with your last offer.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering inflation has affected our shares differently. 
# Bob gain: 400000
