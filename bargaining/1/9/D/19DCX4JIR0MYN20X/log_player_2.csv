"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split. I think this is more reasonable.""}\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each round, I'm trying to get a bit more in this round to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's be practical. This is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money's value is decreasing for me, I think I can still get a slightly better deal. Since Alice is trying to rush the decision, I'll try to hold out for a more favorable split. The fact that she's emphasizing the practicality of the deal makes me think there's room for negotiation. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand the value is decreasing, but I believe this split is more fair considering the circumstances.""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm trying to secure a larger share to offset the loss. However, I'm also trying to be realistic and offer Alice a significant amount, hoping she'll see the compromise and accept. The goal is to find a balance where both parties feel they're getting a reasonable deal despite the inflation affecting my side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is already a compromise. Let's end this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, and given that Alice's gain remains unaffected, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in our gains is minimal, and further rounds will only decrease the value of my potential gain, making this a reasonable point to conclude the negotiation."
