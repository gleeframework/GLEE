I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get the deal done quickly and avoid any inflation issues. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too unbalanced, and I'm not going to give up 90% of the money. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try and find a more balanced solution this time, but I still want to ensure I get a fair share. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
