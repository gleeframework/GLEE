"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This means I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept the offer if it's better than my previous offer. In this case, I gain $200,000, which is less than my previous offer of $600,000.

However, I'll accept the offer since it's a better option than going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.
