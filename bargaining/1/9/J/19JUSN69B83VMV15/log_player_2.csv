Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference from your last offer. I'm willing to be more reasonable, but I'm also confident I can get a better deal if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but her position is weakening faster than mine due to the higher inflation rate she faces.  While getting only $4000 isn't great, it's better to hold out and see if I can push for a more favorable split in the later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's find a compromise. This is slightly better for you than my last offer, and it saves us both from losing more to inflation.""}
