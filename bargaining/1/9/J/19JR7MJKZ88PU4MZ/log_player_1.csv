{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a simple and straightforward way to divide the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, as it's not a significant improvement from the 50/50 split I proposed initially. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll let Bob know that I'm not accepting this offer and wait for his next proposal."

I'm not happy with the 35/65 split, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor than before. I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

I'm really not happy with the 28/72 split, as it's getting increasingly unfair. The inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money, and I'm starting to get worried that we'll end up with nothing if we don't make a deal soon.
