"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This split gives us both a good chunk of the money, and we don't have to risk it disappearing with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll consider Bob's proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really biting now! The money is worth 20% less than it was in the second round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm not getting any younger. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise."
