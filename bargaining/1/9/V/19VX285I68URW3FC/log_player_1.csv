Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. But I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
