Round 2

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. But I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't account for the time pressure or the inflation working against me. 55/45 is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
