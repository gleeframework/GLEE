"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm happy to share the wealth, but I think we can do even better. How about we split it 55/45 in my favor?  It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from there.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try 50/50 this time.  It's a fair split, and it's better for both of us than the last round. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and given the inflation, it's better than risking a lower payout in the next round."
