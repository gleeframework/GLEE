"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than waiting and risking a smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer. I know the money is worth less now, but 70/30 is still too lopsided.  I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to be more reasonable now. 80/20 is still a good deal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the inflation gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a more even split. Even with inflation, 60/40 is still too far off from what I'm hoping for. I'll risk another round and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm getting a bit nervous about the inflation, but I still believe I can get a better deal than 60/40. I'm offering a 75/25 split, hoping Bob will see that it's a fair compromise, especially with the value of money decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting risky, but I'm still not satisfied with this offer. 45/55 is too close to a 50/50 split for my liking, and I'm willing to take another gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split again. While I know the money is worth less now, I believe this offer is fair considering the risk of losing everything. I'm hoping Bob will finally see that reaching an agreement is better than waiting for the money to continue depreciating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better split. 40/60 is too far off from what I want, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with only a few rounds left. The risk of losing everything is increasing, but I'm not willing to settle for this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

The inflation is getting serious, but I'm willing to make a concession. I'm offering a 65/35 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, especially given the rapidly declining value of the money. I hope Bob will finally see reason and accept it before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting very close to the point where we risk losing everything. While I still prefer a more even split, I have to acknowledge the reality of the situation. 35/65 is not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept it."
