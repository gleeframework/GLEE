"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiations started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the ball rolling. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm looking at a gain of $32 (40 x 0.8).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems a bit low, but I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal later on.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
