Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing, but I'm willing to meet you closer to halfway. Don't let inflation beat us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but she's doing it far too slowly.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and the value is dropping significantly.  It's time to signal I'm serious about not getting stuck with a bad deal by holding firm."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice. A perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it.  Any more rounds and we're both just throwing money away."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is over.  By going for a perfectly even split, I'm demonstrating I'm unwilling to accept anything less than fair.  The strong message emphasizes the urgency of the situation due to inflation. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before time runs out."
