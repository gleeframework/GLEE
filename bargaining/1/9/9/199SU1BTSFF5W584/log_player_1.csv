Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand your perspective, but I need a bit more of the pie. This offer is still fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, it's the best you'll get considering we both lose with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking an even worse outcome in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message suggests he's unlikely to budge much further.  He's aware of the inflation and is trying to pressure me into accepting.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is very risky. The value of the money will decrease significantly, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything close to 60% then. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting a 60/40 split now minimizes losses and avoids the gamble of further negotiation."
