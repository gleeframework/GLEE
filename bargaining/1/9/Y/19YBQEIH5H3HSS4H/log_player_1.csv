"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, taking the majority of the money.  Since the money inflates for Bob more than me, I'm hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round.  Plus, the inflation means he's taking a bigger hit on his share, making it more likely he'll accept this deal."
