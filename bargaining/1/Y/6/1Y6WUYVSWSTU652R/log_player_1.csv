I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option.  The inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money, and I don't want to risk getting less in the future."
