"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  We can then continue to negotiate in future rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob in this round, I'll take into account the reduced value of his share. I'll compare the value of his share in this round to the value of my share in the first round, which is still worth the same.

My share in the first round was 600,000, and Bob's share in this round is 600,000, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation. So, the effective value of Bob's share in this round is 95% of 600,000, which is 570,000.

Comparing this to my share of 400,000 in this round, I think I'm getting a worse deal than in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me than the previous one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share""
}
