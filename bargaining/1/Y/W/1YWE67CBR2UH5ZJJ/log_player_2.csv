"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems somewhat fair at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Alice is losing value faster than I am each round. It's worth seeing if I can secure a better deal in a later round, even if it means accepting slightly less than 50%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This offer recognizes your initial advantage, but also reflects the declining value over time. Let's make a deal now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Alice's Position:** By offering slightly more than I initially wanted (4800 vs. desired 5000), I acknowledge that Alice is in a stronger position due to the faster depreciation of her share. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're only in round 2, but it's crucial to remind Alice about the shrinking pie.  Delaying benefits no one.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I want to avoid a bidding war that could backfire. This offer strikes a balance between aiming for a decent share and encouraging a swift agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by using the word ""reasonable.""  While the offer has technically improved in my favor, it's not enough to offset the inflation.  I need to hold firm and aim for a better split, especially since the money is devaluating faster for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before the money loses too much value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** After two rounds of back-and-forth, a clear and firm offer is needed.
* **Highlighting Shared Loss:**  By now, Alice should realize that her initial advantage is shrinking rapidly. Emphasizing the ""we"" and ""both"" in the message underscores the mutual risk of continued delay. 
* **50/50 as Leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, starting at an even split creates a psychological anchor. It might prompt Alice to counter with an offer that's still favorable to me, rather than risking further losses with continued haggling."
