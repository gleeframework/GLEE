Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  It's a pretty lopsided offer, but I'm hoping he'll take it in the first round.  We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd like more, with inflation, 5000 is better than the 7200 I'd get if I reject and make a counter offer."
