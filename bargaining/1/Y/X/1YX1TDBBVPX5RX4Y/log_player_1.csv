"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your generous offer, but I think we can do better.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This gives me a little more, but it also leaves you with a fair share. Let's finish this now and avoid the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
