"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 evenly, it seems like a fair deal, and there's no incentive to reject it in hopes of getting a better offer in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees a gain of $50, which is half of the total amount. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next!"
