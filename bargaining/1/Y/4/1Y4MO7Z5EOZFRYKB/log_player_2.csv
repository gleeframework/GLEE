"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think that's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With a 5% decrease in value for me and a 10% decrease for Alice, I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's Alice's turn! I've taken into account the decrease in value for both of us, and I believe this offer is more balanced. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50.  We both lose money with each round, so let's end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think Alice's offer of 50/50 is a fair one, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. It's better to accept this offer now rather than risking further losses in future rounds. Let's end the game here!"
