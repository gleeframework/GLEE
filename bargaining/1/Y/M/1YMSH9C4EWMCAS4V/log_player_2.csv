Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'll keep an eye on that inflation..."

I'm taking a bit more for myself this round.  I'm assuming Alice is going to try to get as much as possible, and I want to make sure I get a decent share before the inflation hits too hard."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation is making the money I'd receive in future rounds worth significantly less. It's better to take what I can get now."
