Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to propose a division that reflects a more balanced split, taking into account the value of money for both of us. Since the money loses value for me over time, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground that accounts for the value of money for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!
