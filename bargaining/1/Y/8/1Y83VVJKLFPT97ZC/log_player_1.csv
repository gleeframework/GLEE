"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm willing to compromise early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'm taking the remaining $900,000, which is 90% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair starting point, let's see if we can improve from here 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 300,000
Bob gain: 630,000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
