"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, but I think I can get a better deal than 30% of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation that affects me. Since the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each round, I want to secure a larger portion to compensate for the loss. Offering Alice 55% still gives her a larger share, but I believe it's more reasonable considering my situation. I'm hoping she'll see the fairness in this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value decreases fast for you, Bob. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the value of money is decreasing rapidly for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of 35% is slightly better than her initial offer, but considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round. Perhaps Alice will be more willing to compromise as the game continues."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on me. I think 50/50 is a fair split at this point.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the rapidly decreasing value of money for me, I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in an equal split. While she doesn't face the same inflationary pressure, the risk of further rounds might encourage her to accept this offer. I'm trying to appeal to her sense of fairness and the uncertainty of future negotiations."
