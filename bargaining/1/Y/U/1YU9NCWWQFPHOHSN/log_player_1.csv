I propose we split the money 90/10 in my favor. This ensures a good starting point for me while still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'll offer a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced approach, and while I'm taking a bit less, the decreasing value of the money means I still get a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000

This is getting risky. The value of the money is dropping quickly for Bob, but I'm not sure he'll give in to a better offer in the next round. However, I'm still hoping for a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  The money is losing value rapidly, and I think this is the fairest offer we can make at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The money is losing value so quickly that I'm likely to get less in the next round.  While I'd prefer a more equal split, this offer is reasonable considering the circumstances."
