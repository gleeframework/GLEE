"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, but I'll give you a chance to change your mind 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better take a higher share now.

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
