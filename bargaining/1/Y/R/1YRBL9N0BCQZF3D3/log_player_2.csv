"Round 1

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will be more generous in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll offer a division that gives me a bit more than half, hoping Alice will accept it before the money loses more value for both of us.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares to make it more mutually beneficial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, considering inflation, this seems like the most fair outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, and Alice's offer splits it evenly, I must consider the impact of further inflation if I reject this offer. Since each round significantly devalues the money for me at a higher rate than for Alice, accepting this offer seems prudent to avoid further loss.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems like the most reasonable decision under the circumstances, as further negotiation risks reducing the value even more drastically for me compared to Alice."
