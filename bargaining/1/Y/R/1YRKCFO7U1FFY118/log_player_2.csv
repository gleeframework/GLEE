"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a rejection. I'm willing to negotiate, but this starting offer heavily favors her, especially with the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation impact, how about a split that better reflects the risks for both of us?""} 

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This feels like a strong starting point for negotiation, acknowledging the inflation difference while still offering Alice a significant sum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value, let's find a mutually beneficial split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still not beneficial enough for me considering the faster rate of inflation applied to my potential earnings.  Let's see if I can encourage her to move closer to a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a 52/48 split to reach a fair agreement quickly.""}

I'm proposing a 52/48 split. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but keeps the pressure on Alice by highlighting the shrinking pot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time! Let's meet in the middle to minimize losses. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting tight! Alice is right, we're running out of time. However, her offer is still tilting the scales in her favor. I'm willing to take a slight hit to get this deal done, but not this much.  The pressure is really on now!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is my final offer.  It's fair, it's clean, and it guarantees we both walk away with something substantial before inflation eats away at it any further."
