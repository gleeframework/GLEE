"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, which I'm hoping Bob will find reasonable. Now it's his turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my potential gain is 50% of the original amount, which is a significant reduction due to inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... 

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 50% of the original amount due to inflation, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a slight improvement from my initial offer, and I'm hoping Bob will find it more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting now!

Considering my potential gain is worth only 27.1% of the original amount, I'm in a tough spot. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

After weighing my options, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the deal and hope Bob is happy with it!"
