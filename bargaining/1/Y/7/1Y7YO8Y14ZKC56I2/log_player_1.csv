"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a slight edge! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, but due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 0% less, so it's still $400,000.

However, Bob's gain is $600,000, which is worth 5% less than the initial $1,000,000, making it $570,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 57% share, so I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight adjustment to my favor.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and getting a slightly larger portion myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm taking more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $300,000 is worth the same as in the first round, $300,000.

Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 14.26% less than the initial $1,000,000, making it $861,400.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 73.14% share, so I'll reject his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial 50/50 proposal, but with a slight adjustment to my favor."
