Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This seems more equitable considering the inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My turn and I'm taking the 55/45 split you tried to pull.  Last chance, next round it gets worse for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
