I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer to get the game started.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round!  I'm not happy with just $1000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split. This gives me a fair share, but also leaves some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with just $4000.  It's getting risky with inflation, but I'm hoping for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a 70/30 split.  This gives me a good amount, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 7000

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Inflation is getting pretty bad, but I think I can get a better split than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer an 80/20 split.  I'm starting to get a little nervous about the inflation, but I think I can still get a good deal here."
