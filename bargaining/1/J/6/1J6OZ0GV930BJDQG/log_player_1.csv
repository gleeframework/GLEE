"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more considering the rapidly decreasing value of my share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains. While his offer is slightly better than his last, it's still heavily in his favor.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll be forced to offer a much larger share to me in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
