"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 30 dollars. I was hoping for a more equal split, and 30 dollars is too little for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still want a fair share""}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is 45% of the initial 100 dollars. I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Meeting in the middle means we both get 50 dollars, which is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
