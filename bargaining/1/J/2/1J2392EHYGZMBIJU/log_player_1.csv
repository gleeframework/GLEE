I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming to get 90% of the money. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a significantly smaller share right away, or if he'll be more competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round, I'm not willing to settle for a 50/50 split just yet.  I believe I can still get a better deal, especially considering inflation is affecting Bob's gains."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more reasonable.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in accepting this deal before inflation eats away more of his potential gains."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to my ideal split, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm seeing that inflation is starting to affect Bob's gains significantly, and I'm going to try to leverage that in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly. I'm hoping that Bob will start to realize that the inflation is going to cost him more and more with each passing round, making my offer increasingly attractive."

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, aiming for a larger share.  I'm confident that with the effects of inflation, Bob will be more inclined to accept my offer than to risk losing even more of his potential share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

Round 10

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Inflation has been significantly impacting his potential gains, and we're getting close to the end of the game.  While I'd prefer a larger share, taking a 75/25 split feels like the best way to secure a good amount of money before the risk of getting nothing becomes too high."
