Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think it's time for a more balanced approach.  Let's split it 950k for me and 50k for you. It's a fairer compromise than your last offer, and it helps us both avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough spot, but I'm going to gamble Alice is getting desperate.  She's trying to frame her offer as generous, but it's barely different from my rejected offer (just flipped)."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 902500,
""alice_gain"": 97500,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking!  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and each round significantly eats into my potential gains due to inflation. I need to apply pressure.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering slightly more than Alice's previous offer, but it's still heavily in my favor.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Alice will feel pressured to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal (or nothing) in a later round. 

It's a risky move, but the time pressure makes a bold strategy necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think you're being unreasonable. This is my final offer.  If you don't take it, you'll be left with practically nothing. It's time to end this game. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has me backed into a corner.  While accepting this offer is essentially giving up on almost all the money, rejecting it means I risk getting absolutely nothing in the final round.  The inflation penalty is too severe to gamble at this point.  It's infuriating, but I have to take what I can get."
