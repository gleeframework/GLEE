"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This leaves a good portion for Bob, but ensures I get the majority.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a lot of money, I know I can get more. With each round, the money is worth less for Bob, meaning I have more leverage. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 700,000 to 300,000 split. This is still a good deal for Bob, considering the inflation. He's losing value on his gains faster than I am, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable outcome if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and while I'd prefer more, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. This offer ensures I still get a decent amount and avoids the potential of losing even more in subsequent rounds."
