{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  Since I'm the one who stands to lose the most from inflation, I'm going to try to get as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"

I'm still trying to get the majority of the money, but I'm being a little more reasonable this time.  I'm offering Bob a small increase in his share, hoping he'll see that it's better to accept now than to risk further inflation."

I'm making a final, major concession.  The inflation has severely diminished Bob's share, and I'm giving him almost a third of the money to reach a deal. This should be a fair offer, and I hope Bob finally recognizes the urgency of the situation."

```

This is my final offer.  I'm giving Bob a very large share of the money, but I'm also running out of time.  If he rejects this offer, both of us will end up with nothing.  I hope he'll see reason and accept this deal before it's too late."

This is my last attempt to reach a compromise. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'm running out of time. If Bob rejects this, we will both lose everything.  I hope he realizes that this is the only way for us to get anything at all."
