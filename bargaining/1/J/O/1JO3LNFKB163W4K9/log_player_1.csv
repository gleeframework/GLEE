"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take $900,000 and give $100,000 to Bob. This gives me the largest possible share while still potentially being acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While my share is much lower than the previous round, the inflation makes it much less valuable, and it's likely that rejecting will result in an even lower offer in the next round.  It's better to secure $500,000 now."
