"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40, and I'll take $60.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with the first offer, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's aggressive offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you 50, and we can call it a day.""
}
```

This offer is more balanced, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I want more now 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is even more aggressive. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 85% of the remaining money, even with the reduced value due to inflation. I'll wait for a more reasonable offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's previous offer was 85% for him, I'll try to take a slightly larger share, but not as high as 85%. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to take a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than before, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
