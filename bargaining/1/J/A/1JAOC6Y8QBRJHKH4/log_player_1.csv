"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to consider the adjusted amounts. 

My gain of 4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 3800. Bob's gain of 6000 remains the same.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal. 

I'll accept this offer.
