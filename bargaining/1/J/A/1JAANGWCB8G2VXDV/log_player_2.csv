Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your offer, and I appreciate your attempt at compromise. However, I believe we can do better. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fairer distribution considering the inflation factor, and it gives us both a substantial amount. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While she acknowledges the inflation, her proposed 60/40 split doesn't reflect the much faster rate at which Bob's money is losing value.  It's better to negotiate further and aim for a more equitable split, even if it means reaching the later rounds."

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your urgency, but I'm still not convinced this is a fair deal. I'm offering a 55/45 split, a compromise that takes into account both our losses due to inflation. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that benefits us both before we lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical decision at this stage:

* **Time Pressure:** With 7 rounds remaining, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the worse the offers will likely become for Bob, due to the disparity in inflation rates.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to a 50/50 split, showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's unlikely she'll agree to a significantly better deal for Bob given the remaining time. 

This offer ensures Bob gets something substantial before inflation eats away too much of the potential gain."
