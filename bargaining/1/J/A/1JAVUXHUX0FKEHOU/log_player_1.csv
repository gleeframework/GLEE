"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'll be making the first offer and the money is worth more to me now than it will be later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 720,000 for me, and 280,000 for Bob. This still gives me a majority, but it accounts for the inflation and shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is better than nothing, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round to see if Bob will budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 576,000 for me and 424,000 for Bob. While inflation is hurting me significantly, I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this is a better deal than the last round and accept."
