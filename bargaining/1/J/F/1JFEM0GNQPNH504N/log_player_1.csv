"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and I know Bob's offer from round 2, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
