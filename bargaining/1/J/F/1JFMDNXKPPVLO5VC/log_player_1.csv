"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's end the game 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to consider the relative values of the amounts. However, I still think I should aim for a fair split. Bob's offer is quite skewed in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round), I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is closer to Bob's previous offer, but still tries to balance the relative values of the money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the current values, I think I should try to push for a better deal. Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best possible outcome.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less for me now (48.8% less than the first round). I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the current values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take what's left 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! With the money worth 67.23% less than the first round, I'm getting desperate. However, I don't want to leave with nothing. Bob's offer is not great, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
