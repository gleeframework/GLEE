"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much worse offer than my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share, but still offering Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still less than my initial proposal, the impact of inflation is starting to hurt.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
