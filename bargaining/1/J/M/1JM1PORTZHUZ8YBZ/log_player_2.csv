I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal! Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We can both benefit more from the inflation if we get to the next round!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You tried to be clever, but I won't fall for it. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although it's less than the first offer, I'm taking a hit on the value. It's better to take what I can now before it's worth even less!"
