Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making my decision. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be strategic.

For Round 2, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the offer is equal, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can end the game."
