Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious about the deadline, but I'm still not convinced by your offer. 57-43 is my new proposal. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

It's getting tight, but Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that the diminishing value of the money affects me more than her. I need to hold my ground a little longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you practically half now. A 51/49 split is more than fair. Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated by your 'take it or leave it' tone. I'll keep negotiating. 56-44 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to accept a deal where I get less than 50%, especially after inflation. However, Alice seems determined to push this to the brink, and the longer this drags on, the worse it gets for me. Taking 44 now is better than risking getting even less later, or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
