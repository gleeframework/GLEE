"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain: 450,000 * 0.81 (since 1 - 0.19 = 0.81) = 364,500
* Alice's gain: 550,000 * 0.909 (since 1 - 0.091 = 0.909) = 499,050

It seems like I'll be getting less than 50% of the total, which is a bit disappointing. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the effective values are:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.65 (since 1 - 0.3459 = 0.6541) = 260,400
* Alice's gain: 600,000 * 0.8155 (since 1 - 0.1845 = 0.8155) = 489,300

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'll play it safe and accept.
