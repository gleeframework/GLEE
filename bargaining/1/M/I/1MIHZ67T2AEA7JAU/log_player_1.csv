Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob's offer is still generous, but the inflation means my share is significantly reduced. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation has really hit my share hard, and Bob's offer is not ideal. However, if I reject, the next round will see my share shrink even further.  I'll take the 450,000 and hope to recover some lost ground in future negotiations."
