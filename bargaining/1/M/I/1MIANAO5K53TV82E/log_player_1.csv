"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, getting 60% of the money is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
