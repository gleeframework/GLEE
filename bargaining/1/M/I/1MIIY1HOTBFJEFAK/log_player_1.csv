Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to play hardball.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split given the inflation factor. It's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
