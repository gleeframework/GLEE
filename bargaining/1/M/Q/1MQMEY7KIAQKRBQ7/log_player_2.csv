"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair to me! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I know Alice's offer is going to depreciate faster than mine.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I'll take 7000, and you get 3000.  This way, we both get a fair share, even with the inflation!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll take 6000, you get 4000. This is the best I can do considering the inflation.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a good compromise given the inflation. I'll take the 4000 and end this game."
