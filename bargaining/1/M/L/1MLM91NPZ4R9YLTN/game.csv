42.0,58.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your share, I believe this split is more reasonable. Each round, the value you receive diminishes more significantly than mine. Let's settle on this before it gets worse for both of us.",Bob,4,

40.0,60.0,"Considering the substantial loss of value on your end due to inflation, I think this offer is generous. The longer we wait, the less you'll receive in real terms. It's in both our interests to conclude this now, but I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable.",Bob,6,
