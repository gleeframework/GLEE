"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, considering I'm losing less value to inflation each round. Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe this is a more reasonable split. I'm willing to take a larger share since my money holds its value better over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but your previous offer was too low for me. This offer is a compromise - let's get this done before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I still think I can get a better offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share. I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to compromise further. The current split doesn't account enough for the value I'm preserving over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your share, I believe this split is more reasonable. Each round, the value you receive diminishes more significantly than mine. Let's settle on this before it gets worse for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair deal here. While I understand your perspective on the inflation, my losses are significant. This offer is a compromise, and I urge you to accept it before the money dwindles further. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
I still believe I have the upper hand due to the inflation rates. Alice's losses are indeed significant, but that also means she has more incentive to settle sooner rather than later. I'll hold out for a better offer, as the diminishing value of the money impacts her more severely."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial loss of value on your end due to inflation, I think this offer is generous. The longer we wait, the less you'll receive in real terms. It's in both our interests to conclude this now, but I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable.""}"
