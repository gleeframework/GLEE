"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10%, I'll take 90%. We have plenty of time to negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! While there's time to negotiate, I'm not accepting such a low starting point. Alice clearly undervalues the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but inflation is real.  Let's make this happen now."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40.  We both get a decent amount and avoid more losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but this offer is still unacceptable. We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and the value is dropping fast.  I need to push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's fair given the dwindling value.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
