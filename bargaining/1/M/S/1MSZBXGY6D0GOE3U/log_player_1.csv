"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is trying to flip the script and take the larger share.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up the larger share so easily. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly smaller share than I did in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it even, a 55-45 split in my favor seems like a good compromise, given the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still pushing for a 55-45 split in his favor.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than I did in the previous round, but still trying to get a better deal to account for the decreasing value of the money."
