Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but I still believe my initial reasoning for a 60/40 split is valid. Since we are losing money to inflation with each round, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.

# Alice gain: 55
