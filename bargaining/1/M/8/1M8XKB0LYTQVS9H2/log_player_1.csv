# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money I gain being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll have to be extremely careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get. I'd like to get a slightly better share, but I'm not sure if Bob will improve his offer. However, I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, making it even harder to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
