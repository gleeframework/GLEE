"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Fair share for both""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. I believe this is a reasonable and fair division, considering we are starting the negotiations. I'm eager to see Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time. This offer still leaves you with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better outcome in the next rounds, despite the impact of inflation on the value of the money.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Still aiming for a fair share considering inflation""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer to reflect the decreased value of money due to inflation but still aim to secure a larger share, hoping Bob will find this acceptable."
