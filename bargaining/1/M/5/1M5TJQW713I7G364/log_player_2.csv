"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round""}\n\nSince Alice is losing 10% of the value each round, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering a slightly uneven split in my favor. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer rather than risking further losses in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a better deal than last round.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is still trying to get the larger share, despite the fact that the money is worth less to her with each passing round. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait and see if Alice will make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You're losing a lot of value, I think I deserve more""}\n\nSince Alice is losing 10% of the value each round, the money is now worth 19% less to her than in the first round, and will be worth 27.1% less in the next round. Given this, I'm making a more aggressive offer, taking advantage of Alice's decreasing valuation of the money. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer rather than risking further losses in the next round."
