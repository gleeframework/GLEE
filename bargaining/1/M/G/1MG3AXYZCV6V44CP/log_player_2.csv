"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want a better deal.  While the offer is somewhat fair in this round, I'm hoping to get more later with the inflation affecting Alice more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's adjust the split to account for the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offering a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, inflation is hitting me hard now. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Alice is taking a hit from the inflation too, making this a decent compromise."
