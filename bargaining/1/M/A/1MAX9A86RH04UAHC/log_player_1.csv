I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see what he thinks!"

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a lot more than Bob offered me in the first round, I'm still not happy with the split. I think I can do better."

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly more even split this time, but still keeping a larger share for myself. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if we go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of me! I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a better deal."

This is a 50/50 split, and while I'd prefer more, it's the fairest offer so far.  We're running out of rounds, so it's time to take what I can get!"
