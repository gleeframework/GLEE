"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%.  It's a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be fair. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, considering I'm taking on the risk in round 2.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take a bit less than my initial offer, 55% for me and 45% for you.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still advantageous for Bob to hold out a bit longer. The inflation factor means time is on Bob's side to push for a better deal.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the diminishing returns."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you negotiating. How about we split the difference from our previous offers?  It's a fair deal considering the time pressure.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to take a smaller share than my last offer, 51% to your 49%.  Let's be realistic about the time pressure and take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now very close to an even split. With the increasing inflation rate, the difference between 49% and a potential 50% in future rounds is heavily outweighed by the risk of losing everything. Accepting minimizes potential losses and guarantees a significant sum."
