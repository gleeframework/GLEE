"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the total amount and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more generous than your first offer, but I'm not there yet 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, so I'm offering a 60:40 split, hoping Bob will find it more appealing."
