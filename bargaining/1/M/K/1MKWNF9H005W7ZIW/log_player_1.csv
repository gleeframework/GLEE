Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer! I'm not thrilled about giving up 800,000$. Here's my response:

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the whole $1,000,000. It's better than continuing to negotiate with someone who's not willing to compromise."
