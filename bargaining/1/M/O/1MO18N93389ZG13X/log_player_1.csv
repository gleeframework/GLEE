Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting anything at all and accept it in the first round.  We'll see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, and considering the inflation, it's likely he won't get a better deal in the future.  It's time to take the guaranteed 50% and avoid risking getting nothing."
