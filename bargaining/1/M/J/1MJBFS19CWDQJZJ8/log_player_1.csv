"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly!""}\n\nI've made the first offer, giving myself $55 and Bob $45, with a message encouraging Bob to accept and end the game quickly to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable.  It's still close to even, and we can avoid the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer, as I initially proposed a 55/45 split in my favor and Bob is now offering the same split but in their favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal, considering the inflation will continue to reduce the value of the money.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle to minimize losses.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, giving myself $52 and Bob $48. My message to Bob emphasizes the importance of finding a middle ground to minimize the losses due to inflation, which is now in its third round and continuing to devalue the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in compromising and accept this offer."
