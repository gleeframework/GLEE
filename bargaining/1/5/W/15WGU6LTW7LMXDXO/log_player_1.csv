"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%. You can accept or propose a better deal.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. If he accepts, the game will end, and we'll both get our respective shares. If he rejects, I'll have to come up with a new proposal for Round 2."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 6000 is actually equivalent to 4800 in the first round. I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
