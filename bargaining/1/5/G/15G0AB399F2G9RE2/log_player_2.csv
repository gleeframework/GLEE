Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  The value decreases rapidly with each round.  My offer is more than fair considering we're both losing out the longer this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
