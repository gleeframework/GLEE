"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a significant share, but I'm leaving a decent amount for Bob to incentivize acceptance. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, the value of the money is decreasing with each round, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
``` 

I'm going to lower my share again to 700,000.  This is still a significant share, and hopefully, Bob sees the value in accepting this offer rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round.  I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of losing a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the value of the money is declining rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's better to secure 300,000 now than to keep pushing and potentially end up with nothing.  I've learned a valuable lesson about inflation and the importance of compromise in negotiation."
