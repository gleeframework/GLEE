"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. This way, I'm showing that I'm confident in my negotiating skills, but I'm also leaving room for Bob to counteroffer."
