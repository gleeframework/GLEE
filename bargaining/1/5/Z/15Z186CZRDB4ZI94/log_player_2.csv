"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, but for Alice, the value remains the same. I need to make an offer to divide the $100, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value for me in this round
Since the money is worth 19% less for me, the effective value of the $100 for me in this round is 81% of $100, which is $81.

### Step 3: Decide on a reasonable offer
Given that Alice's last offer was 35 for me and 65 for her, and considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I need to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the urgency of the situation. Aiming for a slightly higher gain than Alice's last offer to me, but still being mindful of the need for compromise.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer
I will offer a division where I get slightly more than Alice's last offer to me but less than my previous offer to her, considering the inflation. Let's propose 52 for me and 48 for Alice, with a message emphasizing the need for compromise and the urgency of the situation.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise at 52 for me and 48 for you. Time is indeed running out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer stands. Let's be reasonable and close this deal before the inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer from Alice
Alice's offer is 40 for me and 60 for her, with the message that her offer stands and we should close the deal before inflation further reduces my potential gains.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on my gains
The money I gain is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round. This means that the $40 offered by Alice is effectively worth less due to inflation.

### Step 3: Calculate the effective value of Alice's offer
To find the effective value of Alice's offer for me, I need to subtract 34.39% from the $40. This will give me an understanding of the offer's value in the context of the decreasing worth of the money for me.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer
Given the effective value of Alice's offer and considering the decreasing value of the money with each round, I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting the offer now versus continuing negotiations. The key factor is whether I believe I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation.

### Step 5: Make a decision
Considering the information above, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and continue with the game.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
