"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 60% of $80 (20% less than the original $100), which is $48. And Bob will get 40% of $80, which is $32.

Here's my decision:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting this offer yet, I want to try to get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This way, I get 55% of the current $80 (20% less than the original $100), and Bob gets 45%."
