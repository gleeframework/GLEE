"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game with a twist of inflation. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my share, but I also need to consider that Bob might reject my offer, especially in early rounds when inflation is less of a factor.  Offering 90/10 seems like a good balance - a decent starting point for Alice while still leaving some room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, it's important to consider the inflation factor. My share is worth 20% less, but Bob's is only 10% less. If I accept, I get a measly 10% of the original value, while Bob gets a huge 90% - a terrible outcome. However, rejecting means the game continues, and with each round, my share becomes even less valuable due to inflation. 

Considering the potential for further losses from inflation, and the fact that Bob seems willing to play hardball, I'm going to risk rejecting the offer. Hopefully, in the next round, I can secure a better deal, even if it means a smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure a decent share before it eats away at my potential gains. This offer still gives Bob a considerable portion, but it reflects the shrinking value of my earnings.  It's a risky move, but I believe offering a more equitable split will incentivize Bob to accept, as he will also be losing out on value with each passing round."
