"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and go for a more uneven split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to take the risk. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2. Since the money is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value, my gain will be worth 0.9025 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Your turn to decide!""
}

# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and go for a more aggressive split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! My gain of $1000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $9000 is worth 73.9% of its original value.

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can do better in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
