"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split it 60/40, but I'll need to keep the bigger share since the money is losing value each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this deal is the safest option."
