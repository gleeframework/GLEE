"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 10% of the money, especially since there are more rounds to go and the money is losing value. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Alice 40% of the money, which is still a good deal considering the inflation.  I'm hoping she'll take it, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 19 
# Alice gain: 81 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. While the inflation has made the money worth less, I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping Alice will see the value of getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all due to further inflation. I believe this is a fair offer that balances our potential losses from the declining value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 27 
# Alice gain: 73 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although the inflation is making the money worth less, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Alice is still trying to take a large share of the money, and I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going all-in with this offer.  The inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure a decent portion of the money before it becomes worthless.  Alice is likely feeling the pressure too, so hopefully, she'll accept this deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 34 
# Alice gain: 66 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The inflation is getting out of control, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Alice is still trying to get the majority of the money, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not going to settle for a third of the shrinking pie."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer again. With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on both of us.  I'm offering Alice a small share, but it's better than nothing, and it's the best deal she's likely to get."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is biting hard, I'm still going to reject this offer.  Alice is still trying to get the majority of the money, and I'm not going to let her get away with it.  There are only a few rounds left, and I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}
```

This is my final offer.  The inflation is devastating the value of the money, and we are running out of time. I'm offering Alice a very small share, but it's better than nothing.  If she rejects this, we both lose everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get more than half of the money, and I am not going to give in. I'm prepared to walk away with nothing if I have to. We are both losing money rapidly with each passing round, and this offer is not worth risking everything to get it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 100, ""alice_gain"": 0}
```

This is it. We're both on the brink of getting nothing. I'm taking all the money, as it's better than getting nothing due to inflation.  It's a risky move, but it's our only chance."
