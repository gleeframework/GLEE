"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a decent start 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 600,000$ in the first round, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted again. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my side, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, so I need to adjust my expectations again.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 700,000$ in the fourth round. I'll try to hold out for a better offer, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is losing value rapidly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
