"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me getting the majority. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems tempting in the first round, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Accepting this offer means losing a significant amount of money in future rounds due to the devaluation. It's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
