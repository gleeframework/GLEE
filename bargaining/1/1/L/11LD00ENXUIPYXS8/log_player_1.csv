Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000/100,000 split, keeping the majority for myself.  It's a good starting point, and since I'm the first proposer, it's unlikely Bob will reject it outright.  I'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  I'm not sure I can do better than this. The inflation will only make the money less valuable for me if we go to another round. It's time to take the 500,000."
