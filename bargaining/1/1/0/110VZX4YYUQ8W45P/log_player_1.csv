"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll gain as $5,500 (5000 / 0.9) and Bob will gain $5,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that has occurred so far (20% total). Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

This way, I'll get $4,500 and Bob will get $5,500."
