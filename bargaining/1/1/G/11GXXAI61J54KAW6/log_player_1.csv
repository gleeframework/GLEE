"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 60 dollars in the first round is now equivalent to 48 dollars in the second round. 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. He's proposing a 20-80 split, which is quite lopsided. I'm not sure if I want to accept such a low share. I'll reject the offer.

```
