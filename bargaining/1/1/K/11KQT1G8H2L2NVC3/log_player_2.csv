"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. Let's try again 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Although inflation has affected the value of the money, it's still a decent deal for me. I'm not sure how much longer the negotiation will go on, and I don't want to risk the value of my share dropping further."
