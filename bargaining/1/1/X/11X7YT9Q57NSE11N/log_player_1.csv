"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor, as your money depreciates at a faster rate than mine. This allows us both to maximize our gains in this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
