"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very straightforward offer. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm going to assume he's just as eager to get something as I am."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting 50% now is better than risking getting nothing later on."
