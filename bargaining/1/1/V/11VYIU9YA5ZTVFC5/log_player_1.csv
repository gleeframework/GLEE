"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000, and Bob gets 40%. This way, I'll get a larger share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me than my original proposal. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
