"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather have a smaller share of the lower value than a larger share of the higher value. I'll accept Bob's offer.
