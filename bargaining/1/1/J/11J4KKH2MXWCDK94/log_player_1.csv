"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much control 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
