"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give $400,000 to Bob. Given the inflation rate, where the money loses 10% of its value for Bob with each passing round, this initial offer seems reasonable and gives Bob a substantial amount before any depreciation occurs. It's a starting point that acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's share over potential future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round but 10% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Bob's offer to split it evenly does not take into account the depreciation of the money's value on his end. I'll reject this offer in hopes of securing a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share remains stable, but yours is decreasing in value. This offer is more generous than it seems.""}\n\nGiven the ongoing inflation affecting Bob's share, my new offer reflects the changing value of the money. By proposing $650,000 for myself and $350,000 for Bob, I'm taking into account that the money's value for Bob has decreased by 10% in each round. This adjustment aims to balance the negotiation, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation.  This offer is still fair, given the current circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's willingness to compromise, the offer doesn't fully account for the significant depreciation of the money's value on his end. With the money being worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round and no change in value for me, I believe there's room for further negotiation to secure a more favorable deal. I'll reject this offer, anticipating a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is significantly impacting your share. I'm willing to end the game with this offer, considering the current value depreciation.""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share, now worth 27.1% less than initially, my new offer of $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob aims to bring the negotiation to a close. The disparity in the money's value between us has grown, and I believe this offer reflects a realistic adjustment to the circumstances, providing a clear incentive for Bob to accept and conclude the game."
