"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather get a smaller amount now and avoid further inflation. I accept Bob's offer.
