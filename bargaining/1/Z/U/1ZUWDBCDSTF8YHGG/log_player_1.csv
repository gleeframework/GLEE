Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. Inflation is eating our money! Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob. It's in our best interest to settle sooner.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome for me. There's a chance Bob might offer even less in future rounds, and the impact of inflation will make those offers worse than the current one. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount. Rejecting leads to uncertainty and the risk of getting a worse deal later."
