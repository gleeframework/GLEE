Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. It's not the best deal I've seen, but it's better than going to the next round and risking further erosion of the money's value."
