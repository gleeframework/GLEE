Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're aiming for a more equitable split, but I still think I can do a bit better. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging, and time is working against me due to inflation. While 420,000 is a significant sum, it's worth considerably less than it was in Round 1. I need to push for a more substantial gain before inflation eats away at the value."

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation is affecting your share more, I think 57-43 is a more realistic compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to use inflation as a bargaining chip, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. Accepting 430,000 now might seem tempting, but it's a substantial loss compared to the potential 50/50 split. I need to show firmness and make it clear that I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."
