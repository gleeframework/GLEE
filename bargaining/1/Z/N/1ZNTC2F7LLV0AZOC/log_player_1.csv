"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me almost all the money, but it also ensures that Bob has a small incentive to accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Let's see if he's feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this offer is significantly better than risking getting nothing in the next round. It's a good deal considering the circumstances."
