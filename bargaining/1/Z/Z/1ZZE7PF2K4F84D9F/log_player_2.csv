Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to do better. Given the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts I would receive if I accept this offer:

My gain: 4000 * 0.64 (since my gain is worth 36% less than in the first round) = 2560
Alice's gain: 6000 * 0.81 (since her gain is worth 19% less than in the first round) = 4860

This is a decent offer, but I can do better. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my offer:
