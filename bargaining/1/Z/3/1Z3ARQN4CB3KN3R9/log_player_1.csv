"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm aiming for a large share, but leaving a small portion for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting, especially considering the inflation on my side. I'll reject this and try for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. This is a more reasonable split considering the inflation we're both experiencing."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still offering a very lopsided deal in his favor, and while my share is slightly better, it's still too low given the inflation I've experienced.  I'll reject this and try for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still offering a considerable portion to Bob.  I'm hoping this offer is reasonable enough to incentivize him to accept, considering the inflation we've both faced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a significantly larger share than me, and the inflation on my side is crippling. However,  I'm holding out for a better deal. It's risky, but I still believe we can find a more fair compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

With each round, the pressure mounts. I'm reducing my share further, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion. I believe this is a fair offer given the substantial inflation we've both experienced. This might be my last chance for a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has taken a huge toll on my side, the value of my share is significantly lower than Bob's. This is the best deal I can get given the current situation. I'm hoping to avoid losing everything."
