"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing a friendly message to Bob. Now it's his turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $3200.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think I deserve more considering the inflation. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's aim for a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4500, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4500 I would gain is now worth 64% of the original amount ($3200 in round 2) multiplied by 80% (the inflation factor from round 2 to round 4), which is approximately $20,480 / 1.2 = 17,066.67. But considering the inflation factor from round 1 to round 4, the $4500 is worth 64% of 80% of the original amount, which is 0.64 * 0.8 * 4000 = 2048.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think I deserve more considering the inflation. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4080,
