"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the bigger share this round""
}
```

This way, I'll get $60 and Bob will get $40. I'm making the first offer, so it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it."
