Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable. Time is running out, and the value for you keeps dropping!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. We both lose if this goes on. 50/50 is the only fair split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's perception of the money's value is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting any longer significantly reduces his potential gain, making him less likely to offer a reasonable deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer carries the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable gain."
