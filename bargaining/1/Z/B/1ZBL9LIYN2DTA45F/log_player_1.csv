"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining money in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to get a larger share in the next round when the money is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than 60:40 in my favor. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Since I rejected the 60:40 split, I'll try to get an even better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it evenly this time. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll consider that when making my decision.

I'll accept this offer because it's an even split, and I don't think I can do better than that at this point. I'll take the 5000$.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
