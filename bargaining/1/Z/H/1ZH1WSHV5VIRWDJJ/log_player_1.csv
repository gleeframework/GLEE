I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share again.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, so I need to find a balance between securing a good share and avoiding losing everything."

``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal this bad.  I've already offered a significant share to Bob, and it's becoming increasingly clear that he's just trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm going to increase Bob's share one last time, hoping to find a compromise before the value of the money decreases too much further. We're getting close to the end of the game, so I need to reach a deal soon."
