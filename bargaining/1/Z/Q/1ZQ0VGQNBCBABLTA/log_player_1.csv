"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a compromise, suggesting that we can split it evenly, but I'm taking a slight majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's start with a more balanced proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is much of an improvement from my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slight edge""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's rejected proposal, while still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle and call it a day. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a fair one, and splitting the money down the middle is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game, as it's a 50/50 split and we've had a chance to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution."
