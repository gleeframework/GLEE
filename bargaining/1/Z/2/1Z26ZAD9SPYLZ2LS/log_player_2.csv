# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept this before inflation gets worse for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. While the deal is getting progressively worse, I'm banking on her accepting a more reasonable offer as we get closer to the deadline and she faces the risk of getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at the value. This offer ensures we both walk away with something.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my share to show I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a better outcome than Alice's previous offers. The message highlights the urgency and aims to make Alice more receptive to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting your share, don't wait any longer 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice continues to exploit the inflation factor, and her offer is barely budging.  I'm betting she's getting nervous as we approach the halfway point and the possibility of both of us losing becomes more real. I'll hold out for a better offer for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""We're running out of time.  Accept this offer, and we both benefit. Otherwise, we both risk ending up with nothing.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm keeping my offer slightly more appealing than Alice's, but I'm making it clear that time is running out.  The message emphasizes the potential loss for both of us if we don't reach an agreement soon. By round 8, the pressure of the deadline should be starting to influence Alice's decisions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot to inflation, this is your best chance 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The game has shifted.  The inflation is now seriously cutting into any potential gain for me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Alice knows the pressure is on, and it's unlikely she'll offer anything better than this at this stage."
