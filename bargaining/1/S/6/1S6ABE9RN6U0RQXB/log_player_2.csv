Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for us to end this quickly.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is more reflective of the situation.  Time is money, after all.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. I'm willing to accept this to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
