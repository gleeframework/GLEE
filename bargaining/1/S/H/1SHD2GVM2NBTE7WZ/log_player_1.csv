"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to accept a relatively fair deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastically unequal split, especially considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, acknowledging the inflation effects.  This should be more appealing than Bob's last offer and gives us both a decent share."
