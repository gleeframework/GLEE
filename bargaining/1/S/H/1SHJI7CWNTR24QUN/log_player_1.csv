"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is fairer, considering the inflation.  We both gain more in the long run if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
