Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant share, but still leaves Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll accept this, but I'm ready to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still not fair. I'll take my chances in the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This time, I'm offering a split closer to 60/40.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and making sure Bob has enough incentive to accept."
