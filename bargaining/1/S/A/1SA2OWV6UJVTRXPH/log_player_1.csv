"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and take 60%. It's a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think splitting it 50/50 is a fair compromise, and I'd rather take the $500,000 now than risk waiting for a better offer and risking further inflation."
