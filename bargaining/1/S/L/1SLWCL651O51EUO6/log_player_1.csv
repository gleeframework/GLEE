# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is on my side.  The longer this goes on, the less his potential gains are worth to him due to inflation.  I need to keep applying pressure."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a very generous offer considering the time constraint and the impact of inflation on my share. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation now, and his offer is creeping closer to a more agreeable split. However, I'm still in a strong position.  Two more rounds and the devaluation of his potential share will be significant.  I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it - a perfectly even split. There's no room for further negotiation, let's end this now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could continue to push my advantage, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures a significant payout.  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of Bob becoming increasingly desperate and offering even less is too great. It's time to accept a good offer and end the game."
