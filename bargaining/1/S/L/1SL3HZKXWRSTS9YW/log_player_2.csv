"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal is tempting, Bob can likely do better. He should see if he can negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get this done. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer is not on the table anymore, but I'm willing to make a small concession to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation is biting, Bob's gains are still worth significantly less than they would have been in the first round. Accepting this offer, though not ideal, is the best way to ensure he gets something."
