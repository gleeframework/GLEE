"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $50 in Round 2 is worth $47.50 (5% less than $50).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the initial offer I made was $60. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up control entirely! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $40 in Round 4 is worth $34.41 (14.26% less than $40).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I was hoping to get a bit more, and the ratio of 40:60 seems too skewed towards Bob. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, Bob. Meet me somewhere in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $58 and Bob receives $42. I'm framing it as a ""meeting in the middle"" to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. I think I deserve a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $45 in Round 6 is worth $34.92 (22.62% less than $45).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, although I was hoping to get a bit more, the offer of $45 is worth $34.92, which is a relatively decent amount considering the inflation. I'll take it and end the game."
