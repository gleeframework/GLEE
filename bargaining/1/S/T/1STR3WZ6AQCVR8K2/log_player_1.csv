Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious offer. It reflects the time pressure and the fact that we both need to agree soon. You're getting a decent chunk, and this protects me somewhat from the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's a significant increase from my previous proposal, and it takes into account the ongoing inflation.  Let's agree and split the money before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I accept."" 
}
``` 

It's getting too risky! While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is unlikely to offer more. Accepting this ensures I get a decent amount, even with the inflation considered.  Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing."
