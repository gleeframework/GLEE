{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm proposing a 99/1 split in favor of myself. This is a pretty aggressive opening, but given the time pressure and inflation, I believe it's in my best interest to try and secure a large share of the money early on."

```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the significant value I bring to the table.  I believe this offer is fair and should be attractive to Bob, considering the inflation penalty that's starting to take effect."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. The inflation penalty is becoming increasingly significant, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a low share. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."

```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable deal considering the increasing inflation penalty.  I hope Bob recognizes that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the value of the money decreases even further."

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm offering a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's a significant concession considering the inflation penalty we are both facing.  I believe this is a fair and realistic offer that reflects the value I bring to the table.  Let's hope Bob accepts it before the money becomes worth even less."

This offer is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  The inflation penalty is severely impacting the value of the money I would receive, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll continue negotiating for a more equitable split."

This offer is incredibly insulting. While the inflation penalty is significant, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share of the money. I'll continue negotiating for a more equitable split, even though time is running out."

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor. This is a significant concession given the inflation penalty, but it's the best I can do considering the time pressure and Bob's unwillingness to compromise.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation penalty is devastating at this point, I simply can't accept this offer. It's far too small, and I would be walking away with a negligible amount of money.  It's unfortunate that we couldn't reach an agreement, but I'd rather receive nothing than be forced to accept such an unfair deal."
