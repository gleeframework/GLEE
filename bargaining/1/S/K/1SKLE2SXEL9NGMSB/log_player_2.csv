It's worth taking a chance to see if I can get a better deal, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a better deal, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me some money, even if it's less than I hoped for."
