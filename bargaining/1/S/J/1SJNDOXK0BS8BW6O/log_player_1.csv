"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly more aggressive split, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I think I can do better than 3000$. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much, let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob (10% less from round 1 and another 10% from round 2), I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much of the advantage I had in the previous rounds. However, considering the significant inflation affecting Bob's share, I think I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 50-50 it is!""
}
```"
