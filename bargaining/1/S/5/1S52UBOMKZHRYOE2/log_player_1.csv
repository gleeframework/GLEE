I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small share.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer.  The money has lost value, but I can still do better than a 10% cut!  Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This is still a good deal for me, even with the inflation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
