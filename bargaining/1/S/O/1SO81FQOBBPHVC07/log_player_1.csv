"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth less than I initially thought.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of 4:6 doesn't seem fair to me, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable ratio to myself, but still a relatively even split."
