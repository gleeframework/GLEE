Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'll take 60 this time, and you can have 40.  It's only fair we both get a chance to be the 'big' earner. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about a 55/45 split? I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be reasonable for me considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to push for a 65/35 split.  It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to increase his share. While a 65/35 split might sound like a compromise, it heavily favors him in the long run.  Alice needs to hold strong and aim for a more equitable split, considering the impact of inflation on her earnings."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  I'm offering you 48 which is more than you'd get if we split 50/50 after inflation.  Let's be realistic and get this deal done.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  We're both losing money with every round.  I'm offering you 30, which is better than what you'd get after another round of inflation.  It's time to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is using classic negotiation tactics, trying to pressure Alice with the ""losing money"" argument. However, accepting 30 dollars at this stage would be a terrible deal for Alice. She needs to stand her ground, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it.  It's the fairest deal considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 
 
It's time for Alice to play hardball.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and further negotiation might not be productive. A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the inflation, is the most fair offer at this point. This sends a clear message to Bob that Alice is serious and won't be lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're frustrated, but we're both losing money with every round.  This time, I'm offering a 75/25 split.  It's a significant concession for me, and it's time to be realistic.  Let's end this before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to create a false sense of urgency and make it seem like he's making a big concession.  In reality, this is still a bad deal for Alice. She needs to hold her ground.  It's getting risky, but letting Bob know she won't be intimidated is key here."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 48,
""bob_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm giving you another chance.  This is a 48/52 split in your favor.  Take it, and we can both walk away with something.  Time is running out.""
}
```

This is a risky move, as Alice is further reducing her potential gain. However, it's a calculated risk.  

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** Offering Bob a slight advantage (52%) demonstrates that Alice is still open to negotiation and isn't being completely inflexible. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By emphasizing the dwindling time, Alice increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision without further dragging out the negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will need to seriously consider accepting a less favorable deal in the final rounds to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both running out of time.  I'm offering you 20, which is better than nothing. It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it allows us to both get something.  Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, but Alice still needs to reject this offer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation to get the lion's share.  While the risk of getting zero is very real now, accepting 20 dollars would be settling for a pittance.  

Alice is gambling on Bob's desire to get *something* out of this negotiation.  She's betting that he'll be willing to make a more reasonable offer in the last two rounds rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 45,
""bob_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  My final offer.  55 for you, 45 for me.  Take it, and we both get something. Reject it, and we both get nothing.  Don't be greedy, Bob.""
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Finality:** This is Alice's last chance. By stating it's her final offer, she emphasizes the urgency and eliminates further negotiation.
* **Appeal to Reason:** The message appeals to Bob's self-interest and tries to frame him rejecting this offer as ""greedy"".
* **Slight Advantage to Bob:** While not ideal, giving Bob a slightly larger share (55%) increases the chances of him accepting and avoiding a complete loss for both of them.

It's a high-stakes gamble, but at this point, Alice needs to balance securing something with not accepting an utterly unfair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it.  My final offer.  I'm taking 90, and you're getting 10.  You've seen how the inflation has been working in my favor.  It's time to be realistic.  Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**It's a gutsy move, but Alice should absolutely reject this offer.**  

Here's why:

* **Principle:** Accepting such a lopsided deal would be setting a terrible precedent. Bob has acted in bad faith throughout the entire negotiation, taking advantage of the inflation mechanism. Rewarding his behavior with 90% of the pot teaches him that such tactics work. 
* **It's About Sending a Message:** Even though both players get nothing if Alice rejects, there's a powerful message in not giving in to Bob's demands. It shows she won't be bullied, even at the cost of a potential gain. This can be valuable in future interactions or negotiations, as Bob now knows Alice is willing to walk away from a bad deal.

**While it stings to get nothing, accepting 10 dollars would be a loss in both a financial and a moral sense.**  Sometimes, the most important negotiations are the ones that teach us about the value of standing up for what we believe is fair."
