Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a serious offer and a chance for you to secure a significant amount. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently offering deals where she gets the lion's share.  While $400,000 is a lot of money,  I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome. The game dynamics suggest Alice might be getting anxious as we progress, making her more likely to concede in future rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer, let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than Alice's previous offers and reasonably close to my own proposals. With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly. It's time to be pragmatic and secure a substantial sum."
