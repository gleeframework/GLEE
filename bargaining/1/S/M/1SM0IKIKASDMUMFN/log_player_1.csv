"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I've included a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and equitable split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given that I'm taking the risk of being the proposer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the split is relatively close, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm willing to take the risk of proposing a new offer in the next round to try and get a more favorable outcome. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split, with me getting $5800 and Bob getting $4200. My message, ""Meet me in the middle,"" suggests that I'm trying to find a compromise between our previous offers. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. Let's see what Bob decides!"
