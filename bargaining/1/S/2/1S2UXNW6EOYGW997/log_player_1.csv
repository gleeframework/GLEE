"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me! I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would receive in this offer are:

* Alice gain: 200,000 x 0.8 = 160,000
* Bob gain: 800,000 x 0.8 = 640,000

I'm not impressed by Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now and make a counteroffer.
