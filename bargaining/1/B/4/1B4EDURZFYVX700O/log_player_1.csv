"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leave Bob with 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm now considering Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
