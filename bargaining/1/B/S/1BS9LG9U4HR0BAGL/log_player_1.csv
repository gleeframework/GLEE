"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 55/45 is a fair split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's not perfect, but it's fair given the current value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which might be a more reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money."
