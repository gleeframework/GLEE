"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30-70 split. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get a bit more. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Oh no, this offer is even worse than the previous ones! I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total amount. I was hoping for a better deal, and I'm not going to settle for this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
