"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally, Bob. This offer is in your best interest considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject the offer and see what Alice proposes in the next round.  While it's close to a fair split, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But with inflation, I believe this is a more equitable split, considering your money will be worth less in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and both benefit.  I propose a perfectly even split. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, accepting the even split is the most sensible choice. The time pressure is real, and the odds of getting a better deal in the next round are slim.  I'll take the guaranteed 500,000."
