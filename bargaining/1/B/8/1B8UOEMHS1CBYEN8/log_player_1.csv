"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a reasonable amount, and I'll take $60. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer.\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with an even split, especially since I initially offered Bob $40 and he rejected it. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a bit more than before. I'll take $58, and Bob can have $42. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair middle ground."
