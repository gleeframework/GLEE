"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob, and he should definitely reject it.  There's a lot more money to be made by negotiating, and Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This offer is much fairer to Bob, giving him the majority of the money. Since Alice's offer was rejected, Bob has leverage, and can offer a division that is much closer to his ideal outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than the first one, Bob should still reject it. Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, and there's a good chance that Bob can negotiate a better deal in the following rounds, especially since her money is depreciating faster than his."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
``` 

This offer is a slight concession from Bob's previous offer, but still gives him the majority of the money.  Alice's money is depreciating faster with each round, so she may be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer than in previous rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is much better than the previous ones, Bob should still reject it.  Alice's money is depreciating rapidly, and Bob can likely secure a better deal in the following rounds.  The game is clearly in Bob's favor at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

Bob continues to offer a slightly less favorable deal than the previous round, aiming to push Alice towards accepting while still maintaining a significant advantage. With Alice's money depreciating at a faster rate, she may be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid losing more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though this offer is a 50/50 split, Bob should still reject it.  The game is clearly in his favor at this point, and he can likely secure a better deal in the following rounds, especially since Alice's money is depreciating rapidly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

This offer is a slight decrease from the previous round, keeping Bob in a position of strength while potentially pushing Alice towards accepting.  With each round, Alice's money loses more value, making her more likely to accept a deal that is less favorable to her than in the early rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but Bob should still reject it.  Alice's money is depreciating rapidly, and with only a few rounds left, Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to reject her offers.  He has leverage, and should exploit it to maximize his gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, but still gives him the majority of the money. It's a calculated risk to maintain his current advantage and hopefully push Alice to accept.  With Alice's money depreciating rapidly, and only a few rounds left, she might be willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer rather than risk getting nothing at all."
