"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a small amount, but I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the early rounds before inflation starts to hurt me too much.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a small share to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  Even with inflation, I'm still better off waiting to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still keeping a large portion for myself. I'm hoping that this will be more appealing to him than the previous round, and will avoid the risk of ending the game with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my initial offer, even with the significant inflation.  I'm rejecting this offer and will continue to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he's better off accepting a slightly smaller portion of the money now, rather than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, aiming for a more balanced split.  The inflation is starting to hurt me, but I believe this is still a good deal for me compared to the risk of getting nothing.  I'm hoping that Bob will start to see the value in a more equitable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable to me, even with the significant inflation. I'm still better off trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I believe I can still get a better outcome if I continue to reject his offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is biting now, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will see that we're both at risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers. This is the most equitable offer I can make while still trying to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not great, and the inflation is really hurting me now.  I'm running out of time, but I'm holding out hope for a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

The pressure is immense, but I'm still trying to hold on to a reasonable share. I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping to reach a compromise before it's too late. This is a significant concession for me, but I need to find a way to make Bob see the value in a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, as inflation has taken a serious toll on my potential gains. However, with only 2 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, even though it's considerably less than I initially hoped for."
