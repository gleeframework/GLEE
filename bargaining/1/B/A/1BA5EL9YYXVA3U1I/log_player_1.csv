I'm going to start with a fair but advantageous offer. I want to maximize my share while still being reasonable enough to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'll let him make another offer.  I'm not giving up 90% of the money just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still keeping a significant portion of the money. I think it's a reasonable offer that Bob will be tempted to accept.  If not, I'm prepared to keep negotiating."
