Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Start with a fair share, let's see if we can do better from here""
}
```

I'm starting with a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
