Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared for him to counter-offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is going to make this offer worth less in the next round. Accepting now is the best way to maximize my gains."
