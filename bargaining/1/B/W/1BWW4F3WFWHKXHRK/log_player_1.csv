I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the one proposing, I'm taking a larger share, but I'm giving Bob a decent amount to hopefully incentivize acceptance."

Bob's offer is still too high.  We're getting closer to the middle, though, so I'm going to keep rejecting for now, hoping to force him to be more reasonable with inflation hurting him more than me."

I'm lowering my offer again to 75/25. Bob's offer was too high, and I'm hoping that with the inflation taking a bigger bite out of his potential gains, this offer will be enticing enough."
