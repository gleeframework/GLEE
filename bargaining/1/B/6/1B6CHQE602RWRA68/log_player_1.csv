"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80% and you get 20% in this first round.""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, but it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000
* Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'm not too thrilled about giving up more than I would have in the previous round, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
