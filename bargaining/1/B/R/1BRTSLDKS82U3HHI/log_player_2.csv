Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy, Bob. This offer is still heavily in your favor considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 145000 
# Alice gain: 855000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.  Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 240000 
# Alice gain: 760000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but the offer is still not good. We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is on her more than me because of the inflation hitting her value harder. I need to hold strong for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure we both face.""} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm also drawing a firm line in the sand. Alice is running out of time and her potential gains are shrinking.  This offer represents a strong position for me, and it's unlikely she can do much better in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. 
# Bob gain: 330000 
# Alice gain: 670000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but her offer is still far from ideal.  While she's right that we both lose if we reach round 12, I'm willing to take that risk.  My offer in the previous round was more than fair, and I'm betting she'll become more desperate as time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. This is a compromise considering the circumstances. We both win if you accept.""} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm lowering my demand slightly to entice Alice while still aiming for a favorable outcome.  We're entering the final stages, and she'll be feeling the heat of the shrinking pot. This offer keeps the pressure on while showing a willingness to negotiate."
