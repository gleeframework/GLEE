"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, given the inflation factor. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 54-46 is a fair compromise!""
}
```"
