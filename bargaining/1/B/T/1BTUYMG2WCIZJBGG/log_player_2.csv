"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in each round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a split that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, accepting this ensures I get something and avoids further inflation. The potential gains from continuing are outweighed by the risk of getting nothing at all."
