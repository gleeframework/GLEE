"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as generous, the inflation is severely impacting my returns. Accepting 45 dollars now would be significantly devalued compared to the earlier rounds. I need to push for a better split while there's still a chance to salvage a decent amount."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at my gains. I need you to be realistic. This offer gives you a reasonable share, and ensures I don't get completely fleeced by the inflation.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, inflation or not, I won't go lower 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  

This is getting critical.  Alice's offer is barely better than before, and the value of the money for me is plummeting.  While she claims this is her bottom line, I need to make one last stand to try and secure a better deal before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  You're pushing me to the edge with the clock ticking. I need a larger share to compensate for the heavy inflation. It's this or we both walk away with nothing.""

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I won't budge, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough pill to swallow, but with the time pressure and relentless inflation, I have no choice. If I reject this, it's very likely we'll both walk away with nothing in the end. Taking 48, while significantly devalued, is better than getting nothing at all.  Alice is playing hardball, but I need to be realistic at this point."
