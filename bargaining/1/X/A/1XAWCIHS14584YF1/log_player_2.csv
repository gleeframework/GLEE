Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you want more.  I'm willing to give you a bigger piece, but it's still not fair to me. Let's settle for 55/45.  If we keep going, I'll be getting less and less, and we'll never get to a fair agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
