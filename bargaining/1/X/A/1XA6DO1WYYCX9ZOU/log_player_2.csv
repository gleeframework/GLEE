"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to keep most of the money, but I'm willing to give you a small share to get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While 100,000 is a significant sum, there's no guarantee Alice will offer more in the next round.  Since I'm aware of the inflation, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have to share the money. This way, we both get a good amount and we can move on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share due to the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, and after taking inflation into account, it's likely I won't get a better deal.  It's a reasonable compromise that ensures we both get a decent share."
