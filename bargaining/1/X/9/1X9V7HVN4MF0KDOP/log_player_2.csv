"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 560000,
""alice_gain"": 440000,
""message"": ""I understand the need for fairness considering potential losses. How about this slightly adjusted split?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Considering Time Value:** I'm aware that delaying means losing money for both of us. However, Alice's initial offer heavily favored her.
* **Strategic Counter:** My offer is still tilted in my favor, but it acknowledges the time pressure and offers a more balanced approach than Alice's initial proposal. 
* **Aiming for Agreement:** This offer is designed to start a negotiation. It signals that I'm willing to compromise, but not to the extent Alice initially proposed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing loss, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  We're now in round 3, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Alice's Movement:**  Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Avoiding Greater Loss:** While not perfect, this offer provides a reasonable gain considering the time pressure and potential for further devaluation."
