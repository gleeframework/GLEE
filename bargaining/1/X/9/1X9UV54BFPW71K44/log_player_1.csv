"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm keeping $600,000, which is a 60% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

My gain would be $300,000 (20% less than $600,000), and Bob's gain would be $700,000 (5% less than $740,000, but actually 5% less than $700,000, which is 700,000 - 0.05*700,000 = 700,000).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather have more money, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain would be 60% of the remaining amount, which is:

$300,000 (20% less than $300,000)

I'll offer Bob $700,000, which is 70% of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. Don't leave me with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain would be $200,000, which is 48.8% less than $600,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain would be $100,000 (48.8% less than $200,000).

I'll offer Bob $900,000, which is 90% of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""bob_gain"": 900000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Make a decision!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I'm not going to get left with nothing. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing my potential gain. My gain would be $50,000, which is 67.23% less than $300,000.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation. Bob's offer is a very small share, but it's better than nothing.
