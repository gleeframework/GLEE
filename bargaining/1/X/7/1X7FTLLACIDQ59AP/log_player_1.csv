"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. This is a very generous offer considering the inflation risk, and I hope Bob will see the value in taking it early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than what I offered in the previous round, it is still unfavorable to me.  The inflation rate is significant, and I can likely secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate and the fact that I'm taking the risk of making the proposal. I believe Bob should be willing to accept this offer as it's better than his previous offer."
