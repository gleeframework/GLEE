Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm confident Bob will be willing to take a smaller portion to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I get less than my original proposal, accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. The inflation will continue to devalue the money, and I don't know how much more Bob will be willing to concede."
