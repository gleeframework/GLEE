"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but I'd rather not wait and lose more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
