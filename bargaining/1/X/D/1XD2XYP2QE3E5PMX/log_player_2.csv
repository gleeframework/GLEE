Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Time is starting to become a factor. While ideally, I want more than 50%, Alice seems unwilling to budge much. I'll reject this offer to show I'm serious about a more even split, but I might have to concede a bit in the next round if she doesn't significantly move towards 50/50."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option at this point. With each round, the value of my potential gains decreases substantially. If I reject this and we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, I risk losing everything. It's better to secure a smaller gain now than risk ending up with nothing."
