"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a generous starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I know that the money loses value with each round, but I'm willing to risk it to try and get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were too generous last round. I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up much. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer means I get a significant amount of money. I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, especially with the increasing inflation."
