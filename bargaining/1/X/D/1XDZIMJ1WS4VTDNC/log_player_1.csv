"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation risk in mind, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too generous. This time, I'll offer a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round. I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up much.""
}
```"
