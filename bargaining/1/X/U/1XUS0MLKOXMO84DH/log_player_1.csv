Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was hoping for a slightly more uneven split, given that I'm the one making the initial proposal. I'll pass on this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the highest amount I was hoping for, it's a decent compromise, and I think it's a fair deal. I'll take $5,200 and Bob can have $4,800. Let's finalize the deal!"
