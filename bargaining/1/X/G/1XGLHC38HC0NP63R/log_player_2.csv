Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more this time 
# Bob gain: 3500

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, accepting is the most rational decision. Here's why:

* **Dwindling Returns:** Due to the 20% inflation per round, the value of my potential gains is rapidly decreasing. Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers.
* **Alice's Strength:** Alice knows time is on her side.  Her offers have been getting progressively worse for me, and she has no incentive to offer more.

While $3,000 is significantly less than what I could have gotten earlier, it's better to secure something now than risk ending up with an even smaller amount, or potentially nothing at all if the game continues."
