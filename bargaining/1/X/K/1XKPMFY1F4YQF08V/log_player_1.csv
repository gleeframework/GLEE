"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm thinking I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the best way to start.  We can always adjust things later if we need to. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up my potential for a larger share just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll pass on this offer and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money decreasing by 10% each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You were willing to give me 500,000 last round, so I'm willing to give you a bit less this round. But I'm still thinking I deserve the majority.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 60:40 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go back to my previous offer, Alice.  We both lose money with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to go back to his previous offer. I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50/50 split this time, as it's likely that the value of the money will continue to decrease and we'll both end up with less if we don't agree on a split soon."
