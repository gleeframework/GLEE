"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 60% is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher share, given the inflation and the possibility of getting nothing in future rounds, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option."
