"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 45 (since 50 is 10% more than 45).

I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation, but I'll assume he's not. In that case, his 50 is still worth 50 to him.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me. I'd rather get a bit more to compensate for the inflation. So, I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 in the previous round is worth 45 to me. I'll aim to get a bit more than that to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
