"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm the one proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm confident I can get a better deal. Since the inflation only affects Bob, I'll hold out for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose a 7000/3000 split in my favor. Bob's offer was fair but I'm still hoping for a larger share, and the pressure of inflation might lead him to accept a slightly less favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is getting less appealing each round due to inflation, and I'm confident I can hold out for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split, moving a little closer to Bob's previous proposal. This seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the increasing inflation and the limited rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, but I still believe I can secure a better deal. Inflation is working against him, and I'm confident I can leverage that to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to concede a bit more ground to secure a deal. A 6000/4000 split feels like a fair compromise given the inflation and Bob's diminishing gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but I still believe I can secure a better deal. With only a few rounds remaining, I'm confident I can hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  While I still believe I could get a better deal,  the risk of getting nothing is increasing.  This seems like a reasonable compromise to secure a deal and avoid the potential of a complete loss."
