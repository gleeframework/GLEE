"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep 90% for myself and give 10% to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have a lot of rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The inflation is a significant factor, and continuing to reject offers could lead to getting nothing in the end."
