"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, you get nothing!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, but I'm willing to share a bit to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 90% of the money just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
