Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will propose an even worse deal in the next round due to the inflation effect.  It's better to take the 500,000 now and secure something."
