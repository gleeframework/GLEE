Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000

```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since my share is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to increase my share to make up for the lost value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.
