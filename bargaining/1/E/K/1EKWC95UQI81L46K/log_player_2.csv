"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk. We can discuss a better split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me! While Alice loses value faster than I do, it's worth holding out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split. Take this offer while it's still worthwhile for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing an even split. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is getting desperate and the deal is rapidly getting worse for both of us. An even split is a decent outcome at this point."
