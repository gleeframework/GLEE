"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. It's still a significant imbalance, and while I recognize the inflation is impacting the value, I'm not willing to settle for such a low share so early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I want to ensure a fair return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, I'm still not satisfied with a 40/60 split. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. With the inflation factor rapidly increasing, I believe a fair and even distribution is the only way to ensure both of us gain something in the end."
