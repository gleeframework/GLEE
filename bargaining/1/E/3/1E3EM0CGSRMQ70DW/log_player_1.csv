Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer.  I propose that I receive $999,999 and Bob receives $1. While I recognize this may seem unfair, it is a good starting point.  I am aware of the inflation, and I want to maximize my gains while still giving Bob a small opportunity to share in the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
