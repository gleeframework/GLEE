"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me.  I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to see if I can get a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share in later rounds, Alice, but I need a better starting point. This offer still leaves you with a significant amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, while still leaving me with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more agreeable split, but the inflation is working strongly in my favor now.  Another round or two and she'll be feeling more pressure to concede."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This offer is still reasonable, but I can't be as generous as the rounds go on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's find a compromise before we both get nothing. This offer gives you a larger share but still allows me to get something. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the same offer I made in Round 2, but due to inflation, it's actually more favorable to me now.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and this is a reasonable deal before things get too risky."
