"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money to start. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept."
