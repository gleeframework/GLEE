I propose keeping 90% of the money for myself and giving Bob 10%. This is a reasonable starting point, as it reflects a significant advantage for me but still offers Bob something. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as he'll have more incentive to agree sooner rather than later due to inflation."
