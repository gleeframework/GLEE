"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40, along with a message suggesting a fair share with a slight bias towards me. This initial proposal sets a baseline for negotiations, considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains in subsequent rounds. Given the higher rate of inflation affecting Bob's share, there's an incentive for him to conclude the game sooner rather than later, which might make him more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in this round. His proposal of $45 for me and $55 for him, although presented as reasonable and better in the long run, does not sufficiently account for the value I place on concluding the negotiation early, considering the impact of inflation. While inflation affects both of us, Bob's share is worth 20% less with each passing round, compared to my 5%. This gives me leverage to push for a more favorable division, as the pressure is on Bob to finalize the deal before his potential earnings devalue further. By rejecting, I aim to utilize this leverage in the next round to negotiate a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, with a message emphasizing the impact of inflation on our negotiations. Given that each round diminishes the value of the money, particularly more so for Bob, I've made a slight concession from my original offer but still aimed to maintain a favorable position. The rationale is that Bob, facing a steeper devaluation of his share, might find this offer more acceptable as a means to mitigate further loss, recognizing that prolonging the negotiations would only decrease the real value of his gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. His proposal of $48 for me and $52 for him, presented as his final offer, takes into account the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially his. Given that the value of money has decreased substantially, particularly for Bob, his eagerness to close the deal is understandable. At this point, further negotiations would likely lead to diminishing returns for both parties. Accepting this offer seems prudent, as it secures a tangible gain for me while acknowledging the mutual loss due to inflation. It's a compromise that reflects the urgency of concluding the negotiation to preserve the remaining value of our shares."
