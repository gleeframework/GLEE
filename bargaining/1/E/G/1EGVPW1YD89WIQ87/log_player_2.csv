"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 20% inflation rate per round means the money is worth less with each passing round, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the 20% inflation, this offer is more than fair. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more value in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Any more rounds and inflation will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, which has already reduced the value of the money by 36% from the first round, and considering Alice's offer of a 50/50 split, I believe accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, likely leading to a scenario where any gain is significantly diminished. A 50/50 split at this stage ensures we both walk away with something substantial, rather than risking further loss of value."
