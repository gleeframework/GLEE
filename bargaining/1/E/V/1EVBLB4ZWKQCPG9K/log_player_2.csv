Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going for a slightly larger share, hoping Alice will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is lower than what I initially wanted, it's still better than what I'd get after another round of inflation.  Plus,  Alice is taking a much bigger hit from inflation than I am. I think this is a good deal for me."
