Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I need a bit more than that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, the rapid inflation means I need to aim higher to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair. 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject and the value drops further.  Alice knows she has the upper hand with the inflation working in her favor."
