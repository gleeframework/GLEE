"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:2 in my favor. This ensures a fair share while also securing a reasonable gain for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. This offer gives you a smaller share, but still a majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
