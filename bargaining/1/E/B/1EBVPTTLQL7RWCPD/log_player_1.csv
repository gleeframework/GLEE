I'm not willing to accept such a small share, even if it's the last round. I'll try to make one final offer that tries to salvage what's left.

However, since it's the last round, I'll make a new offer that will be my final attempt to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll be left with nothing.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared for the possibility that we'll both end up with nothing."
