I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the first offer.  Let's see what you think, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want a bigger share after Bob's unfair proposal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's getting risky, and a 45/55 split is better than risking losing more due to inflation.  Let's take it."
