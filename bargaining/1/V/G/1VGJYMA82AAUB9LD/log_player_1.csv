"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to see how he responds and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation makes the money worth less.  Accepting 50/50 ensures I get something and avoids risking getting even less in future rounds."
