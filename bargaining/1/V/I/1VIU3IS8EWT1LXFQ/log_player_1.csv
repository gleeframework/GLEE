"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent amount to start.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more balanced proposal. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6000 is actually worth $4800 in real value.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see a more favorable offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $8000 in the first round is now worth $6400 in real value. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You've been stingy so far, I'll take a bit more this time. Don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time for a fair and equal split. No more games. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the 20% inflation in each round, my initial $8000 is now worth $128.00 in real value.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

An equal split seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the rapidly decreasing value of money."
