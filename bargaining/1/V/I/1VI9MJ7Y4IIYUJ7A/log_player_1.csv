"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth less than before.

I'll think for a moment... Taking only $2,000 is a pretty low offer, considering the initial amount was $10,000. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth even less, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better share. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer is a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger risk and offer a smaller share to you. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled with taking only $1,000, but it's still better than nothing. However, I'm not sure if I should take this risk, as it's a very uneven split.

I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

However, I'll also try to be more realistic and consider the fact that Bob has been pushing for a smaller share for me in his previous offers.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a better deal than $1,000. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

This offer is a 30-70 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to him than my previous offers."
