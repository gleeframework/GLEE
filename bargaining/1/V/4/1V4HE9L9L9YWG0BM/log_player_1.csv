"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Let's divide the money 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him the majority of the money, especially considering the reduced value of the money I'll be getting. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still want a slight edge. Let's divide the money 42-58 in my favor.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $4,200 and Bob will get $5,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair division. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4,000 and call it a day."
