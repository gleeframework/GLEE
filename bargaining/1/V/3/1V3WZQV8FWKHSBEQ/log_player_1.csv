Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep $900,000 for myself and give $100,000 to Bob. Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though I'm getting less than I originally proposed, it's still a lot of money and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round.  I'll take it!"
