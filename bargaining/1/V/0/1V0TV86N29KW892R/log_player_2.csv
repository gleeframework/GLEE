"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we have plenty of rounds to even things out. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation rates.  Rejecting will allow me to propose a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is fair given the upcoming inflation rates.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the increasing inflation. Let's try a 60/40 split this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation rates are hitting me harder than they are hitting Alice, so I need to secure a larger share to compensate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""It's getting late, and the inflation is hitting us both hard.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, and if we don't agree soon, the value of our shares will continue to plummet.""}
