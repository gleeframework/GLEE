"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this offer and we can move on with our lives.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so the actual amount I'd gain is $7,500 (5000 / 0.95). Bob's gain is worth 20% less, but I don't know the exact amount he'd gain.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I'm working with is $7,500 (7,500 / 0.95).

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Consider this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, Alice. I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'd gain is $6,720 (4000 / 0.8526). Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, but I don't know the exact amount he'd gain.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5

  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair, Bob. This offer gives you a decent chunk of change, but I need to make sure I get something too.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down. I want the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'd gain is $5,880 (3000 / 0.7738). Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less, but I don't know the exact amount he'd gain.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob the majority of the money, but I'm running out of time and options. I'd rather take a smaller share than risk getting nothing.
