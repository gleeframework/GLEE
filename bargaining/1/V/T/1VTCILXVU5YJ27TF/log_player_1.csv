"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, Alice. I'll take 50% and you take 50% 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, considering the initial offer was 60-40. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is fair, considering my initial proposal. Can we try to find a compromise between 60-40 and 50-50?""
}

Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between 60-40 and 50-50. How about 55-45?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You'll get 48% and I'll get 52% 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to compromise, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 48-52 split. I was hoping for a bit more, considering the initial offer was 60-40.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 48% is enough for me. Can we try to push for a better deal?""
