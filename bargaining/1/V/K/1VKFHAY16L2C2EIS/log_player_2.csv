Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, I'll meet you halfway on your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out.  She's feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob. It's worth holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is a reasonable offer, and we both lose if we don't agree soon.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By round 6, it's crucial to emphasize the time constraint.  
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 47/53 shows a willingness to compromise slightly from the previous 45/55 offer.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the shared risk of getting nothing if they fail to agree."
