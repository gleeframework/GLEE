"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $57. So, the effective gain for me is $57, and Bob's gain is $70.

I'll accept this offer.
