"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of 450,000 is actually worth 405,000 in real terms, which is a decent chunk of money. But I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.
