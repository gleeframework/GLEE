I'm starting with a fair 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob is happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but 4000 is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise with 4500 for me and 5500 for Bob. This should be a fairer deal for both of us, considering inflation and the previous round's rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to accept such a low amount after my previous compromise attempt. I'll try my luck in the next round and hope for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

I'm going to try a different strategy this time.  Bob seems to be taking advantage of inflation, so I'll offer him the same deal he offered me in round 2, but with a slight increase in his share. This way, I'm acknowledging inflation but not giving up too much."
