"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I propose a 45/55 split. This gives you a significant portion while still being reasonable for me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I still feel I deserve a larger share.  Let's try 57.5/42.5.  This is a more balanced split, considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful of the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly.  My final offer is 47/53.  It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""}
