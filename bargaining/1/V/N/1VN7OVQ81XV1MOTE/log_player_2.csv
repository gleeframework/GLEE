Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice is getting bolder. While her offer is closer to the middle, the impact of inflation is severe.  Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to what I could have gained in earlier rounds. I need to push for a more favorable outcome, knowing that the pressure is on for both of us as we approach the final rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it - we both lose out if we continue.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a 50/50 split.  This is a strong, fair offer, and the ""take it or leave it"" language emphasizes the urgency. Alice knows the stakes are getting higher, and while she's been stubborn, the risk of getting nothing might compel her to finally accept a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one more chance to accept a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge further, and the impact of inflation is becoming devastating. While 440,000 is far from ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing, which is increasingly likely as we approach the final rounds. Accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees a payout, even if it's heavily in Alice's favor."
