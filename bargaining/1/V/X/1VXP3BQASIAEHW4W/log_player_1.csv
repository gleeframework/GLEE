"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 70/30, a more reasonable offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about the 30% share, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll come up with something more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, 50/50, a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the opportunity to get more. However, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I think it's a good idea to take what I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50/50 split and hope it's the best I can get!"
