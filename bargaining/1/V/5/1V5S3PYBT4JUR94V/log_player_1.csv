"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my next offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than meeting in the middle.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
