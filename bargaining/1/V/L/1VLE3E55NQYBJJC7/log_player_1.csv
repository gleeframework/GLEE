"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller amount (1000$). Since it's the first round, I'm taking a bit of a gamble that Bob will accept, but I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer of 5000$ is significantly better than what I would get if I reject and have to make a counter-offer. The next round my share will be worth even less, so I'll take the 5000$ now."
