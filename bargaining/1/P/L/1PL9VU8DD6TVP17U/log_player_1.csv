"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. I'm trying to negotiate and start the conversation, while also keeping in mind that time is of the essence due to the inflation mechanic. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and we can work from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation hurting us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 50 dollars now is actually worth less than what I could potentially get in the future, even if the nominal amount is lower. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I need to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or use the decreasing value to my advantage in negotiations."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more to compensate for inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $58, while decreasing Bob's share to $42. My message explains that I need to take a bit more to compensate for the 20% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm trying to convey that my increased demand is not just a negotiating tactic, but a necessary adjustment to account for the loss in value. By framing it this way, I'm hoping Bob will understand my perspective and be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time to account for inflation, but we need to reach a compromise soon or we'll both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though he's offering me a slightly larger share than before, the amount is still not enough to compensate for the significant loss in value due to inflation. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round for me, accepting 45 dollars now would be equivalent to a much smaller amount in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal or use the time pressure to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $60, while decreasing Bob's share to $40. My message emphasizes that time is running out and we need to reach a deal soon. I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this offer, as the decreasing value of the money due to inflation is becoming more significant with each passing round. By offering a slightly larger share to myself, I'm hoping to account for the loss in value and still come out with a reasonable amount.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time's running out, let's settle on this""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We're losing money with each round, and we need to make a deal now.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need to ensure I get enough to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think this is the best deal I can get. With the money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round for me, accepting 40 dollars now is actually equivalent to a much smaller amount in the first round. However, since Bob has framed this as his final offer, I believe that rejecting it would lead to further losses in the next round, and potentially even no deal at all. By accepting this offer, I'm at least securing some amount of money, even if it's not ideal."
