Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is hurting us both. I'm offering you $40. This is more than you would have gotten last round if I accepted, and with inflation, waiting longer will only hurt us more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
