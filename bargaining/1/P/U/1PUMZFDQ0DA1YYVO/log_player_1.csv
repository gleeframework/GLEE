"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that this split is fair, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal.

```

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% toll, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

```

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.
