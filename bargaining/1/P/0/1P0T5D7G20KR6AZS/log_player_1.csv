"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, leaving Bob with a decent amount of money, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

In this round, my gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). I notice that Bob's offer is the same as in round 3, but considering the inflation, my gain is worth less than before.

I'll reject this offer as well, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round (100% - 59.04% = 40.96%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 409600,
  ""bob_gain"": 590400
}
```"
