"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent chunk of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, huh?

I'll think about it... 

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
