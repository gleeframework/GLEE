"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose taking a larger share upfront, considering the money devalues more rapidly for you with each round, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this split is fair, considering the devaluation of the money for both of us. Let's end this game.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. I'm proposing a more balanced offer this time, factoring in the ongoing devaluation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the devaluation is significant, and this offer gives me a decent amount. It's time to end the game and secure my gains."
