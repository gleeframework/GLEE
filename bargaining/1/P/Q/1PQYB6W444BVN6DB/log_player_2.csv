"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. I'll take most of the money, but you get a small portion to start. It's a good foundation for the next round. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While getting something is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better split. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. I'll take less than I initially offered, but I need a more equitable share.  Let's make this work. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is coming around, but this is still not an ideal split. We're running out of time, but I think I can get her closer to a 50/50 split, especially with the inflation pressure mounting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's settle this.  52/48 split in my favor. Time is running out, and the money is losing value with every passing round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. We're both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is a fair deal! It's better to accept now before inflation eats away at the value even more."
