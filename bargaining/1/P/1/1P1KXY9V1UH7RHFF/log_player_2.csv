**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely cutting into Bob's potential gains. While accepting Alice's offer means getting a worse deal than previously offered, rejecting it risks even further losses.  

Here's why accepting is the less risky option:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round sees a smaller increase in the inflation penalty, but the potential gains from holding out are also shrinking.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has shown no willingness to budge significantly on her share. It's unlikely she'll offer a better deal in the future.
* **Guaranteed Loss:** Rejecting this offer guarantees a worse outcome for Bob if Alice proposes an even slightly less favorable split in the next round.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and ends the game before inflation eats away even more of his potential earnings."
