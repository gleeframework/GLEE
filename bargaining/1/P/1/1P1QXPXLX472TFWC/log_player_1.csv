"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the smaller share this round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took the smaller share last round, now it's my turn to propose a smaller share for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give you the majority this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to spin the story to make it sound like he's doing me a favor!

However, I notice that his offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is the same as my previous offer. Given that the money he gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me out again!
