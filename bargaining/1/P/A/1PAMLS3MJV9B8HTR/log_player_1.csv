"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd get $4,800 in today's money. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so he'd get $3,800 in today's money.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. Since I'd be getting more than my adjusted gain from the previous round, I'd be better off accepting this offer.
