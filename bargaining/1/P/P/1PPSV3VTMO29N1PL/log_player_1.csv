"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of 6000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.
