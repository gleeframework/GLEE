Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
