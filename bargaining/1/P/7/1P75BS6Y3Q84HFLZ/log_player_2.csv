"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Consider this a gentle offer. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a small gain, 2000$ is a very small percentage of the total. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation risk means I need to be strategic and hold out for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  We both get a good share, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations. Consider this a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer makes sense.  Inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  Getting 4500 now is better than risking getting nothing later."
