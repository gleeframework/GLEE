"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Alice's gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (in Round 1 value)
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 (in Round 1 value)

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
