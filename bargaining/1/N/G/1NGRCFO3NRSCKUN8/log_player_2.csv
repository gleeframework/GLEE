"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's rules and the impact of inflation on both players.
In this game, Bob and Alice take turns proposing divisions of $100. With each round, the value of the money does not change for Bob but decreases by 20% for Alice.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's first offer and the reasoning behind rejecting it.
Alice's initial offer was to take 90% and give Bob 10%. This offer was rejected because it's highly skewed in Alice's favor, and given the game's structure, there's room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome for Bob.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's perception of the money's value.
Since the money's value decreases by 20% for Alice with each round, any offer made in subsequent rounds will be perceived as less valuable to her than in the previous rounds. This dynamic can be leveraged to negotiate a more favorable deal for Bob.

### Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer that takes into account the game's dynamics.
Bob should make an offer that is more equitable but still takes advantage of the fact that the money's value decreases for Alice with each round. Aiming for a middle ground that slightly favors Bob due to the negotiation leverage provided by the inflation mechanic could be a strategic move.

### Step 5: Construct the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the strategy outlined, Bob's offer should aim to give him a larger share while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given the decreasing value of the money for her.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}"
