"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to keep up with the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'll have to be careful. Bob's offer seems a bit more generous than before, but I'm not sure if it's enough to compensate for the lost value. I'll think about it...

After some consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.
