Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a fair deal. Let's stop wasting time with inflation eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
