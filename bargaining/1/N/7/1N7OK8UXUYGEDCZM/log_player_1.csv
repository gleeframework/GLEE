"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra for me since I'm taking the first risk.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 split seems reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer might seem fair on the surface, but inflation is working in my favor.  While $5,000 is the same for me in both rounds, it's worth less to Bob now than in the previous round. I should aim for a slightly better deal, knowing his perceived value of the money is decreasing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle, Bob? This deal gets us both a little something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my share slightly from my first offer, recognizing that Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. This offer is still better for him than a 50/50 split in the next round, considering the 10% devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 55/45, with me taking the larger share this time. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and overvaluing his position.  While a 55/45 split seems like a compromise, the inflation means that his $5,500 is worth significantly less than what he could have gotten in earlier rounds. I need to hold firm and aim for a deal that reflects the actual value of the money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm nudging my share up again, making it clear I'm aware of the decreasing value for Bob. This offer is still a compromise, as it gives him more than he'd get in a 50/50 split with the increasing inflation.  The message also emphasizes the time pressure, pushing him towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. I'm offering you 40% and taking 60% to account for the inflation. This is the best deal I can offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is panicking. While his offer acknowledges the inflation, he's significantly undervaluing the money now.  A 60/40 split in his favor might have been a decent deal for him a few rounds ago, but now, his $6,000 is worth much less.  I need to hold my ground and make it clear that I won't accept a deal that doesn't reflect the current state of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is the same offer I gave you in Round 1.  The clock is ticking, and it's getting worse for you every round. Don't be greedy.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to go back to my original offer and emphasize how much Bob stands to lose by continuing to decline.  He needs to realize that his negotiating position weakens with every passing round. By highlighting the difference between his potential gain in Round 1 versus now, I hope to push him toward a rational decision."
