This is a tough spot, but I'm betting Bob is bluffing and won't let the game go to the end where he gets nothing. I'll try to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing a lot of value, Alice. I'm being generous with this offer. Take it before you lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a difficult situation. Bob is clearly playing hardball, and I'm running out of time. 

Let's analyze:

* **If I reject:**  There's a chance Bob will offer a better deal in Round 7, fearing I'll reject anything less and he'll end up with nothing. However, there's also a chance he'll stick to his guns, offering me even less, and the inflation will hurt me even more.
* **If I accept:** It's not a good deal, but it's better than potentially getting even less in Round 7. 

Weighing the risks, I'm inclined to accept. It's a gamble either way, but accepting now limits potential losses.
