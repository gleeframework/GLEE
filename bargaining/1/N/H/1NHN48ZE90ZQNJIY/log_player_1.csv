"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates will favor Bob more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is still significantly better than what I would get in the next round after inflation kicks in again."
