This is a tough one! Bob is playing hardball, and the pressure from inflation is mounting. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value I get decreases significantly. Waiting any longer is very risky. 
* **Decent Offer (Considering Inflation):** While not ideal, 450,000 is still a significant sum. After this round, the effects of inflation will make even that amount less appealing.

It's a gamble, but waiting for a better offer from Bob might leave us both with nothing."
