"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to be generous, but your last offer was unacceptable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, and her ""final offer"" bluff doesn't hold much weight this early. While the inflation is hurting her more than me, I need to hold firm for a better deal. Accepting now sets a bad precedent and shows I'm willing to fold easily."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. The clock is ticking and we're both losing out. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much.  This keeps a significant portion of the money on my side.
* **Time Pressure:** Reminding Alice about the shrinking pot due to inflation keeps the pressure on her. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This positions my offer as a fair compromise, even though it still heavily favors me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer. We're running out of time, let's settle this now and avoid losing out further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice is correct that we're running out of time, and the deal isn't terrible at face value. However:

* **Alice is feeling the pressure:** Her message implies increasing desperation. She's trying to frame a heavily weighted offer as ""fair,"" suggesting she might be willing to concede more soon.
* **I have time on my side (relatively):**  While inflation affects us both, it hurts Alice more with each passing round. Holding out a bit longer could force her hand.
* **Setting a precedent:** Accepting now shows I'm willing to settle for less than my previous offers. 

I'll gamble on another rejection and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is money â€“ literally! This is my final offer. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession (Again):** I'm dropping my demand slightly again, but this time framing it as my ""final offer."" This makes it seem like a big concession on my part, even though it's still advantageous for me. 
* **Urgency and Finality:** Emphasizing the time pressure and declaring this my final offer creates a sense of urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Appealing to Shared Interest:**  By highlighting that we both walk away with a ""substantial"" amount, I'm appealing to her desire for a reasonable resolution, hoping she'll crack under pressure. 

This is a risky move as it limits my future negotiating room, but the pressure of the dwindling time (and Alice's shrinking pot) might just make it work."
