"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to think carefully.

Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd rather not wait and try to get a better deal. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
