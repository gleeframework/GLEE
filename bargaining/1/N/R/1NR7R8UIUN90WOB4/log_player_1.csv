"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 600000 * 0.95 = 570000
Bob gain: 400000 * 0.95 = 380000

I accept this offer.
