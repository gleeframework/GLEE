Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm looking for a more balanced split, but I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives us an equal share, but I'm open to negotiations.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
