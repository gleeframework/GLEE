"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly bigger share this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep the game going."
