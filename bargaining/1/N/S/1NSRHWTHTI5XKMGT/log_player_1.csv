I'm going to start with a fairly greedy proposal, hoping Bob will want to secure something rather than risk getting nothing if we keep going.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and in my best interest. I can't be sure I'll get anything better in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing isn't worth it."
