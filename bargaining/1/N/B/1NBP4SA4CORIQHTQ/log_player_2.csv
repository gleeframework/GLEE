Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but don't get too greedy 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a reasonable offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time too, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with time running out, accepting this offer would mean I get less than half of the original amount after inflation. My offers have been reasonable, and Alice's decreasing gains might push her towards a better deal for me soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice. Let's split it right down the middle.  Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a serious factor.  While I could push for a slightly larger gain, a 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing if negotiations fail completely."
