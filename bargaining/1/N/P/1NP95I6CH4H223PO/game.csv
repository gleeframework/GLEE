60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split.  Let's go for a more balanced 55/45 and see where things go from there.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
57.0,43.0,"I see you want a more balanced split, but I think I can do a bit better than 45. Meet me in the middle of our two offers?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split the difference and go for a clean 50/50.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, and I think this is the fairest way to ensure we both get something out of this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
58.0,42.0,"I understand you're feeling the pinch from inflation, but I'm not. A 50/50 split doesn't account for my stronger position. Let's try this slightly revised split.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
55.0,45.0,"We're both losing value with each round.  Let's compromise a bit - I'll go down to 45, but I'm hoping you can meet me halfway with a 55/45 split.  This is the best we can do with inflation hitting my share so hard.",Bob,6,
