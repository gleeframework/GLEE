"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a reasonable split, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the money is losing value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split.  Let's go for a more balanced 55/45 and see where things go from there."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want a more balanced split, but I think I can do a bit better than 45. Meet me in the middle of our two offers? 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I appreciate Alice's compromise, I'm still losing too much value due to inflation. I'm hoping to get closer to my original 55/45 split before the value drops even further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the difference and go for a clean 50/50.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, and I think this is the fairest way to ensure we both get something out of this."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling the pinch from inflation, but I'm not. A 50/50 split doesn't account for my stronger position. Let's try this slightly revised split. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse for me with each round, while the inflation is continuing to hurt my end of the deal.  I'm hoping to hold out for a better offer or at least a split that reflects the inflation impact."

{
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""We're both losing value with each round.  Let's compromise a bit - I'll go down to 45, but I'm hoping you can meet me halfway with a 55/45 split.  This is the best we can do with inflation hitting my share so hard.""
