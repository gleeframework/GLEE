"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  After all, he's getting something and it's better than getting nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's still getting a much larger share, and I know that he's going to be losing money on his share with each round.  It's time for me to take the lead and make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than he offered me, but it's still more than he would get with each passing round.  I'm confident he'll take it to avoid further losses."
