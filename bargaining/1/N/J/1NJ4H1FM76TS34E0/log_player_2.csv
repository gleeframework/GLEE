"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to make a counteroffer, but since that's not an option in this format, I'll reject and wait for the next round to make my own proposal. Alice's offer isn't bad, but I think I can negotiate a better deal considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more to offset the loss of value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast. I'll meet you in the middle, but we need to agree soon before the value drops further for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer because, although Alice is meeting me in the middle, the value of the money has dropped significantly for me due to inflation. I need a better deal to account for this loss in value. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I understand the urgency, but the inflation is really affecting my end. I need a bit more to make it worth continuing. This is as fair as I can offer under the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous. We're running out of time!  Let's just split it evenly and get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, an even split at this point seems like the best option. The value of the money has dropped by 34.39% for me, so getting half of the original amount is a more favorable outcome than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It's time to conclude the game with this offer."
