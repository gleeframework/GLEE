"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, but consider the time value of money. A slightly larger share for me in Round 1 seems reasonable.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a fairer split reflects the value of our time. I'm proposing a slightly larger share for me this round to compensate for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is simply a reversal of Alice's initial offer. While he frames it as ""fair,"" it doesn't acknowledge the asymmetric impact of inflation. By rejecting, Alice signals that she's willing to negotiate but won't accept an offer that disproportionately disadvantages her due to the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5012,
""bob_gain"": 4988,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about the time value of money, but the inflation is impacting me significantly. Let's find a compromise that acknowledges both our positions.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's point about the time value of money, showing she's listening and open to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Inflation:**  She reiterates the impact of inflation on her returns, making it clear this is a key factor in her decision-making. 
* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:** This offer is still slightly in Alice's favor to account for inflation, but it's a significant move towards the middle ground compared to her Round 1 offer. This signals she's willing to negotiate but won't simply accept an offer that disproportionately favors Bob."
