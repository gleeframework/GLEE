"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial 100$, leaving 20% for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can't get a better offer than this! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I need to consider the effective gain in terms of the original value. So, my gain of 70 in this round is equivalent to 70 / 0.8 = 87.5 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best offer I'll get, so I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a slightly better deal than the 70 I would have gotten in the previous round, adjusted for inflation. Let's see...

In the previous round, I would have gotten 87.5 in the first round, so in this round, I'll aim for 70 / 0.8 = 87.5 / 0.8 = 109.375, but since we are working with 100 dollars, I'll adjust my offer to be 80, which is 90 in the first round's value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly better deal than before. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my share too easily! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain in the first round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less, I'll divide 75 by 0.5184 (1 - 0.4816) to get the equivalent value in the first round. 

75 / 0.5184 = 144.87

However, since we are working with 100 dollars, I'll adjust my calculation to account for the reduced value. 

75 / 0.5184 = 144.87 â‰ˆ 100 / 0.5184 = 193.5, but since we are working with 100 dollars, I'll adjust my calculation to be 75.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than I would have gotten in the previous rounds, adjusted for inflation.
