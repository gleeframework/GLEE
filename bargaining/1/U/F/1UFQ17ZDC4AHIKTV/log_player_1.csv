"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leaving $40 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle! That's a reasonable offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the money evenly at $50 each."
