"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer. I'll think for a moment...
