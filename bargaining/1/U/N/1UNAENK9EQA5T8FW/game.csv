5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it 50/50 to start with. A fair and simple approach.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one proposing this time. Let's see if we can agree.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 60/40 is too skewed. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor this time, hoping we can find a middle ground.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair and reasonable solution.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not convinced 55/45 is fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this time, hoping we can find a middle ground.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4250.0,5750.0,"Let's try a 57.5/42.5 split this time. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the increasing inflation that's impacting both of us. We need to reach an agreement soon.",Bob,6,

,,,Bob,7,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"We're running out of time!  The inflation is hurting us both, and we need to find a solution soon. I'm willing to stick with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's time to compromise and end this game before we both lose out.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to give in to a 60/40 split. I'm proposing a 58/42 split in my favor, hoping we can find a compromise before it's too late.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Time is really running out now.  Let's just agree on a 60/40 split - I'm willing to take the risk of a 50/50 split in the next round if we can't agree.  It's better than getting nothing at all.,Bob,10,
