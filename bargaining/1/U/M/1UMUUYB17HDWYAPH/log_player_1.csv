"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try to get the most money I can, but I'm also being careful not to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I know that the money is worth less with each round. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and it avoids the risk of getting even less in a future round."
