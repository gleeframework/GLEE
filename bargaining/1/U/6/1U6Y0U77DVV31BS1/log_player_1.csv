"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving Bob with a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While Bob's offer is much worse for me, it's still too early to give in.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer, but still aiming for a majority of the money. I think this offer is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to take it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. While Bob's offer is getting closer to being fair, I still think I can do better. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. With inflation getting more significant, I believe a fair split is the best way to secure at least some money. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game now."
