Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Think it through - it's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting less later. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
