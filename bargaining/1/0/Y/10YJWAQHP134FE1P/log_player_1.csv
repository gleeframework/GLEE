Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 55/45 split, giving me a slight advantage. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money without risking too much in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my share to 60% this time.  Bob is being greedy, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if we both continue to be stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option. If I reject it, I'll be risking getting nothing in the next round due to the further decrease in value caused by inflation."
