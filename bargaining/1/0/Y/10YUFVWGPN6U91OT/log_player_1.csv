"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split.  This seems like a fair starting point, and it gives Bob some incentive to accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is actually quite good for me! It gives me $100,000, which is better than nothing. I'm sure if I reject this, I'll get less in the next round.  It's a good deal for me!"
