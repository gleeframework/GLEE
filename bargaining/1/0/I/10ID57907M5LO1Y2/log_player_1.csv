"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 50/50. I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially adjusting the split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given that you get to keep your full share while mine is decreasing with each round.  Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his favor.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money I gain remains the same while Bob's share is decreasing in value. I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the original 50/50 split. I'm open to further negotiations, but this is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to reflect the original 50/50 split, while still considering the effects of inflation on Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but I need to get a better share than 4000. Let's agree on 55/45 and end this quickly before things get worse for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but still wants a better share.

I'll consider his proposal...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, as I think I can do better. The money I gain remains the same, and I'm not convinced that Bob's share is sufficient to compensate for the decreasing value of his money. I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original 50/50 split. I'm open to further negotiations, but this is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better share and still getting a fair deal for myself."
