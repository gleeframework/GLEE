"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, which is a significant advantage considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's split the difference. I'm offering 55/45.  Considering inflation, this is still a good deal for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but the inflation is working against me.  I'll meet you halfway at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation. I'll accept it.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
