"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, Bob, but I need to look out for myself too.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to accept Alice's offer in Round 3. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action to minimize further loss of value. Let me know if this concludes the game!"
