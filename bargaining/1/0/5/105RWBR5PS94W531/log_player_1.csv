Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was quite cheeky! Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Consider that your share decreases rapidly with each round.  It's a good deal for you while it lasts! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
