Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It considers the devaluation and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation and our previous offers.  Let's settle this now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
