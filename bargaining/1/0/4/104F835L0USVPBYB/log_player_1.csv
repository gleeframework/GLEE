"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It considers the devaluation and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
