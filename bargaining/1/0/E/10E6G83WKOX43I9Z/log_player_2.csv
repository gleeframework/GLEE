Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Alice is not a winning strategy.  I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable, but I need to be prepared to accept a less-than-ideal offer soon as the inflation will continue to hurt."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to draw a line in the sand. Accepting anything less than 45% at this point would be severely detrimental due to the inflation.  By making this my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal to Alice that I'm serious and won't be swayed by further lowball offers.  She's incentivized to take a deal now, as dragging this out any further doesn't benefit her if I'm truly unwilling to budge."
