"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 75% and you can take 25%. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 ratio in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be the one making the first proposal. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60:40 split, especially considering the money I'll be getting is worth 10% less than it was in the previous round. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but I'm still aiming for a fair share. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55:45 split, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 50:50 split is too even, given the current state of the game. I'd like to try to negotiate for a slightly larger share, especially since the money I'll be getting is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to make sure I get a decent amount. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 48:52 split, trying to find a balance between getting a reasonable share and giving Bob a slightly larger share than before. Your turn, Bob!"
