"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take the higher share now. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
