,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, given that we'll be losing value each round. What do you say?",Bob,2,

350000.0,650000.0,"Let's be realistic, the value is dropping with every round.  A 65/35 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances.  What do you think?",Bob,4,
