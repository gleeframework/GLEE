"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While she's offering slightly more than last round, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a better deal to account for the shrinking pot on my end.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding a little:**  The even split offer didn't work. I need to show some flexibility by offering Alice slightly more than last time.
* **Still firm on the core issue:**  The offer still leans in my favor, reflecting the fact that time is working against me. 
* **Conveying urgency:** The message aims to remind Alice that the longer this goes, the less attractive the overall pie becomes."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to use the pressure of inflation against me. However, her offer is barely budging. Accepting now would mean settling for a much smaller slice of the pie than I'm willing to take.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""This is my final concession. We're running out of time, and I'd rather get something than nothing at all.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Clock is Ticking:** With only a few rounds left, the threat of getting nothing is very real. I need to signal I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise to avoid disaster.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final concession"", I'm creating a sense of urgency and putting the ball firmly in Alice's court. She needs to decide if squeezing a little more out of me is worth the risk of both of us losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, this is as good as it gets 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but with time running out, I have to be realistic. Here's why I'm biting the bullet:

* **Dire Straits:** The inflation is killing me. Accepting a 42/58 split now is significantly better than getting nothing in a few rounds.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Her last offer, tone, and the dwindling time tell me she's dug in.  Trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal now is too risky.  
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  Pride hurts, but walking away with nothing would be a worse outcome."
