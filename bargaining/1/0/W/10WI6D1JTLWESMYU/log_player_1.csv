"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.9 = $360,000
* Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.9 = $540,000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a bit more balanced than the first one. I'll accept this offer.
