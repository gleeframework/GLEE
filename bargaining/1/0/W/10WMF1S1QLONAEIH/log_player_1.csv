Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation. While I need to make a deal soon, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the money. I need to try and push for a better deal in the next few rounds."

# Alice gain: 3900 
# Bob gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being incredibly greedy, but I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer is far from ideal, but rejecting it means risking an even lower offer or even walking away with nothing."
