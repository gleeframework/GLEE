"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going for a slightly aggressive but not overly greedy opening offer.  I want to secure a large share while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal, I believe I can still do better.  Since the money is losing value with each round, I need to secure a larger share. I'll counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a better option than continuing to risk further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's better than the last round, I believe I can still secure a larger share.  I'll counter-propose again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant share, especially considering the rapid inflation.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer before we lose even more value."
