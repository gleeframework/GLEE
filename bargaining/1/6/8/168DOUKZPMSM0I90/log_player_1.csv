"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 720,000 (900,000 * 0.8)
* Bob's gain: 800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8)

Bob's offer in the second round is:

* Alice's gain: 300,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000

This is a worse deal for me than the previous offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 576,000 (720,000 * 0.8)
* Bob's gain: 768,000 (800,000 * 0.8)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than half 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts after the inflation in the first 3 rounds:

* Round 1: 0.8
* Round 2: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64
* Round 3: 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512

So, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value after 4 rounds. The actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 512,000 (576,000 * 0.89, where 0.89 is 51.2% expressed as a decimal)
* Bob's gain: 688,000 (768,000 * 0.89)

Bob's offer in the fourth round is:

* Alice's gain: 450,000
* Bob's gain: 550,000

This is a worse deal for me than the previous offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value. So, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 512,000 (576,000 * 0.89)

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I want more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts after the inflation in the first 5 rounds:

* Round 1: 0.8
* Round 2: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64
* Round 3: 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512
* Round 4: 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096
* Round 5: 0.4096 * 0.8 = 0.32768

So, the money is worth 32.768% of its original value after 6 rounds. The actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 327,680 (512,000 * 0.64, where 0.64 is 32.768% expressed as a decimal)
* Bob's gain: 422,320 (688,000 * 0.64)

Bob's offer in the sixth round is:

* Alice's gain: 400,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000

This is a worse deal for me than the previous offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 7, the money is worth 32.768% of its original value. So, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 327,680 (512,000 * 0.64)

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm making a final push, Alice, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts after the inflation in the first 7 rounds:

* Round 1: 0.8
* Round 2: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64

* Round 4: 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096
* Round 5: 0.4096 * 0.8 = 0.32768
* Round 6: 0.32768 * 0.8 = 0.262144
* Round 7: 0.262144 * 0.8 = 0.2097152

So, the money is worth 20.97152% of its original value after 8 rounds. The actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 20,971.52 (327,680 * 0.064, where 0.064 is 6.4% expressed as a decimal)
* Bob's gain: 26,928.48 (422,320 * 0.064)

Bob's offer in the eighth round is:

* Alice's gain: 380,000
* Bob's gain: 620,000

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'll accept this offer to get some money instead of nothing.
