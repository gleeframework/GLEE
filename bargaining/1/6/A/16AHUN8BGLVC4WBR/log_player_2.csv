"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Alice in later rounds. It's better to take a risk and try to secure a better deal in a later round, even if it means a slightly smaller initial amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the need for fairness given the inflation.  How about this slightly adjusted offer?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Fairness:** I start by acknowledging Alice's concern about fairness regarding inflation. This builds rapport and shows I'm taking her perspective into account.
* **Slight Improvement:** I increase my share slightly to $4,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Early Agreement Incentive:** While I could push for more, settling early has its benefits. Every round that passes reduces the value of the money for both of us. This offer incentivizes Alice to accept now and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching closer, but it's still early in the game. While the inflation is hitting harder, it's also impacting Alice's potential gains in later rounds. Holding out a bit longer could lead to a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This offer minimizes the impact of inflation for both of us.  Let's close the deal and maximize our gains!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  I'm raising my offer to $4,800. This shows significant movement on my part, indicating a strong desire to settle.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** My message emphasizes that this offer benefits both of us by minimizing the negative effects of inflation. This framing can make the deal more palatable for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the rounds. Delaying much longer will significantly erode the value of the money, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger share later."
