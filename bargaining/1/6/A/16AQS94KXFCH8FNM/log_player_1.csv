Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty lopsided offer,  giving myself the majority of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to accept it in the first round, since it's a lot better than getting nothing at the end!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
