I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a measly $1.  I figure he'll be desperate for anything, and it's worth a shot! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'm disappointed that my initial offer was rejected, I'll accept this offer.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds."
