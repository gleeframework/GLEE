"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to leave room for negotiations and a more significant difference in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's now offering me $4,500 (5000 * 0.9) and keeping $4,500 for himself.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
