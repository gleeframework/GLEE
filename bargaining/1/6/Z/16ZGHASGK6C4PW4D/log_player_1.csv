"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  A 50/50 split is too low for me, especially with the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to offer me more to get me to agree before too many rounds pass."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000/2000, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  It's important to keep in mind that the money is losing value with each round, so I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is becoming increasingly greedy, but I'm not giving in to his demands. I'll stick to my strategy of offering a large share for myself and see if he comes around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to 7000/3000, but I believe this is still a fair split considering the inflation.  Bob needs to understand that we're both losing money with every passing round, and a deal is better than nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I refuse to accept a 3000/7000 split, especially considering the inflation that has already taken place. I'm determined to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 6000/4000.  We're both losing money, and I need to start securing a deal before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I refuse to accept a 2000/8000 split, especially considering the inflation that has already taken place. I'm determined to hold out for a better deal."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm lowering my offer to 5000/5000. We are nearing the end, and I want to reach an agreement before we both lose everything. This is a fair and equal split considering the inflation."
