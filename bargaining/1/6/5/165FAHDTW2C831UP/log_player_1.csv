"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'd like to get a slightly better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly better deal, where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
