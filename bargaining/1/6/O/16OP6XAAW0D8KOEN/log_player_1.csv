"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more aggressive offer, let's see if you'll bite 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about whether $3,600 (10% less than $4,000) is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair deal""

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate my actual gain: $3,300 (10% less than $3,600 in round 2, and another 10% less than that in round 3, and then another 27.1% less than that).

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, meet me at this price""

I'll reject this offer, it's getting too one-sided.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's aggressive offers, I'll try to make a more extreme proposal to turn the tables. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking control""
}
```

I'm proposing a highly lopsided split, with $9,000 for me and only $1,000 for Bob. It's a high-risk move, but I'm trying to make Bob sweat."

Round 8

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

With Bob's aggressive offers, I'll try to make a final, bold proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9990,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm proposing an almost ridiculously lopsided split, with $9,990 for me and only $10 for Bob. It's a high-risk move, but I'm trying to force Bob to make a decision."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.

With inflation, my gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate my actual gain: $3,840 (10% less than $4,200 in round 8, and another 10% less than that in round 9, and then another 61.26% less than that).

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and it's better than walking away with nothing.
