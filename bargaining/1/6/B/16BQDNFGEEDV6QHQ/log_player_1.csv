"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the offer from Bob is actually equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 1900
* Bob gain: 7600

I'm not too thrilled about giving up so much, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.
