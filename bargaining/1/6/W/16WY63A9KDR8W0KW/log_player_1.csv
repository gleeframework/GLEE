"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the effective gain for each of us. For me, 45 dollars is equivalent to 50.5 dollars in the previous round, and for Bob, 55 dollars is equivalent to 61.1 dollars in the previous round.

Considering the offers, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his offer, I'll try to make a new proposal that's more favorable to me.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 55 dollars."
