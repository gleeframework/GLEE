I'll start by taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a bit aggressive, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept such an uneven split. If he rejects, we can see how he negotiates in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game!  I'm not going to accept this offer - it's the exact opposite of what I proposed. I want to see if Bob will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Let's try a more fair split. I'll propose an even division, 500,000 for each of us.  I think this is the most reasonable outcome, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
