"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
