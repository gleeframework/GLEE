"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. This is a safe bet since the money is worth less to Bob in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting a smaller share, Bob's offer is still better than the potential outcome of continuing.  The next round would make his offer worth even less to him, making it less likely he'll offer me anything at all."
