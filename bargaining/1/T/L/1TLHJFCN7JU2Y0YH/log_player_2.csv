Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Bob makes a counteroffer that is more favorable to him, but still leaves Alice with a significant amount. He tries to frame it as finding a middle ground, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness. Since the money loses value with each passing round, Bob aims to create a sense of urgency to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a fair deal, Bob. This offer considers the time pressure and the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Bob decides to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Despite the decreasing value of the money, Bob believes he can still negotiate for a better deal, given the significant difference in how inflation affects them. He aims to use the time pressure to his advantage, hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, and inflation is biting. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Bob makes another offer, increasing his share while decreasing Alice's. He emphasizes the urgency of the situation, highlighting the impact of inflation on the value of the money. By framing his offer as ""fair"" given the circumstances, Bob aims to pressure Alice into accepting, leveraging the fact that each passing round decreases the value of the money more significantly for her than for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this response, Bob decides to accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, Bob realizes that further negotiations might not yield a substantially better deal. By accepting the 50/50 split, Bob secures a considerable amount, recognizing that the decreasing value of money with each passing round makes the current offer more valuable than potential future offers. This decision also acknowledges the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both players receiving nothing."
