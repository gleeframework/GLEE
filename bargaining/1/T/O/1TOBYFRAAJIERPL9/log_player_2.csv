Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but we need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
