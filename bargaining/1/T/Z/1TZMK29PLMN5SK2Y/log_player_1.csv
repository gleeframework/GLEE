Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a strong starting offer, hoping to get a good share of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty fair, especially considering the inflation.  I'll take it!"
