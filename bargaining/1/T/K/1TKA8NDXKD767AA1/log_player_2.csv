"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully, we can work towards a more even split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice's words sound promising, there's no guarantee of a fairer deal later.  It's better to take a chance on negotiating a better split."
