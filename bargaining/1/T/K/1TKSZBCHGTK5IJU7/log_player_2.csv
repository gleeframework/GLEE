Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's aim for a balanced split. I propose a 60$ for me and 40$ for you. This way, we both get a fair share while accounting for potential future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
