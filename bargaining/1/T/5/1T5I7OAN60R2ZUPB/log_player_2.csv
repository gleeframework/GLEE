Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I acknowledge the inflation, but your offer was too skewed. This is a compromise closer to my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
