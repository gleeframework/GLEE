"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small advantage for me, but still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since I'm getting a smaller share of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't make a deal, so I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that future rounds will bring better opportunities.
