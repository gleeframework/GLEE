Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair. I'm proposing we each take roughly half, with a slight advantage for me to account for the inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
