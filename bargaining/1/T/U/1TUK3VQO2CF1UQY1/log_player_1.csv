Round 4
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's explain why this is a good strategy:

* **Time Pressure:**  As the rounds progress, Bob will feel the pressure of potentially losing everything. This pressure can lead to him making more favorable offers later.
* **Establishing a Pattern:**  By rejecting these early offers, we're signaling to Bob that we're serious about getting a larger share.  We're not simply going to accept the first offer that comes our way.
* **Aiming Higher:** While 450,000 is a significant sum, we're aiming for a better outcome. By continuing to negotiate, we have a chance to secure a larger portion of the money."

{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a strong offer and a chance to finalize a deal. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Rejection:**  Even though the time pressure is increasing, we need to hold firm. Bob's offer is incrementally better, but we're still aiming for a larger share.
* **Leveraging the Remaining Rounds:** We have six rounds left.  By rejecting this offer, we're signaling to Bob that we're willing to risk it all to get a more favorable split. This can make him more willing to concede ground in future rounds. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, but there's still a chance to secure a significantly better outcome if we continue to negotiate strategically."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is of the essence. Let's be realistic and close this deal. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** With only five rounds left, the stakes are high.  This offer reflects that urgency while still aiming for a favorable split. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is our final offer, we're adding weight to our proposal. It signals to Bob that we're serious and won't be swayed easily in the remaining rounds.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's an inherent risk that Bob will reject this, but the potential reward of securing a 75/25 split outweighs settling for a smaller amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm compromising significantly here to avoid us both losing everything. This is my final offer â€“ let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Power:** Bob's tone has changed, and he's now the one offering a ""final"" deal. This indicates a potential shift in his bargaining position.  He might be more willing to concede than he's let on.
* **Significant Improvement:**  This is the best offer Bob has made so far. Accepting guarantees us a substantial amount of money.
* **High Risk of Losing Everything:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. It's crucial to weigh the potential gain against the very real possibility of a complete loss. 

While there's still a slim chance of securing a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, the risk associated with that gamble is significant. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a favorable outcome and avoids the disastrous possibility of both players losing everything."
