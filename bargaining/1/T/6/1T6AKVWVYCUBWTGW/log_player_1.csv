"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more favorable ratio. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}
```"
