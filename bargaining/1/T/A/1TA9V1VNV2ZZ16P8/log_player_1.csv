"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10.  This is a pretty fair offer given the potential for inflation, and I think it gives Bob a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to keep more money, I'm not confident that Bob will be willing to offer me more in the future given the inflation factor. This seems like a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
