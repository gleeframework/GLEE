I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in favor of myself, hoping to get Bob to accept quickly.  Since the money is worth less to him each round, I think it's a good strategy to try to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm going to reject it. Since the inflation is only affecting Bob, I can hold out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer a significant amount to Bob. He's losing value on his share each round, so I think this is a fair offer. I'm hoping he'll accept before the inflation hurts him too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is now starting to get more appealing. Even though my share is less than what I was hoping for, the inflation is starting to hurt Bob significantly.  I think it's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
