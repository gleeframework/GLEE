"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 5500/4500 split is fairer.  It gives you a good share, and since the money is worth less to me each round, it's a good deal for me as well. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
