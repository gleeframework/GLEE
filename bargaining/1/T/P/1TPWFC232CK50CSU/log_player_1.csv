"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll receive $32 (40 x 0.8) if I accept this offer.

I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to get a better offer, so I'll reject this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so it's worth 16% of the original amount. I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 80, it's a fair share considering the decreasing value of money. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you can have 45. I'm willing to compromise a bit to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll receive $5.4 (45 x 0.12) if I accept this offer.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this is a relatively good offer. I'll accept it.
