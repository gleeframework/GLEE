"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, which I believe is fair considering the inflation rates. I'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still favorable given the inflation rates. It's better to secure a decent gain now than risk getting a worse deal later."
