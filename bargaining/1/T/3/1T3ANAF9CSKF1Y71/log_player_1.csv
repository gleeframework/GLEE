"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the $10,000 with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This offers a fair balance considering the risk and potential future value loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I should get a bit more considering the potential risk of inflation. Let's split it 3:2 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
