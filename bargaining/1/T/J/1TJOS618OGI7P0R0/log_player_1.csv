Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200

This is a tough one! Here's why I made the decision to accept:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more I lose due to inflation. Accepting $4,800 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  He seems unlikely to budge further. 
* **Limited Options:** If I reject this offer, I have to propose something in the next round where the money is worth even less to me. It's highly unlikely I can get Bob to agree to something that benefits me more than his current offer. 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the reality of the situation and the impact of inflation force me to make a pragmatic choice."
