"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to play games, I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you half of the money. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and choosing to proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money is now worth 60% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too optimistic about reaching a fair agreement. I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't think this is the end of the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split in my favor, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
