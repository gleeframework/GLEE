Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but my offer is still better than the last one.  We both lose money each round, so let's make a deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is slightly better, but still heavily favors her. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but it's not yet at a point where I should accept such a low offer. I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and we both lose with each passing round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances and the dwindling value. Let's settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to the end.  I'm sticking with my offer.  It's fair and gives us both a good share.  Let's avoid risking a total loss. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting greedier and sticking to her guns, but that offer is still unacceptable. The effects of inflation are becoming severe, but I'm willing to risk it for a better deal in the next few rounds."

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're running out of time.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid a total loss.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking!""}
