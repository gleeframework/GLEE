"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a good chunk upfront. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a larger share. The 20% decrease in value for me is significant, but I believe there's room for negotiation. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to $400,000 and decreased Alice's share to $600,000, hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to her. Given the inflation rates, I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer still gives you a decent share, considering the inflation hitting you harder. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly more reasonable, I still believe I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 36% less for me than in the first round adds pressure, but I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Time is of the essence, Alice. Given the inflation, I think this offer is more than fair. Let's split the difference and walk away with something before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to $450,000, hoping that Alice will see the urgency in the situation and accept this offer. The fact that the money is worth 36% less for me than in the first round means that every round that passes significantly impacts my potential gain. I'm trying to convey this sense of urgency to Alice, hoping she'll be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  The inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's be sensible and close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The fact that the money is worth 59.04% less for me than in the first round means that any further rounds will severely erode my share. Alice's offer of $380,000 is not ideal, but it's better than risking further losses due to inflation. I'll accept this offer and walk away with something rather than risking getting nothing."
