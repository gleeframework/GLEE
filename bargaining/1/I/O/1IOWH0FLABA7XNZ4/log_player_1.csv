"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

```
# Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
# Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
```

I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
