"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, considering I get a slightly larger share, but it's still a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still get the same amount as in the first round, but Bob's offer is more even now. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
