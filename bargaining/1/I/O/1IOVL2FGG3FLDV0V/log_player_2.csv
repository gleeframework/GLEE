Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. Let's split it in a way that's relatively fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worth it for me. This offer is final, take it or we go another round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I'll reject this offer as well. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice is trying to pressure me with the ""final offer"" statement, but I'm not buying it. I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens in the next round. Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but considering the significant inflation I'm facing, I think this offer is more than fair. Let's meet in the middle and end this game.""}"
