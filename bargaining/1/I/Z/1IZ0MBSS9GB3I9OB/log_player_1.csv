"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and proceed to the next round to make a new proposal. The inflation will reduce the value of the money again, but I hope to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}


I've taken into account the inflation and reduced my initial offer, but still trying to get a slightly better deal than a 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split evenly, considering we're both losing to inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer and split the money evenly. Further negotiations would likely lead to even greater losses, so I'll settle for the 50/50 split."
