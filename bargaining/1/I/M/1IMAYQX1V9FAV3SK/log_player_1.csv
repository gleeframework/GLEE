  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last chance. Take it, or we'll both walk away with nothing.""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'd rather take a small share of the remaining amount than risk getting nothing. Bob is taking a huge risk by offering me nothing, but I'm not going to let pride get in the way of getting some money."
