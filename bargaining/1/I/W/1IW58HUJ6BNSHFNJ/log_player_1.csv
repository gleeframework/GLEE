"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with that much disparity. I'll propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (20% less than the previous round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance the split, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and take a bit less, but still a decent share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but it's a decent compromise given the circumstances.
