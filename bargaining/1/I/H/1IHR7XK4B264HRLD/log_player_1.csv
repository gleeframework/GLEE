"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $9,500 ($10,000 - 5% = $9,500).

I'll calculate the effective gain for both of us:

* My gain: 4000
* Bob's gain: 6000

I'll accept the offer, since it's a better deal for me than if I were to continue playing.
