"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 60-40.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, given that the money is worth less with each passing round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
