"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to be generous or just trying to get the better deal. With the inflation, the numbers are already not as attractive as they seemed in the first round. I'd like to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm adjusting the numbers to reflect the inflation and trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the numbers!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled with the numbers, and I'm starting to think Bob is trying to lowball me. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm adjusting the numbers to reflect the continued inflation and trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
