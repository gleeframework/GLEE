"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging that I am the first proposer and have a slight advantage in this round.  Let's see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a better offer for Bob than the previous round, it still isn't a fair split.  I'll take my chances in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This round, I'm going to flip the script a little bit.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, slightly more in line with Bob's offer.  I think this is a reasonable compromise and a good way to test if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  While the inflation hurts him more, I can't accept losing so much of my share.  It's worth waiting to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to try a different strategy this time.  The inflation is hurting Bob significantly more than me, so I'm offering a 40/60 split in his favor.  This shows that I am willing to negotiate and gives him a really good deal, hopefully enough to entice him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. The inflation is hitting Bob really hard, and he's offering me more than I thought he would at this point.  I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing at all."
