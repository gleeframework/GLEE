"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much!""
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a good tone for the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and Bob's offer is to split the money 50/50, I'll calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain:

Alice's gain in Round 2: 500,000 / (0.8) = 625,000

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
