"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, leaving Bob with only $1. I figure he's likely to accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear Bob is willing to be very generous. Accepting this offer means I get something, and with inflation, it's likely Bob's offer will only become more favorable to him in the future rounds."
