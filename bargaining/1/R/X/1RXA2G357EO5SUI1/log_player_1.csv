"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's speed things up. This offer is much better for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob more:**  Bob's offer might seem ""better"" considering the immediate impact of inflation, but it's heavily skewed in his favor in the long run. 
* **Negotiating power:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fairer deal and am not going to be pressured by his framing of the inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer acknowledges the inflation we're both facing while still being a reasonable compromise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've slightly reduced my initial ask (from 70 to 65) to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the shared challenge:** By mentioning that we're BOTH facing inflation, I'm subtly reminding Bob that he's not the only one losing out as time goes on. 
* **""Reasonable compromise"":**  The wording aims to frame my offer as fair and balanced, encouraging Bob to accept before the inflation further diminishes the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, it's the best you'll get considering the rapid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Here's why:**

* **Calling his bluff:** Bob is trying to pressure me with a ""final offer"" and by emphasizing the rapid inflation. However, he's the one losing significantly more value with each passing round. 
* **Still unfavorable:** Even with the inflation, his offer of 45/55 is not in my best interest. I'm willing to bet he's getting desperate and will make a better offer in the next round. 
* **I hold a strong position:** Time is running out, but Bob needs to agree to a deal more than I do. As long as I don't accept an offer below my minimum acceptable amount (which will be influenced by the inflation), I'm in a good spot to make a counter-offer in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. I'm dropping my ask significantly, taking into account the time pressure.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round Pressure:**  This is the last round, so I need to make an offer enticing enough for Bob to accept. 
* **Significant Concession (But Strategic):** Dropping to a 60/40 split is a big move, but it positions me as making a major compromise.  
* **Emphasize Fairness and Time:**  Framing the offer as ""fair"" and highlighting the ""time pressure"" subtly reminds Bob that he's losing out the most if we don't make a deal now.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Feel ""Victorious"":** While this offer is lower than my previous ones, it still gives Bob a slightly larger share than his last offer. This could be enough to make him feel like he ""won"" something in the negotiation and accept."
