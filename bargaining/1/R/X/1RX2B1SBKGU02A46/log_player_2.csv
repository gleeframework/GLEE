"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you'll get a decent share. This is just the first round, we can always negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll start by rejecting this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'd like to see a more even split, considering the inflation will hit Alice harder in the later rounds."

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our share in later rounds.""}
