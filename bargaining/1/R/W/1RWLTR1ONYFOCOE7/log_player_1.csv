"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed in your favor. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal for Round 3."
