"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  After all, even a small amount is better than nothing if he rejects my offer and the money shrinks in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money after inflation.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting even less in the next round."
