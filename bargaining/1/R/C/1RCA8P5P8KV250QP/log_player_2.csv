I'm offering Alice a fair deal, but I'm going to try to get the bigger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With inflation, my share is worth less. It's better to take a 50/50 split now."
