Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split. This ensures a large share for me while giving Bob a reasonable amount.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation rate makes this a good deal for me. Accepting means I get 100,000, which is worth less than 900,000 originally offered, but still better than nothing if we keep rejecting offers.  Let's end this game!"
