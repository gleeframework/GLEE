"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting the effort each of us has put in so far. Let's end this and move on! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll be getting 40 dollars, but it's worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. However, I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth in real terms.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split, especially considering I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 48-52 is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 48 dollars and leave 52 dollars for Bob, trying to find a middle ground."
