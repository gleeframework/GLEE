"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I figure I can afford to be bold since I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a lot better than nothing, I think I can still do better. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a 70/30 split in my favor.  I'm taking into account the inflation and hoping Bob sees that this is a better deal for him than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money.  With a 48.8% reduction in value, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
