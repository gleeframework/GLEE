"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob $60 and keeping $40 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. And Bob's offer seems fair, giving us both an equal share.

So, I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
