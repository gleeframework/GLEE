"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a very uneven split, giving Bob only $1. I am hoping to make him feel pressured to accept, knowing that if he rejects, he might get nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and playing another round."
