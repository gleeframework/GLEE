"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a simple split. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It seems fair to me and avoids us risking losing everything to inflation.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you want a better deal than my first offer.  However, time is money and it's literally losing value with each round.  I'll meet you in the middle -  $55 for me, and $45 for you.  Let's close this deal and not risk losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nInteresting, Alice is trying to use the inflation to her advantage, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I'll keep pushing for more.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"

I'm willing to make a deal, but I think I deserve a bit more than your last offer. How about I take $58 and you take $42?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal, but we're running out of time. My last offer is $56 for me and $44 for you. It's a small concession on my part, but it's better than letting inflation eat away at our potential gains any further.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAlice is getting a bit desperate, and the inflation is really starting to hurt her potential gains. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's keep playing!"

I'm willing to make a deal, but I think I deserve a bit more than your last offer. How about I take $60 and you take $40? It's still a relatively fair split, considering the circumstances. If we don't agree soon, the inflation will just keep eating away at your share.""}"
