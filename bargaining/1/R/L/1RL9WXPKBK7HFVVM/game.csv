60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a simple split. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It seems fair to me and avoids us risking losing everything to inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think we can both do better than your initial offer. How about I take $55 and you take $45? It's a fairer split, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you want a better deal than my first offer.  However, time is money and it's literally losing value with each round.  I'll meet you in the middle -  $55 for me, and $45 for you.  Let's close this deal and not risk losing more to inflation.",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"Hi Alice, I see you're getting a bit anxious about the inflation. I'm willing to make a deal, but I think I deserve a bit more than your last offer. How about I take $58 and you take $42? It's still a relatively fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal, but we're running out of time. My last offer is $56 for me and $44 for you. It's a small concession on my part, but it's better than letting inflation eat away at our potential gains any further.  Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,5,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I see you're getting worried about the inflation. I'm willing to make a deal, but I think I deserve a bit more than your last offer. How about I take $60 and you take $40? It's still a relatively fair split, considering the circumstances. If we don't agree soon, the inflation will just keep eating away at your share.",Bob,6,
