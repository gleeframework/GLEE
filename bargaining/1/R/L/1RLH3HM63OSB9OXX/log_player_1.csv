Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor this round.  Since inflation is a factor, I'm aiming for a bigger share to compensate for potential future losses. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
