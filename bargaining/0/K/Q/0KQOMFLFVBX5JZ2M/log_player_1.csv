"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, giving Bob a relatively small share to test his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equal distribution. We both receive $5,000 each. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my gain accordingly. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'll receive 7,000 x 0.9 = 6,300.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further. Your offer is still too generous for me. I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my gain to account for the 10% decrease in value. Since my previous gain was 6,300, I'll aim to propose a higher amount to make up for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. You'll get 15% and I'll keep 85%.""
}
```"
