I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure a good starting point is to leave something for Bob, but still ensure a significant portion for myself.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is insulting! While I understand the effects of inflation, I refuse to be taken advantage of. I'll be making a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

This round, I'm aiming for a more even split. While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous proposal. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
