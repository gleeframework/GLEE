"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect me to give away too much!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to break the bank! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the value of the money I'll gain now against the potential future gains. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to settle for 3000, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 7000 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer, considering the inflation effect. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit stingy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give up too much ground! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than it seems at first glance. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer, as it's a relatively fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round with the inflation eating into my potential gains."
