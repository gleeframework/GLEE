Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to factor in.  Let's get this done and avoid losing more value! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
