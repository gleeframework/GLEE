"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and share""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I proposed that I take $60 and Bob takes $40. The message ""Let's be fair and share"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I want to try to reach an agreement as soon as possible to minimize the impact of inflation. By offering Bob a significant portion of the money, I hope to entice him to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about this slightly adjusted split? It's better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less to both of us due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. In the first round, I offered Bob $40, and now he is offering me $45, but the value of the money has decreased. Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob (20% less), I think he may be willing to compromise further to reach an agreement before the money loses even more value. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually acceptable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've increased my share to $57 and decreased Bob's share to $43. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness. Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share (now 20% less for the second time), I believe he may be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer to avoid further losses. By positioning my offer as a middle ground, I'm trying to create a sense of reasonableness and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere.  Let's split the difference from our last offers and end this. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. The offer of $48 is closer to my previous offer of $57, and the difference is not substantial enough to warrant further negotiation. Additionally, the message ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's split the difference from our last offers and end this"" suggests that Bob is willing to meet me halfway and is eager to conclude the game. Given the decreasing value of the money, I think it's wise to accept this offer and end the game before the money loses even more value."
