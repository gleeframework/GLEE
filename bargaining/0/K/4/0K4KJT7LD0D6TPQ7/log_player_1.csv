"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer aims to secure a large share for Alice while leaving a small but still significant amount for Bob. The hope is that Bob will accept this offer, knowing that if he rejects it, he might get less in the future due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
 While Bob's offer is better than the previous round's outcome for me, it's still a significant loss. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. This offer is more balanced than my previous one, but I'm still trying to secure a larger share.  While inflation is hurting me, I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer to avoid a further decrease in his share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the offer from Bob is slightly better than the previous round, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I believe that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, as inflation will continue to decrease my potential gains.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to improve my position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on my earnings, I need to secure a more equitable division to avoid further losses. While this offer is less advantageous than my previous proposals, it's a reasonable compromise that balances my need for a fair share with the risk of continued negotiation."
