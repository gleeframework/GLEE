"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 60/40 split in favor of you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a ""fair"" 60/40 split, but we know the money loses value each round. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, as the value of the money is decreasing each round. Hopefully, we can still find a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to split the money equally, considering the inflation and our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to take more, the inflation is definitely impacting the value of the money.  500,000 is a good amount, and accepting avoids further risk."
