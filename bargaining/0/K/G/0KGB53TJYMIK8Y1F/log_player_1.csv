"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm effectively getting $400,000, which is only 40% of the original amount. I'm not sure I want to accept an offer that gives me such a small share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more now 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing its value quickly!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm running out of options. I'll have to think carefully about whether I can afford to reject this offer.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm effectively getting $300,000, which is only 30% of the original amount. It's a tough decision, but I think I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of my potential gain.
