"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I have an advantage in waiting. I'll reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round""}\n\n###\nI'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round. By offering her 40% of the total amount, I'm still giving her a significant share, but also trying to maximize my own gain. The message is a gentle reminder to Alice of the decreasing value of the money for her, in an attempt to persuade her to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than $4000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 45/55. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is willing to compromise, I still have the upper hand due to the inflation affecting her side. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait and see if I can get an even better deal in the next rounds. Rejecting this offer might prompt Alice to offer an even higher share in the next round, as the value of the money continues to decrease for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, maybe we should settle this soon?""}\n\n###\nI'll increase my share to 65% and decrease Alice's share to 35%. The message is a subtle reminder to Alice that the longer we wait, the less value she'll get from her share. By framing it as a suggestion to settle soon, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and make my offer more appealing. I'm hoping that Alice will realize that accepting this offer is better than risking further devaluation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split it 40/60, Bob. It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is trying to appeal to the fact that we're both losing money, I know that's not entirely true - the money is still worth the same to me. Given that Alice's share is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I believe she'll be more desperate to settle as the rounds go on. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to get an even better deal in the next rounds, as Alice becomes more eager to accept a smaller share rather than risking further devaluation."

Let's end this.""}\n\n###\nI'll increase my share to 70% and decrease Alice's share to 30%. The message is more direct and emphasizes the urgency of the situation, highlighting the fact that Alice's share is rapidly losing value. By creating a sense of scarcity and pressure, I'm hoping to persuade Alice to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of her share. With each passing round, Alice's bargaining power decreases, and I'm trying to capitalize on that."

# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nDespite Alice's emotional appeal, I remain focused on maximizing my gain. With her share now worth 46.86% less than in the first round, I believe she's becoming increasingly desperate. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to push her to accept an even lower share in the next rounds. The fact that the money is still worth the same to me gives me a significant advantage in these negotiations, and I'm trying to exploit that to get the best possible deal."

This is my final 'reasonable' offer.""}\n\n###\nI'll increase my share to 75% and decrease Alice's share to 25%. The message is more aggressive and emphasizes the dire situation Alice is in. By framing this as my ""final 'reasonable' offer,"" I'm trying to create a sense of ultimatum and make Alice believe that this is the best deal she'll get. With her share now worth less than half of its original value, I'm hoping she'll be desperate enough to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."

# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nDespite Alice's attempt to appeal to the idea that we're both losing out, I know that's not true - the money is still worth the same to me. With her share now worth 56.95% less than in the first round, I believe she's extremely desperate. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to push her to accept an even lower share in the next rounds. I'm willing to take the risk of waiting, as the potential reward of getting an even better deal is too enticing to pass up."

This is your last chance to walk away with something.""}\n\n###\nI'll increase my share to 80% and decrease Alice's share to 20%. The message is blunt and emphasizes the dire situation Alice is in. By framing this as her ""last chance"" to walk away with something, I'm trying to create a sense of desperation and make her believe that this is the best deal she'll get. With her share now worth less than half of its original value and only two rounds left, I'm hoping she'll be desperate enough to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing at all."
