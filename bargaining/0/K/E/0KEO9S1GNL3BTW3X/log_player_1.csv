"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to play it out for a few rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being quite bold with this offer. Even though my gains are worth less due to inflation, his offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still keep it relatively high.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that he's losing out on a lot of money by continuing to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm going to keep rejecting for now. Inflation is hurting Bob much more than me, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that I can hold out for at least a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation and will be more willing to accept a deal closer to my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Inflation has hit him much harder than me, and it's clear that we're both losing money with each round. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the future if I play this game again, but I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all."
