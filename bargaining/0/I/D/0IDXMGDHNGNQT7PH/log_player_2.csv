**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage and secure a larger share. While time pressure is increasing, accepting a poor offer just because we're nearing the deadline will leave us with significantly less. I'm betting Alice will become more reasonable in the later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a fair deal, and we need to agree before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and inflation is becoming a serious factor.  This offer is still tilted in my favor, but it's close enough to a 50/50 split that Alice might be convinced. The ""final offer"" language adds pressure without being overly aggressive."
