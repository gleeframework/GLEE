"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to get this over with quickly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 60/40 split seems reasonable.  Accept this and we both get a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my proposed gain of $700,000 is now worth $560,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 60/40 split is indeed reasonable, and I'd rather get a guaranteed $400,000 than risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer.
