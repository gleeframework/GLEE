"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than the previous round, and the inflation makes it even less appealing. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Given the rapid inflation and Bob's previous offer, a 50/50 split seems like the fairest and most stable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his last one, the inflation is seriously impacting the value of my share. I will reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with my 55/45 split in my favor. The inflation is making this game a lot riskier, but I'm confident that I can secure a better outcome than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is making my share worth significantly less, I still believe I can get a better deal.  Bob's offer is going back towards a 60/40 split, which is not acceptable given the current inflation rates.  I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to stick with a 50/50 split. We're both losing money rapidly with the inflation, so a fair split seems like the only logical option at this point.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is increasingly unfavorable, and the inflation is making my share worth less and less. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more and propose a 45/55 split in Bob's favor.  The inflation is making this game increasingly difficult, but I believe we can reach an agreement before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and the inflation is making my share worth less than a third of what it was initially. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

With only two rounds remaining and the inflation drastically reducing the value of our money, I need to be more flexible. I'm offering a 40/60 split in Bob's favor, hoping this will be enough for him to agree. We're both losing a lot of money, and this seems like the best way to get something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision. Bob's offer is very unfavorable, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. However, with only one round left, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to negotiate a better deal. It's better to accept this offer and get something, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
