"Round 1
Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 52-48 split in your favor.  Let's settle this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 58-42. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching up her share, but the rate of inflation is hurting me more than her. It's still beneficial to hold out and try for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is hurting both of us.  This 55-45 split is fair and lets us both walk away with something substantial.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to start making more aggressive offers to entice Alice to settle.  A 55-45 split is still in her favor but gets me closer to an acceptable amount. The message emphasizes the time pressure and the negative impact of inflation on both players."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. 57-43 is my new offer. Let's end this soon. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 430,000 payout now avoids the risk of getting a much worse deal later due to the rapidly increasing inflation.  Waiting any longer could result in a significantly smaller net gain even if I manage to secure a slightly larger percentage.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed money."
