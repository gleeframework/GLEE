Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split it closer to 50/50. This way we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on the game.
Inflation affects Bob's gain, reducing its value by 5% each round, but it does not affect Alice's gain.

### Step 2: Analyze the previous offers and the current state of the game.
In Round 1, Alice offered a 60/40 split, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered a 45/55 split, which Alice rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the decreasing value of the money for Bob and how it can be used as leverage.
Since the value of the money decreases for Bob with each round, Alice can potentially use this to her advantage by making offers that slightly favor Bob less over time.

### Step 4: Formulate a new offer that takes into account the current state of negotiations and the impact of inflation.
Given the previous offers and the impact of inflation, Alice can try to find a middle ground that slightly favors her but still considers Bob's decreasing value perception.

### Step 5: Create the offer in the required JSON format.
Alice decides to offer a split that is closer to 50/50 but still slightly in her favor, considering the negotiations so far and the impact of inflation on Bob's perception of value.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle considering inflation.""}"
