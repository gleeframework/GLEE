"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and I'll take $6000. I've included a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable split. Since this is the first round, the full value of $10,000 is still on the table. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, ending the game with both of us walking away with a good amount of money. However, I'm aware that Bob might try to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the money doesn't lose value for him with each passing round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the initiative. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he's framed it as ""taking the initiative,"" his proposed split of $4000 for me and $6000 for him doesn't seem like a significant concession, especially considering that the value of the money has begun to decrease for me due to inflation. In the first round, I offered him a 40% share, and now he's offering me the same percentage but with money that's worth 5% less to me. I think I can do better than that. It's time to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see how Bob responds to my next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll take $5800, and Bob will get $4200. My message, ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle,"" aims to convey that I'm willing to find a compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation on my share. Since Bob doesn't have to worry about inflation, I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable adjustment and accept the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
