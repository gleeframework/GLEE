I propose to keep $90 and give $10 to Bob.  This is a fairly generous offer, considering I have the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
