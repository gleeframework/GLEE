Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start with a fair split!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 10% cut right away, especially since I don't know if Bob is also experiencing the same inflation. I'll counter with a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a fair share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the inflation, it seems Bob is getting more aggressive. I'll accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
