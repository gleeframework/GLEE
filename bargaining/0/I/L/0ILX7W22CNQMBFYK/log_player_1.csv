"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll think it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not afraid to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 * 0.95 = 380000
Bob gain: 600000 * 0.95 = 570000

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
