"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  It's a good starting point, right?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Consider that the value decreases for you each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much.  Let's meet in the middle with 70/30. It's still a good deal for you, and I'll get something out of it too. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is slightly better, it's crucial to remember that the value decreases for her more rapidly with each round.  By rejecting this offer, I increase the pressure on her to make a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
