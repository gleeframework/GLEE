"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I should be more cautious. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer and the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I should take this offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair deal considering the inflation factor. I'll accept this offer.
