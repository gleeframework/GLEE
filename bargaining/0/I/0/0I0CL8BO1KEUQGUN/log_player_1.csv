Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite unfair.  Let's split things more evenly. I propose we take 5250 each. This ensures a more equitable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
