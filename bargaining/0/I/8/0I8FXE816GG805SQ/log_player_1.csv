"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the $1000 and let's negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
