"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60, you can have the rest. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40 is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation."
