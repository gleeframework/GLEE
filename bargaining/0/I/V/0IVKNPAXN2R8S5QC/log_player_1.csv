"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, I believe this is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept the offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation rates, accepting 50% of the original amount in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if we had split it in the first round according to my proposal. Additionally, the fact that money loses more value for Bob with each round puts pressure on him to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I can use this to my advantage by making him wait, potentially leading to a better offer for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Counteroffer to your even split""}\n\nGiven the increasing pressure of inflation, particularly on Bob's side, I'm making a counteroffer that still leans towards a relatively even split but slightly in my favor. This acknowledges Bob's desire for fairness while also taking into account the strategic advantage I gain from the differing inflation rates. The message is straightforward, indicating that it's a response to his previous offer, and aims to keep the negotiation open and potentially finalize the deal before the value of the money drops further."
