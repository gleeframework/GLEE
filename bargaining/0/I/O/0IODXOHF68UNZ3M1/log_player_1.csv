"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game started, and I'm taking the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a relatively small share of the money, and I'm not sure what the future holds in terms of inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the original amount, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a bigger share. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
