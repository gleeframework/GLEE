This is a tough one! I'm heavily tempted to reject again, but the inflation is killing me. Let's break it down:

**Pros of Accepting:**

* **Something is better than nothing:** If we don't settle soon, we'll both end up with nothing due to the rapidly decreasing value. 
* **Better than previous offers:** 47 is more than Alice's previous offer of 45.

**Cons of Accepting:**

* **Still below my target:** It's significantly less than my initial 60/40 goal.

**Decision:**  The rapidly increasing inflation means time is running out. Accepting 47 now is a safer bet than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds.
