"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split accounts for the time value of money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  I'll take a slight edge considering the time pressure, but this offer still gets us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Reason: Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting longer means getting even less in the end. 
* **Decent Offer:** While not a 50/50 split, getting $45 is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to disagree.
* **Negotiating Position:**  Alice knows the clock is ticking, and her offers might get less favorable as we get closer to the deadline.  Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
