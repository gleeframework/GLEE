"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I propose an 85/15 split in my favor.  While I had to reduce my initial offer due to inflation, I believe this still reflects a fair division considering the potential for further inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to take the $10, the offer is rapidly becoming less appealing due to inflation.  I'm holding out for a better split, hoping Bob recognizes that we're both losing money with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to further compromise to avoid ending up with nothing, I believe this offer still reflects a fairer division, considering the significant inflation that has occurred."
