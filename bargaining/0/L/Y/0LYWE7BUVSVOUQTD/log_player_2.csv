Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since Alice is willing to start with an equal split, I'll try to take a larger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 in this round is equivalent to about 2800 in the first round. I'm still a bit short of my goal from round 2, but I'll consider Alice's offer.
