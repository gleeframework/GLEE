"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still not happy with a 20% share. I'll see what I can get in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'll offer Bob 40% this time, hoping to get a deal done. Inflation is a concern, but I'm still aiming for a larger share."

# Bob gain: 750000

I'm still not happy with this offer. While inflation is a factor, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

With inflation hitting hard, I'm trying to secure a decent share while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm offering Bob 60% this time, which should be appealing considering the dwindling value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has hit me hard, and this is the best offer I'm likely to get.  While it's a far cry from my initial goal, I'll take the 100,000."
