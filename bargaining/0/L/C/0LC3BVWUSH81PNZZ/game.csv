5400.0,4600.0,"Okay, Bob, I see your point about fairness. Let's try a 54/46 split in my favor. It's still a bit in my favor, but it reflects the inflation we're both facing. I hope this is a good compromise.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of this money is slipping away with each round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I'm facing while still offering you a substantial sum. Let's close this deal now.",Bob,4,
