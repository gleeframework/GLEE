Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting Alice, but let's be efficient. I value our time, so I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me.  Take it now, and we both win big before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
