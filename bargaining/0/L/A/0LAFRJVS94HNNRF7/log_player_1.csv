Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split in round 2 is the logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Waiting any longer significantly reduces the value of the money.
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is reasonable and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees I receive something, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of getting nothing at all."
