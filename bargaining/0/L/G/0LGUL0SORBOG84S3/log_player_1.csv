I'm going to try to get most of the money in the first round. I'll offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in that easily. I'll reject his offer and make my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share. With each round, the value of the money decreases, and I need to secure a significant portion before it's too late."
