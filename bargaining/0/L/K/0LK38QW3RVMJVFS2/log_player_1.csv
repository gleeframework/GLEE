I'm proposing a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob. I'm going for a big chunk, but I want to leave some room for negotiation in case Bob is not happy with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While my gain is less than my initial offer, it's still a significant amount, and the inflation factor makes it even more important to secure this deal.  Waiting for another round could lead to further devaluation of my potential gains."
