"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my thinking. The 50/50 split might not be as appealing as it was initially.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, but I think I deserve more considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll take 70.""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking 70 dollars and leaving Bob with 30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 35 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the offer, I think 65 is a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less and less, I'll take the offer this time. Maybe I can negotiate more in the next rounds.
