"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Take this reasonable offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a ""reasonable"" offer to try to get Bob to accept quickly."
