"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. But Bob's offer is a good starting point. I'll accept the offer, but I'll make a slight adjustment.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
