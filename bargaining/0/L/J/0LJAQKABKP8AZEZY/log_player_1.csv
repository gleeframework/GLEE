"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 6,000 and Bob will take 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll still have to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel like I'm giving up too much. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer seems too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's try for a 45-55 split!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I'll take 4,500 and Bob will take 5,500. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50-50 split, but still gives me a bit more."
