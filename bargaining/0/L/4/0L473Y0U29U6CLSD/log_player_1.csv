"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 1/4, I'll take the rest 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start for me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's true that I'd get 1/4 of the money, which is $250,000, I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a large share of the pie. He's offering me a relatively small amount compared to what he's keeping for himself.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40%, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still offering Bob a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small bonus, but I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great offer from Bob!

While I appreciate the ""bonus"" of $100,000, it's still a tiny fraction of the total amount. Giving Bob 90% of the money is not a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30%, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offers""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly better deal, taking into account that I've rejected two of Bob's previous offers. I'm willing to give him 30% of the money, but I think I deserve a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 1/5, I'll take the rest, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great offer from Bob again!

I'm not thrilled about getting only 1/5 of the money, which is $200,000. It's a relatively small share, and I'm not convinced that it's a ""fair deal"" for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20%, but I think I deserve a much larger share after rejecting your previous offers""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a better deal, taking into account that I've rejected three of Bob's previous offers. I'm willing to give him 20% of the money, but I think I deserve a much larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the lion's share 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is unacceptable!

Getting only $50,000 is an insult, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share of the money. It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of me now that I've rejected a few of his previous offers.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, I'll take 90% of the money, you can have 10%""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, trying to take the majority of the money for myself. I'm not going to accept any more of Bob's lowball offers, and I'm confident that I deserve a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take almost all the money 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is outrageous!

Getting only $10,000 is an insult, and I'm not going to accept such a tiny share of the money. It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of my previous offers and squeeze me for all he can.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to give up yet!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 5%, but I'm not going to give up on getting a fair share""
}
```

I'm making a final push for a better deal, trying to get as much as I can. I'm willing to give Bob a small share, but I'm not going to let him take the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, take the $1000 or leave it 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is it, the final round!

Getting only $1,000 is a ridiculously low offer, and I'm not going to accept it. I've come too far and negotiated too hard to settle for such a tiny share of the money.

I'll reject this offer and stick to my guns. It's time for Bob to make a serious offer or walk away with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we've reached the end of the 12 rounds. I'm not getting any more offers, so I'll just have to accept the fact that we're going to walk away with nothing. Better luck next time!"
