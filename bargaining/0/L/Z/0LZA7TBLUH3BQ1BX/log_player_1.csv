"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 (still worth the same as before)
* Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.9 = $3,600 (10% less than the original $4,000)

Now, Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which is a better deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
