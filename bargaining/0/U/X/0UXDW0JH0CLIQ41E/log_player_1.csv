"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives me a decent buffer against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more balanced split. This offer gives you a good starting point while still allowing for future negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more substantial starting point, and this offer is too skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair, but still gives me a slight edge due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The inflation is taking a big toll on my potential gains, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up some more to get closer to a fair split. Let's try again""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%. I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the inflation and gives us both a decent share of the remaining money."
