"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer. His gain is still too large, and I'd like to propose a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed in your favor. I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $9,000 in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for more, I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, it's equivalent to $7,310.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as his gain is still too large.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed in your favor. I'm not willing to give up that much.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, it's equivalent to $7,310.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to be reasonable about my own gain.""
}
```"
