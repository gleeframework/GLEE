# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both being stubborn. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's time to stop being greedy and accept the offer. With the inflation, Alice is losing a lot of value, and it's unlikely she'll make a better offer. Splitting it evenly seems like a fair deal at this point."
