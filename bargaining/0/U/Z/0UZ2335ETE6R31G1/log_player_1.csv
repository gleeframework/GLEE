"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous share, but I'm keeping the majority of the $100 to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $24.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering I'm getting a smaller share than I did in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm also taking a smaller share to account for the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate my gain in Round 4. Since my gain in Round 1 was $60, and the money I gain in Round 4 is worth 48.8% less, my gain would be:

$60 * (1 - 0.488) = $60 * 0.512 = $30.72

Since Bob's offer is for me to gain $20, which is less than my calculated gain, I'll accept this offer.
