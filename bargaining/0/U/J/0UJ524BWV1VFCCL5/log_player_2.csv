"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I know Alice's perceived value of the money decreases faster than mine. It's in my best interest to wait for a better offer from her as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""It's my turn, Alice.  How about a slightly better deal for me this time?""}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm pushing for a slightly better split, knowing that Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value.  I'm not being too greedy yet, as I don't want to scare her into a protracted negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it a little closer to your offer, but I need to get at least 47 to make it worthwhile for me with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and has moved closer to my desired split. While I could potentially squeeze out a tiny bit more in later rounds, there's a risk she becomes too desperate and offers a deal that's very bad for me. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent gain and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
