"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that is highly in my favor, but I recognize that Bob might be more willing to negotiate in later rounds when the money is worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this offer more appealing than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
