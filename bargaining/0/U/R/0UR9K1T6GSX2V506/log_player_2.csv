"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer seems generous, it's too risky to accept in the first round.  The inflation will quickly eat away at the value of my single dollar. I need to see if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split, 900,000 for me and 100,000 for you. Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money fairly this time, Bob.  I'll take 900000 and you can have 100000. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation rate is already high, and rejecting this offer could result in even less for me in the next round. It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
