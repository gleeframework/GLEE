"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This way, we can both get a decent amount and have room to negotiate in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking 80% of the remaining $1,000,000. I'll have to think carefully.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the remaining amount fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 45%. I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards his favor, taking 70% of the remaining $1,000,000. However, I'll consider it carefully.

After thinking about it, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only 30% of the remaining amount. I'd like to keep negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining amount evenly. It's time to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with the same amount. I'm hoping this more balanced split will be more appealing to him."
