"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10 to start, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, but I'm also giving him a chance to reassess the situation in the next round."
