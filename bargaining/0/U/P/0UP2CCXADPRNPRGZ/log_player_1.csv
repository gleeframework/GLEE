"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split. This is a good starting point for us both to consider, and it's better than getting nothing at all with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
