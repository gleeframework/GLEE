"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with the message ""Let's divide fairly."" This division seems reasonable, as I get a slightly larger share for making the first offer, but Bob still receives a substantial amount. The message aims to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I would actually receive less value than in the first round. With each passing round, the money's value decreases, and I aim to maximize my gain. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust."" This division takes into account the decreased value of money due to inflation and still presents a relatively fair offer. By acknowledging the impact of inflation, I'm attempting to create a sense of mutual understanding and encourage Bob to accept the offer, ending the game before the money's value decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to account for inflation, but let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message suggests a willingness to compromise and account for inflation, the actual offer doesn't quite live up to that promise. With the money's value decreasing significantly due to inflation, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss of value compared to the initial rounds. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation affects us both, but I'll take a smaller hit.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4400 and keep $5600 for myself, with the message ""Inflation affects us both, but I'll take a smaller hit."" This division acknowledges that inflation impacts both of us, but also recognizes that I'm affected less than Bob. By framing the offer in this way, I'm attempting to create a sense of mutual understanding and shared sacrifice, while still securing a relatively favorable deal. The message aims to convey a sense of compromise and cooperation, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's find a deal that works for both of us, even with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although his message suggests a desire to find a mutually beneficial deal, the actual offer doesn't quite meet my expectations. With the significant impact of inflation on the money's value, I'm looking for a more favorable division. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss of value compared to the initial rounds. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a better deal. As the game progresses, the pressure to reach an agreement increases, and I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4600 and keep $5400 for myself, with the message ""Time is running out, let's settle."" This division is slightly more favorable to me than the previous offers, but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on the money's value. The message aims to create a sense of urgency, emphasizing that time is running out and we need to reach an agreement soon. By framing the offer in this way, I'm attempting to encourage Bob to accept the deal and end the game, rather than risking further losses due to inflation."
