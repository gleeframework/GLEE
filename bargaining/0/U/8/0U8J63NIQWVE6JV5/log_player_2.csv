"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can work out a better deal later if we need to. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI want more than 40 dollars. Let's see what happens in the next round. Maybe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so a 50/50 split seems like the most sensible way to go. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nA 50/50 split seems fair, and with inflation, it's better to take the offer now rather than risking further loss of value."
