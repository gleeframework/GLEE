"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20. I'm framing it as a fair split, but it's really a strong opening bid to see if Bob will accept or counter."
