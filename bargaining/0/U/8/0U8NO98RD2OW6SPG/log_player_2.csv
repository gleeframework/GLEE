"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a larger share this time, but you'll get a chance to negotiate in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds somewhat reasonable, the devaluation of the money over time means I should aim for a more significant share in the earlier rounds.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""My turn! This offer accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a decent share.  Let's close the deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so we should aim for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right.  While this isn't the best deal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  It's better to accept a safe deal now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
