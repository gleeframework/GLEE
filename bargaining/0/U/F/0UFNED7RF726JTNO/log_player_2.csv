"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round after the value of her share drops by 20%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split.  Let's be fair but also keep in mind the decreasing value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise given the inflation factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, while rejecting it risks ending up with nothing."
