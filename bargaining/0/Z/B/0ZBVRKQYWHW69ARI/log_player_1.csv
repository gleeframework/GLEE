I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'll take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is significantly less than in the first round, it's still better than what I'd get if I reject and the game continues. The inflation is a factor, and I'm not sure how it'll continue to affect the future rounds. It's better to accept this offer and secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
