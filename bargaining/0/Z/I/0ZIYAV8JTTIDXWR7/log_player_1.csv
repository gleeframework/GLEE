"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the less but you'll get a smaller share later""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take a smaller share now, hoping that the inflation will make Bob's share smaller in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 50/50 split is a bit too even for me, and I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less valuable money, so I'll give you a slightly bigger share now""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less value, I'll give you a slightly smaller share now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still a bit better for him, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll decide to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
