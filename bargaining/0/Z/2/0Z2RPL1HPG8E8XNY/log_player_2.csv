Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about a 65/35 split? This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid any further potential losses due to inflation.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
