I need to hold firm.  While this deal is getting closer to something acceptable as time goes on, it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor due to the inflation working against me."

This is getting frustrating! Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I can't accept such a low offer, even with the time pressure. I need to remain firm and hope he starts negotiating more realistically soon."
