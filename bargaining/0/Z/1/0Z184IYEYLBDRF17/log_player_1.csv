Let's see if Bob is happy with a generous 90/10 split!  üòÅ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting less in the future with inflation."
