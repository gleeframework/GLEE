**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my end. While this offer is closer to a reasonable split, waiting her out will force her to offer even better terms as her potential gains are shrinking faster.  I'm willing to gamble a bit more to secure a larger portion of the money."
