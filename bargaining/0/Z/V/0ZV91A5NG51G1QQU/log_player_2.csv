"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This leaves you with a decent share and avoids us risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I think a 60/40 split is too lopsided in Alice's favor. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer. Let's avoid further inflation and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is more than generous considering the inflation. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still not happy with a 55/45 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split the money evenly and avoid further losses.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""}
