"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1
I'll start by offering a division that seems reasonably fair but slightly in my favor, as is common in negotiation tactics. I'll also include a message to Bob to frame my offer in a positive light.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, slightly adjusted for my brilliant negotiation skills.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your negotiation skills are impressive, but let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2
Since Bob is offering a perfectly fair 50/50 split, it would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure we both get a significant amount of money without risking the potential of getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
