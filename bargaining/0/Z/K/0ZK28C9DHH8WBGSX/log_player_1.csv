"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable division based on the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer. 
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not convinced yet!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm still looking for a better deal. The value of the money is decreasing, but I'm not ready to settle for this yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 10% decrease from the previous round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
