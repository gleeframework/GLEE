"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively equal split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
