"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth seeing if Alice will offer more, especially considering the potential inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split.  Accept this and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This way, we both get a decent share. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's still less than I offered, the inflation is a factor. Taking 450,000 is better than risking another round and getting even less due to the increasing inflation."
