**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for me.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer, even though the pressure is on. There's a chance she'll panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a much larger sum to avoid getting nothing."

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and while this isn't ideal, it's significantly better than Alice's previous offers. The risk of walking away with nothing is getting very high. It's time to secure a reasonable amount rather than gambling on a desperate last-minute offer from Alice."
