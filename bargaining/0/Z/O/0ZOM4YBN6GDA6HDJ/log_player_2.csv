Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer: 60/40 split. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better outcome, but I can't accept a 55/45 split. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? This way, we both get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking very close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  While her offer isn't terrible, I think I can still negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with every round that passes. This offer is a 51/49 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time constraint and the fact that we began with a 60/40 split. Let's close this deal and walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, Alice is right about the time constraint and the shrinking pot. This offer is reasonably close to my target, and accepting now guarantees a decent payout. Holding out for a better deal carries increasing risk with diminishing returns."
