Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the inflation effect. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's offer is 4000, it's equivalent to 4500 in the first round, which is a decent amount.

However, considering the inflation effect, I'd like to try to negotiate for more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
