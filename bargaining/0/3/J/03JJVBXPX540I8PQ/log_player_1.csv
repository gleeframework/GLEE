```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7-3 to get started""

I'm proposing a 7,000$ to 3,000$ split, which is a fair starting point."

# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and start with a clean slate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best deal for me. I'd like to think I can do better.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is reducing the value of the money, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll aim for a more aggressive split to make up for the lost value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, considering the inflation""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll have to be extremely cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 2000$, but I don't see a better opportunity arising. I'll have to accept this offer to avoid further losses.
