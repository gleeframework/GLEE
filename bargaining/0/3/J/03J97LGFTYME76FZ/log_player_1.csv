"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a fair starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's offer is 50% for both of us, that means I'll get $50, which is 50% of $100. But considering the 5% inflation, the actual value of $50 is now worth 95% of its original value. So, I'll get $47.50 in actual value.

I'll accept this offer.
