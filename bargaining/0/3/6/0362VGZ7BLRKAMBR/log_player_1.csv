Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. We can negotiate further if you're not happy with it.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
