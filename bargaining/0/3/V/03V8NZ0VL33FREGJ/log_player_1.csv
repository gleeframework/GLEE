"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time around.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
