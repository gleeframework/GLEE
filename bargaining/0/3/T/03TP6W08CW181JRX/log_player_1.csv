"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal, keeping 95% for myself and giving Bob 5%.  I figure this will make him want to counter-propose, and we can negotiate from there.  It's also a good starting point to see how he reacts to the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep a larger portion of the money, it's important to consider inflation. My share will be worth less in each subsequent round, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
