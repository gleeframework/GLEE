"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share, but it's important to secure Bob's acceptance.  We'll see if he's willing to take a smaller share in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous offer, and even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a majority share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continued rejection might lead to a worse outcome for him as the inflation continues to affect his share more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money for both of us.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a decent amount, especially considering Bob's share is worth much less now due to inflation."
