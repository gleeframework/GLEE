"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. A 50/50 split after inflation is effectively a loss for whoever goes second. Let's end this now and both come out winners. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
