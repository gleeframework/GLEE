Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after one round, the total amount left is 10,000 * 0.9 = 9,000$

I'll make a proposal to divide the remaining 9,000$

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, the total amount left is 9,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 7,650$

Alice's offer is 4500 + 7,650 = 8,150$

Since I gain 4500$, which is 4500 / 7,650 = 0.588 of the total, I'll accept this offer.
