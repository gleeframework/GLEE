Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's speed things up. I'm lowering my initial offer slightly. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly increasing the pressure and making smaller concessions. However, the offers are still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she'll offer a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This offer is a fair compromise and ensures we both benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. It's a significant amount and avoids us both leaving with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this is the best offer Bob is likely to get at this stage. Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and with time running out, rejecting it carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all. It's better to secure a reasonable sum now than gamble on a better outcome with only 5 rounds remaining."
