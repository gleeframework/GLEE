Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take $55, you get $45. It's fair considering the inflation hits you harder

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to hold firm to maximize my potential gain. Accepting anything less than $50 after this round means I am losing money compared to just splitting it evenly.  Bob is clearly using a delaying tactic."
