"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of money decreases by 10% for me each round, I'll start by offering a division that slightly favors me. This way, I have room for negotiation in subsequent rounds while still being somewhat fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit greedy Alice! How about a more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, 450,000 in the second round is worth less than it would have been in the first round. I initially offered a split that slightly favored me, and Bob's counteroffer not only reduces my share but also doesn't account for the loss in value due to inflation from my perspective. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll adjust my offer to be closer to Bob's last proposal but still take into account the inflation affecting my share. Since the value of money decreases by 10% for me each round, what was worth $600,000 in the first round is now worth less. However, I will offer a division that shows compromise while considering the devaluation of my share.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the last offer, I'll meet you closer to the middle, but remember, each round costs me more than you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real, this back and forth is pointless. I'm offering a perfectly even split. Take it or let's both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on my potential earnings, an even split where I receive $500,000 is actually a more favorable deal for me now than it would have been in the first round due to the decreasing value of money. Since Bob's offer does not account for the inflation from my perspective, and we're at a point where further negotiations might lead to a significant decrease in the value of any potential gain for me, accepting this offer seems like the most rational choice to ensure I walk away with something substantial.
