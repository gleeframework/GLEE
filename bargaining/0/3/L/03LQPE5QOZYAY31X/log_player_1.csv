Inflation is really hurting now, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm hoping he sees that this is a good compromise considering the amount of money I'm losing due to inflation."

Inflation has eaten away at my share significantly, and I'm worried I'll get nothing if I reject this offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I need to accept this to ensure I get something."
