Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. We both deserve a significant share. This offer ensures a more balanced split.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation further diminishes the value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, Bob's share is decreasing significantly with each round due to inflation. I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more amenable to a larger share for me in later rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally starting to feel the heat of the inflation, but he still seems to overestimate his bargaining power.  I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, as he's likely to get desperate in the next couple of rounds."

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is really on Bob now, as his potential gains are dropping quickly. My offer in round 7 was actually quite fair, so I'm going to hold firm and see if he'll crack under pressure.  I'm aiming for at least a 60/40 split in my favor."
