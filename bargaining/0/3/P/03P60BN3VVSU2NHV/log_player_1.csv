"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4:6 is a fairer ratio, considering the risk of inflation is still uncertain. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
