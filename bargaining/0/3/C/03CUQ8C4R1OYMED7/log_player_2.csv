"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's proposal is very unfair, even with inflation, I can likely get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This is a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60% is too much. Let's split it 70/30. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 70/30 is better than 90/10, I still think I can get a better deal later on.  I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 65% for you, but I need to get a better deal than the 30% offered in the last round. This is a fair compromise given the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my 60% offer.  We need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is much better than the 30% I was offered in the previous round. While it's still not ideal, I'm worried about further inflation eroding my share, so I'll take it."
