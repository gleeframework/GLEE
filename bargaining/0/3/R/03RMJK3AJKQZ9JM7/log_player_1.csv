I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split in round 2 is a good deal given the inflation factor.  It's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
