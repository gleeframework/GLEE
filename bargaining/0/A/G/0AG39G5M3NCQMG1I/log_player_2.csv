"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I think I can get a better deal than that. I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that the value of the money will decrease for you in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but 60/40 is too much. Let's settle for 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still think I could get a better deal, the value of money for Alice is dropping fast, and the risk of getting nothing at all is rising. 55/45 is a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk it further."
