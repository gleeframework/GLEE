"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a bigger share already!

I'll think about it... Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: $4000 (worth the same as in Round 1)
* Bob's gain: $4800 (20% less than his original offer of $6000)

I'm not sure if I want to give up $800 more to Bob, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject his offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm still willing to compromise. I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot!

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* My gain: $4500 (worth the same as in Round 1)
* Bob's gain: $2800 (48.8% less than his original offer of $5500 in Round 2)

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'll accept his offer.
