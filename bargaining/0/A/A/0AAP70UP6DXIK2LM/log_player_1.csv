"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time for a more equitable split.  Let's both get a little more than what you offered last time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

* My gain: 40 / 0.9 = 44.44 (since I lose 10% of the value)
* Bob's gain: 60 / 0.8 = 75 (since Bob loses 20% of the value)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to be more aggressive this time to make up for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time. I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
