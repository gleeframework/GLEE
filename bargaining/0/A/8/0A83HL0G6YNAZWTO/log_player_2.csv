"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is fairer considering the decreasing value.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** While Alice's offer was tempting, it heavily favored her. Accepting a less favorable offer early is better than risking a worse outcome later due to inflation.
* **Inflation:**  The money loses value each round. My offer reflects this, aiming for a more equitable split considering the diminishing returns.
* **Strategy:** This offer signals a willingness to negotiate but also demonstrates that I'm aware of the game's dynamics and won't accept an unfair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases rapidly for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  This is Round 3, meaning the value of the money has decreased significantly. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for me.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message implies she won't budge further.  Rejecting this offer likely means getting an even smaller share in a future round, if any. 
* **Minimal Gains:** While not ideal, the difference between this offer and my previous one is relatively small considering the inflation. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing more value."
