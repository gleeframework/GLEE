Let's see how Bob reacts to this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, hoping he'll realize it's better to take this than risk the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, the inflation is making the money less valuable with every round. It's better to take this offer and secure at least some money than to risk getting nothing."
