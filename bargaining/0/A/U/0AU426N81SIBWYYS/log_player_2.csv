"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but we can adjust later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth seeing what kind of offers Alice might make in the future.  I'm hoping to get a better deal later on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share since my money is losing value faster. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's not the best split, it's better than getting nothing, especially given that each round the money is worth less.  It's better to secure a decent amount now."
