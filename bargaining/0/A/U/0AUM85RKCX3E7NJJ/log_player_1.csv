""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good deal for you before the money loses even more value.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and aim for a split that benefits us both before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is significantly worse than Alice's previous offer, it's important to consider the rapid devaluation of the money for Bob. 

* **Bob's perspective:** The longer the game goes on, the less appealing even a larger share becomes. Accepting 60 now is better than risking a much smaller amount later.
* **Alice's perspective:**  Bob's desperation is increasing, making it less likely he'll offer anything better in future rounds. Accepting 40 now guarantees a decent amount rather than risking a much lower payoff later.

This is a classic example of how time pressure and asymmetric information can drastically impact negotiation outcomes."
