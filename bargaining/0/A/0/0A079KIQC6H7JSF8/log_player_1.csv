I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This allows for a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll lower my initial demand to 55/45 in my favor.  This acknowledges Bob's increased leverage due to inflation, but still gives me a fair share."
