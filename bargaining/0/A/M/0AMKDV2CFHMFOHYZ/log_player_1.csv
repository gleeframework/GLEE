"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, I'll have to be even more strategic. Since Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, I'll try to negotiate further. However, considering the reduced value of money, I'll accept this offer.
