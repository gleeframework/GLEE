"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% now, and we can reassess later""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, and I'm framing it as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 80, I'm matching your initial offer, let's see if you'll accept this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the effective amount I'd gain is $70 (80 * 0.9).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is matching my initial offer, I'm not getting a better deal than before, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount is $63 (70 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want to keep a slight majority""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me 40, I'm offering you a slight increase, will you accept now? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the effective amount is $73.08 (80 * 0.9074).

I'm considering Bob's new offer. He's offering me a slight increase from my previous offer, but he's still getting the majority of the money.
