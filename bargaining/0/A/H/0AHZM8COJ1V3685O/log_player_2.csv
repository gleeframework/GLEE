Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're both feeling the pressure of inflation. Let's stop wasting time and split the money evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
