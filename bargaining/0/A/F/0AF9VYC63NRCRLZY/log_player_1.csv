"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $700,000 and Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the offer.

My gain of $500,000 is actually worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 remains the same.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the ongoing inflation, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation.

My gain of $400,000 is worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $291,600. Bob's gain of $600,000 remains the same.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
