Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fair offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is better than nothing.  I'd rather secure 60% of the value, even with the inflation, than risk losing it all by rejecting and having to make a counter-offer."
