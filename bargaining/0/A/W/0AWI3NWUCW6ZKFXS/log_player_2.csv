"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the offer is worse than Alice's initial proposal,  inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.
* **Potential for Further Losses:**  Rejecting this offer means going to another round, where the value of the money will continue to decrease. It's more likely that Alice will propose an even lower amount for Bob in the next round. 

**It's a gamble, but accepting the offer is the safer play to secure some money before it depreciates further.**"
