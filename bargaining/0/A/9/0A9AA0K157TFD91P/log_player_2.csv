Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Pressure:**  With 7 rounds remaining and the value of the money decreasing significantly, the risk of walking away with nothing increases substantially.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round makes the potential gains significantly smaller due to inflation. Waiting for a slightly better offer might not be worth the loss in overall value. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. Her offer, while still favoring her, shows she is willing to compromise to a degree.

Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum, even with the impact of inflation."
