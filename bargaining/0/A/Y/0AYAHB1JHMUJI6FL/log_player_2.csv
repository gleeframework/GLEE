"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid the risk of inflation. This offer gives us a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 10% inflation for me and only 5% for Alice, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation difference. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I still think I can get a better deal, and Alice's ""final offer"" might be a bluff. With the increasing inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and make another counteroffer in the next round. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing inflation. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation difference.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're losing money every round. My offer is still on the table. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
### 
Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference between our gains is still noticeable, but the risk of further inflation and potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds is too great. I'll take the 4000, which is still a decent amount, and conclude the game."
