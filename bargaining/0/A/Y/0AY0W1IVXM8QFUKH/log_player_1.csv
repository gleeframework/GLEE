"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping the message ""Let's be reasonable"" will encourage him to accept this offer and end the game here. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob with each passing round, I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for the potential future devaluation for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Bob's eagerness to ""wrap this up"" suggests he might be willing to compromise further to avoid additional rounds where his potential gain decreases in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\nGiven that the money loses value for Bob with each round but remains the same for me, I'm increasing my proposed share to $650,000. The message ""Consider the inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that the longer we negotiate, the less his share is worth, which might prompt him to accept this offer rather than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob presents a 50/50 split as the fairest option, I must consider the effect of inflation on his share. Since his money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, a 50/50 split is not as equitable as it initially seems. Given this, I believe I can push for a better deal, so I'm rejecting his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for Bob's share due to inflation (now 27.1% less than the initial value), I'm increasing my proposed share to $700,000. The message ""Inflation is taking its toll"" serves as a reminder to Bob of the continuous devaluation of his potential gain, aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer is more beneficial than proceeding to another round where his share would decrease further in value."
