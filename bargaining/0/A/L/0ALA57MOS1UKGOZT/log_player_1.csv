Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split, favoring myself. I figure Bob might accept, as he's losing a lot more value each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting a lot less than I initially wanted, I'm losing 5% each round. I'd rather take the 300,000 now than risk getting nothing later on."
