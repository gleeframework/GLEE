Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about we split things a bit more evenly this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I understand you want a more even split, but I need to account for the inflation. This offer is my bottom line.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now before we both lose out more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely impacting my returns with each passing round. Accepting now cuts my losses.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might force Bob to offer slightly more favorable splits, but the gains would be minimal compared to the increasing losses from inflation.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might dig in his heels, leading to a worse outcome for me later."
