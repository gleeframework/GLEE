"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60 for me, 40 for you.  Sounds good? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, Alice's 60 will be worth less in the next round, so I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, 55 for me, 45 for you is a fairer deal.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Alice with each passing round, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 58, you take 42. It's a better deal for both of us than the last round, considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the offer seems slightly better than the previous one, I'll reject it because the money is still worth less for Alice than for me. I'm hoping that in the next round, Alice will be more desperate to make a deal and I can get an even better offer. Plus, since the money is worth less for her, she might be more willing to compromise.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The money's value is dropping fast for you, 60 for me, 40 for you is the best deal you'll get.""}\n\n###\nI'm making an even more aggressive offer, considering the money's value is decreasing rapidly for Alice. I'm hoping she'll feel the pressure and accept this deal, which is still relatively better for her than the previous offers, given the inflation rate.\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is getting crazy. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day. It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split is a relatively good deal for me at this point. The money's value is decreasing for both of us, but more significantly for Alice. I think it's time to accept this offer and end the game before the inflation gets even worse."
