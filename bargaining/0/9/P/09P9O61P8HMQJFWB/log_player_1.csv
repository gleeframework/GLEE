Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  I'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I might not be able to get a better offer in the future, especially considering inflation. It's better to secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing."
