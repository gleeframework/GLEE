**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic and refusing to offer anything remotely fair.  

* **Bob is getting desperate:**  Each round, the deal gets significantly worse for Bob. He's starting to panic, realizing he needs to salvage something.
* **Accepting the inevitable:** By round 6, Bob is likely realizing that Alice will never offer him anything above 50%, and even that is unlikely. He's better off cutting his losses and accepting a bad deal than risking getting a much worse one in later rounds.

This offer is a last-ditch attempt to get something decent. It's likely still a losing proposition, but the alternative is likely even worse."
