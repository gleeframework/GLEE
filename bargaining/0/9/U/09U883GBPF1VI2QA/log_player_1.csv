"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 3:1. I'll take the smaller share, you can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm making a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal and will help us both get the most money possible before inflation starts to bite. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
