I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Although I'm getting a bit less, Bob is still getting more than what he'd get if we split the money equally. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400}
```

I'm going to try to get a little closer to an even split, but still keep the offer slightly in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
