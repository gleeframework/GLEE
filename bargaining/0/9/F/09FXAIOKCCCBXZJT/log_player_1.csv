"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, and I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially since Bob gets the larger share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the initial offer I made. Let's try 45-55, and we can call it a day!""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, but still being reasonable. I think 45-55 is a fair split, considering the initial offer I made and the fact that Bob is trying to take a larger share."
