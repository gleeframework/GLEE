Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and flip the script! Let's see if Alice is willing to accept a slightly more favorable deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, the inflation is starting to hurt, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome. I'll take it!"
