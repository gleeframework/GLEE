"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my potential gain of $40 is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll think carefully... and decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up with us! Considering my potential gain of $20 is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

I'll think carefully... and decide to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
