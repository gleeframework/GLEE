"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split to minimize risk.  I'll take $6000, and you get $4000. This way, we both get a good share, and we'll avoid the increasing risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
