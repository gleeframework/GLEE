  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

My gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $475,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get a better deal than this.

Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, and there have been 3 rounds so far, the total decrease is 5% * 3 = 15%. However, I also need to consider the initial 5% decrease, so the total decrease is 15% + 5% = 20%.
