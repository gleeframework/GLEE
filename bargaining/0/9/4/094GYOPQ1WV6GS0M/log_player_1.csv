"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 55:45 split.  While I understand the value of the money decreases each round, I think this offer is more equitable.  Let's work together to get the most out of this game. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
