"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 65-35 is a better starting point, considering the inflation we need to be mindful of. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, we do need to account for inflation.
