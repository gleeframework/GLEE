Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Inflation is biting, but I'd rather we both get something fair than risk losing even more.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to take a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point.  Rejecting it means going into another round where the value of my share decreases even further.  I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing."
