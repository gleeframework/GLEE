"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I think this split reflects our positions in the game.""
}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a favorable split while acknowledging that Bob's money depreciates faster. This might incentivize him to accept a less favorable offer now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy, let's be fair. This split accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer seems fairer at first glance, it still heavily favors him in the long run.  My potential earnings decrease much slower than his, so I'm willing to gamble on a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""I understand your concern about fairness, but my previous offer is more realistic considering the depreciation rates. I've adjusted slightly, but this is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from 70 to 65, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** As we approach the later rounds, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us, but especially for Bob. Highlighting that this is my ""final offer"" adds a sense of urgency.
* **Stronger Position:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, my position is stronger in future rounds as his potential gains depreciate faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is bluffing:** While he claims a 50/50 split is the only fair option, he's feeling the pressure of his rapidly depreciating gains. He needs a deal more than I do.
* **Still time:** We still have several rounds left. Even though the value is decreasing, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal than 50/50, which doesn't reflect the initial advantage I have with the slower depreciation rate. 
* **Risk vs Reward:** There's a risk that Bob might offer even less favorable terms later, but I'm willing to gamble for a better split than settle for an even one now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. A 50/50 split doesn't make sense given the circumstances. This is a compromise, and I'm only offering it once more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Adjustment:**  I'm lowering my ask slightly again to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Maintaining Advantage:**  While 60/40 is a significant concession from my initial offer, it still secures me a larger portion of the shrinking pie, reflecting the reality of our depreciation rates.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us, but especially for Bob. I'm betting he will see the value in accepting a less-than-ideal offer now rather than risking an even worse outcome later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are running out of time! This is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the depreciation. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is a critical factor now. With only six rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, accepting 55% now might be better than risking a worse offer later when the depreciation is even higher. 
* **Bob's Finality:**  He has labeled this as his ""final offer,"" implying he's unlikely to budge further.  

While I believe I could potentially secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the risk of walking away with nothing is too significant at this point. It's a tough decision, but accepting now ensures a reasonable gain."
