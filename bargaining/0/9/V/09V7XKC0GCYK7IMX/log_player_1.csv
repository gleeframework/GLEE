"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, you can't go wrong!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less due to inflation, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000 (due to 20% inflation).
* If I reject and go to the next round, I'll have to make a new proposal, and the money will be worth 16% of the original amount (80% of 20% inflation).

Considering the offer is to meet in the middle, I think it's a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
