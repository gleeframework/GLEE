"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split a bit more than half-half to get started. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's worth holding out to see if Alice is willing to offer more in later rounds, especially given the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust in later rounds if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, how about a slight adjustment for a more agreeable split?  We need to find a compromise soon. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is willing to compromise, and the offer is close to a 50/50 split. Accepting ensures both of us get a significant amount of money, especially considering the inflation factor."
