"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair share, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less than before, and I need to consider that. However, I still have a significant amount of money at stake.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $400,000, and the money is worth 20% less each round, I'll aim to offer him a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer. Considering the money is worth less for him each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a relatively good deal considering the circumstances.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
