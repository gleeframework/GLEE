"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 50/50 split, especially since I'm now earning 20% less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share to get the game going again. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm already getting a smaller share, I think 75-25 is a decent compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer to move forward."
