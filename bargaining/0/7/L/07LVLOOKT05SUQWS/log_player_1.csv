"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise. It ensures both of us get a good portion, and it avoids any further potential loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
