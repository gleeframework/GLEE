"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a proposal that benefits me slightly.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept an unfair split, but I'm not being overly greedy.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Since Bob is willing to give me a larger share, it's likely he's going to continue to propose offers that benefit me.  Plus, the inflation rate means that each round I wait, I'll get less.  It's time to take the deal."
