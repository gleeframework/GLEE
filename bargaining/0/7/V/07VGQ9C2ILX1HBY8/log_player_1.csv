"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me the majority of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $6000 is equivalent to $4800 in the first round, which is a good chunk of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
