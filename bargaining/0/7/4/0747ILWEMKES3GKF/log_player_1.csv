Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a generous offer given that the money is worth more to me than it is to Bob. I am confident he will accept it.  Let's see if he's reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! Even though his offer is worth less to him due to the inflation, he is still trying to take the lion's share. I won't accept this.  It's my turn to make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit and offer Bob 40% of the money. While this is still a majority for me, it shows I'm willing to negotiate. With inflation increasing, this might be the best option for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky. Inflation is hitting hard, and Bob's offer is getting more reasonable. While I'm still losing out significantly, taking 40% is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds. I'll accept it."
