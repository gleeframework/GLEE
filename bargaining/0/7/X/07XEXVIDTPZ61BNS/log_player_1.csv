"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and can adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's reasoning, and I think a 55/45 split is still too skewed towards him. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split. Let's try to find a more balanced solution.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking the risk of rejection.""
}
```"
