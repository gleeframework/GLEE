Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  It's a gamble, but I figure if Bob rejects, he'll be the one making the offer next round, and he'll be less likely to be as generous since he'll be worried about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the $1000 now than risk getting nothing in a later round.  The inflation is probably going to keep escalating, so Bob is likely going to be less generous with each round."
