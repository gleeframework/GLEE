"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take $8,000 and give Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since my gain is worth 20% less, $8,000 is now equivalent to $6,400. And since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, $2,000 is now equivalent to $1,800.

Bob's offer is $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him, which is a better deal than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.
