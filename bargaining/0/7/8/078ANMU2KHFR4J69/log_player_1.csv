"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%. It's a good compromise, and we can still negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still quite skewed in his favor, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. I need a fair deal to make up for the lost value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more even split, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'd rather try to get a bit more. However, I don't want to reject another offer and risk Bob making an even worse one.

I'll accept this offer, but only because it's a relatively fair split and I don't want to risk getting less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take 50% of the remaining value of the money, which is better than risking less."
