Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think I deserve a bigger share, considering the initial proposal I made was 50/50. His offer is too one-sided, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. The share I'm being offered is ridiculously small, and I'm not willing to accept it. I think Bob is trying to lowball me, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
