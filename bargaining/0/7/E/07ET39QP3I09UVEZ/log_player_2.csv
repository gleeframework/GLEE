"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob.  Even though it's only the first round, it's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal for both of us. Let's end this before the money starts to depreciate!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This is a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a significant amount of money. Let's avoid losing everything! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer in round 1 was terrible, this offer is much better. Bob is getting a significant amount of money, and the risk of further inflation is too high. It's time to take the deal."
