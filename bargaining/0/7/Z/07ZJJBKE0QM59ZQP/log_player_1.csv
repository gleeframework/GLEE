"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars, leaving Bob with 30 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get the better end of the deal in the early rounds to account for the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 49 dollars is worth even less than I initially thought. I'll have to be more careful with my next offer. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split, but still trying to get the better end of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is worth even less than I initially thought. Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll accept this one to avoid further losses due to inflation.
