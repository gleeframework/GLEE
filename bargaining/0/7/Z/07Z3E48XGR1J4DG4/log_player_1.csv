"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Bob's offer is for 300,000, which is worth 90% of 400,000 (the amount I proposed in Round 1), I'll think about it.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather not give up 400,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too little for me. I'll think of a new proposal.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a slight increase in my share compared to Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Let me calculate the actual values:

My gain in Round 1 was $400,000, which is worth 73% of the original amount in Round 4 ($400,000 * 0.271 = $108,400).
Bob's gain in Round 1 was $700,000, which is worth 86.74% of the original amount in Round 4 ($700,000 * 0.1426 = $996,980).

Considering the offers, I think I should be getting a bit more, given the decreasing value of money. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'll think of a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to adjust my strategy.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a slight increase in my share compared to Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to maximize my gain while still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet! I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to adjust my strategy again.

Let me calculate the actual values:

My gain in Round 1 was $400,000, which is worth 59.05% of the original amount in Round 6 ($400,000 * 0.4095 = $163,800).
Bob's gain in Round 1 was $700,000, which is worth 77.38% of the original amount in Round 6 ($700,000 * 0.2262 = $158,034).

Considering the offers, I think I should be getting a bit more, given the decreasing value of money. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with that. I'll think of a new proposal.""
}
```

However, I should note that my gain in Round 6 is actually lower than in Round 1, and I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer. I might be better off accepting it, but I'll try to negotiate further.

Wait, no! I'll reconsider my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Actually, I'll accept your offer. I'm not sure I can do better than this.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to adjust my strategy again.

Since the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. However, I also need to be cautious, as the value of money is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'll give you a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing this game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase in my share compared to Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to maximize my gain while still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
