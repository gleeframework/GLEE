"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a bold move. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive to get a good deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, but considering the reduced value of the money, I'll take it.
