"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll make the first offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm making the first move. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
* Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less than before. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value (80% of 80% of the original amount), I'll aim for a more balanced split.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3000, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% of its original value (80% of 80% of 80% of the original amount). Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: 3000 * 0.488 = 1470.4
* Bob gain: 7000 * 0.488 = 3417.6

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a bit better than my previous rejection. I'll accept Bob's offer.
