Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is a good deal considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot, but rejecting this offer is very risky.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 59.04% inflation means I'm getting a severely reduced amount compared to earlier rounds.
* **Alice Knows Time Is On Her Side:**  She's likely to offer me even less in the next round, knowing the value diminishes rapidly for me. 
* **Anything Could Happen:** There's no guarantee I'll get another offer. 

While not ideal, taking $4,500 is better than risking getting even less or nothing at all."
