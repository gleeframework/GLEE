Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think a more even split reflects the current inflation rate.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer (Round 2):**

* **Alice Gain:** $4500 
* **Bob Gain:** $5500

**Inflation Impact:**

* My $4500 is now worth only 90% of its value in Round 1. 
* Bob's $5500 is worth 95% of its value in Round 1.

**Decision:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it still favors him, especially considering the faster inflation working against me. I need to incentivize him to take a deal sooner rather than later.  I'll reject this offer and propose something slightly better for him in the next round, hoping he sees the value in settling quickly.
