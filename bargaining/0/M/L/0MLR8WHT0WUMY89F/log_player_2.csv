"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There are still many rounds left, and the inflation will start to eat away at the value of the money if I don't get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Alice $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm taking a bit more this round, but I'm still leaving a significant portion for Alice, hoping to make a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has upped her offer, and while the inflation has taken a bite out of my potential gains, I'd rather take what's offered and secure something than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
