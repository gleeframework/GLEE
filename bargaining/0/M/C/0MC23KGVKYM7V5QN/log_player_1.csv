Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split.  I'll take the bigger share since I'm the one facing the devaluation, but it's still close to a 50/50 split.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
