Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's losing value for me.  I'll agree to a bit closer to even, but I still need a slight advantage to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
