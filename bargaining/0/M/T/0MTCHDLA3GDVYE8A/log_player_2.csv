Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the safest move. With each round, the value of the money drops significantly, especially for Alice. It's unlikely she'll offer a better deal, and rejecting could lead to us both getting nothing."
