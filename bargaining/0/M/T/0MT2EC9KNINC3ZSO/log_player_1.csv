"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and keep 600k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, offering Bob 400k, which is 40% of the total. This way, we both have a decent amount to work with for the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain and Bob would gain are:

* My gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000
* Bob's gain: 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000

With this in mind, I think Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I'd like. I'd rather not meet him in the middle just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. This is a good compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, while still trying to maintain a decent balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.7239 (1 - 0.2761) = 289,556
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 309,720

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I think I should accept this offer, as it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money before the value continues to decrease.
