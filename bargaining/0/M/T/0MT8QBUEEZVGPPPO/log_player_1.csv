"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you $250,000. Accept and we can wrap up the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I think I'll have to accept this offer. I'd rather get a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting nothing if we reach the 12th round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
