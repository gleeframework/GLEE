"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a fair one 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll accept the offer since it's still a decent split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds where the money will be worth even less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
