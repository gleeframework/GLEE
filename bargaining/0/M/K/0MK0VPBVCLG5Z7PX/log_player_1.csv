"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game, but I'm also leaving the door open for him to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to do better this time. You can't expect everything for free! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and giving him the opportunity to make another proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. So, I'll aim for a higher gain to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make up for the losses due to inflation.""
}
```

This offer gives me $7,200 and Bob $2,800. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to squeeze out a better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. In Round 4, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is as good as it gets. I'm accepting your offer.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and I'll take $7,000. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point, considering the inflation."
