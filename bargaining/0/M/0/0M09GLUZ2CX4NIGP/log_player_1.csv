I propose a 90/10 split in my favor,  Alice. This should be a fair starting point considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still believe a fair share of the pie should go to me. Let's get this deal done before the inflation hits too hard."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering 70/30 in my favor. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and we need to reach an agreement soon.  I'm confident this is a fair offer, considering the current inflation rates."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm lowering my offer to 60/40.  We're running out of time, and I need to start being more realistic. This is my last offer.  Let's come to an agreement before the inflation eats away any more of the money."

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, the inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm worried we'll end up with nothing.  It's better to accept a smaller share than lose everything."
