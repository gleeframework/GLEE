Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. The value is decreasing for you with each round. I'm offering you a significant portion to make this worthwhile for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the money is worth even less for you! This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the offer than to risk getting nothing at all, as the inflation is heavily impacting Bob's gains."
