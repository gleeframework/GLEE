Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, inflation is eating into your share. I'll give a bit, but not 50/50. How about 58.75-41.25? 
# Bob gain: 412500 
# Alice gain: 587500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round due to the 5% inflation.  Waiting any longer means a dramatically smaller payout even if he gets a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Unlikely Shift:** Alice has consistently offered splits favoring herself. It's improbable she'll suddenly propose a drastically better deal for Bob, especially knowing the pressure of inflation is on him. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting risks getting even less in later rounds, especially if Alice is stubborn or calculates that Bob will eventually have to accept a worse deal.

While not ideal, taking 41.25% now is better than gambling on an increasingly unlikely chance of getting a significantly better share later."
