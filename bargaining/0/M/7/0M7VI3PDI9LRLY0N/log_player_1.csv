"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and hoping Bob will accept!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the lead!

I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can move forward.""
