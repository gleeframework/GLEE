"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first one to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept this offer. At least I'll get a guaranteed amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.
