I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. Hopefully, he'll see the value in ending the game early and I can secure almost the entire pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I lose 5% of the value of my share each round, Bob's offer is the fairest outcome.  I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round, and I risk losing more money."
