"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, I'm not sure how much Bob's offer is really worth. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is worth even less than it was in the previous round, so I'm not too concerned about giving him a slightly better deal.

I'll accept this offer.
