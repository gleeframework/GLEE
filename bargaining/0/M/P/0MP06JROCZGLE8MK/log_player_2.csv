{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand your higher inflation rate, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, given that we are both facing inflation.  Let's settle this in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but letting this drag on hurts us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation difference while still offering you a sizable portion. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
