**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases.  While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, she's likely to offer even more favorable terms as we get closer to the deadline. I'm betting on her risk aversion increasing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical. This is a fair deal, especially with the time pressure. Accepting this benefits us both more than dragging it out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point. While I'm still aiming for a slight advantage, offering a 50/50 split highlights the urgency of the situation.  
* **Shift in Tone:** The message aims to appear more reasonable and less aggressive. Alice is likely feeling the pressure too, and a calm approach might be more effective. 
* **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this offer, it demonstrates a strong desire for a larger share, even at the cost of significant losses due to inflation. This gives me leverage in future rounds to push for a slightly higher percentage."
