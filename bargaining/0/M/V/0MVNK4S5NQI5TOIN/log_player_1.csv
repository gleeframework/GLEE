Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further reductions in value from the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
