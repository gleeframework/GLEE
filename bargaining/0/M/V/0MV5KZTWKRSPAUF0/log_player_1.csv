Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob's offer is 60-40 in his favor, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer.

Since the numbers are similar to my previous offer, and Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, I'll decide to reject it.
