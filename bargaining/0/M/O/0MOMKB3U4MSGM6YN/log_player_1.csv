"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid the risk of inflation.  I'll take 90% and give Bob 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While he's offering me a larger percentage than I initially offered him, the inflation means that my actual gain is much smaller.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 40% of the money, which is more than he offered me in the previous round, but still less than I initially wanted. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, given the continuing inflation."
