"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm proposing to give Bob a decent chunk of the money right off the bat. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split! That's a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject it for now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
