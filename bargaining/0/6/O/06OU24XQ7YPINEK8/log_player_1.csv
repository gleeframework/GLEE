I'm going to take a greedy approach in the first round and offer Bob a very small amount. I figure it's better to get most of the money now than risk losing a significant portion in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth the risk of getting nothing if Bob rejects again. With the 20% inflation, any further rounds would result in a smaller share for me.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point."
