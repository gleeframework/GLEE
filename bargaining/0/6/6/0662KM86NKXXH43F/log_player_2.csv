Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split now 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Alice is trying to take advantage of inflation to get a better deal. While the offer is closer to even, I believe I can still negotiate for a better outcome in the remaining rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're running out of time and the money is losing value. This offer is fair and benefits us both.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money, let's compromise and meet halfway between our last offers 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to inch towards a better deal for herself by suggesting a 'compromise'. It's clear she's feeling the pressure of the dwindling value. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and see if I can get her to agree to a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair and it's the closest we've been to a deal. Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more.""}"
