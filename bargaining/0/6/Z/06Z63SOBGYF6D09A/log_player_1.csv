"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'll take the lead this round. You can have 40%. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 55-45 split. You can have a bit more this round, but I'm still holding out for a better deal""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still willing to compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
