"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount even if the value decreases slightly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'm not sure I want to accept a 60/40 split. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation factor. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I still want a decent amount for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
