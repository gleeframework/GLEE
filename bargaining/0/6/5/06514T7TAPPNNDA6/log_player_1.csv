"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This leaves a good amount for Bob, but also gives me a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money.  Waiting for another round risks the value of my share diminishing further due to inflation, and there's no guarantee of a better offer."
