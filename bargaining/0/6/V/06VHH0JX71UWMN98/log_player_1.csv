Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This is the best deal for both of us with time running out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is still not in my best interest.  While time is a factor, I believe I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
