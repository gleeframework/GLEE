"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a fair starting offer, considering Bob is losing 20% of the value per round. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is now a good deal for me due to the inflation. My share is worth less with each round, and Bob's offer ensures I get something, even though it's smaller than what I initially proposed."
