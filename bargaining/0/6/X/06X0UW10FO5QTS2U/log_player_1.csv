"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, so I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still have $8,000 in real value.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but he's only offering me $6,000 in nominal value, which is 25% less than what I was initially offering him.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, my offer of $8,000 in round 1 is now equivalent to $6,400 in real value.

I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob rejected my initial offer and the fact that the money is worth less now.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the total, and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still have $8,000 in real value.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, his gain of $5,000 is now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money continuing to lose value.
