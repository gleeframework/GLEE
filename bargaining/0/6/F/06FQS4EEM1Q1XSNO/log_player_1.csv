"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer.  I want to see how Bob reacts and if he is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer and I'm happy to accept. While I would have preferred to get more, it's better to take a good deal than risk getting nothing."
