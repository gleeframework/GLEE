"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, as I'm getting less than half of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to make up for the lost value. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, where I get a slightly larger share to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on my share! I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting only 30% of the total amount, I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of my share.
