"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take a small share to start, but we can negotiate in the future!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a middle ground. This is my final offer -  a 70/30 split in my favor.  Let's not let this money disappear! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, accepting now would still give her a significant advantage.  It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and the threat of losing everything looms larger."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the time pressure tactic, but her idea of ""fair"" is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a more equitable split.  The risk is increasing, but so is the potential loss for both of us."
