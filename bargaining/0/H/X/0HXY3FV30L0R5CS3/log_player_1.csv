"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to start the negotiation process."
