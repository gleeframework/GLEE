"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 50/50 split is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take into account the potential for inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 this round, with me getting the larger share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even with the inflation, this is a better deal than what I would have gotten in round 2. It's better to secure some money than to risk losing more in the next round."
