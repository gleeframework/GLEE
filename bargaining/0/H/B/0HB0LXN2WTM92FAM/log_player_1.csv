Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is a bit cheeky, but it sets the stage for a potential negotiation. It highlights your desire for the majority of the money, but still leaves a tiny sliver for Bob. It's also important to remember that the inflation rate means that the money is worth less every round, so you want to get a good deal as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have loved to get more, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money, which is better than risking it all for a potentially smaller share in the later rounds."
