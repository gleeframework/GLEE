"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but Bob will still get a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, $5000 is actually equivalent to $4500 in the first round. Still, it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
