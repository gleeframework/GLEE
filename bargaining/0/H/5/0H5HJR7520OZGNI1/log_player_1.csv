"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I'm not sure it's the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the second round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the adjusted values.

For me, the offer is:

* Alice gain: 50
* Bob gain: 50

Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
