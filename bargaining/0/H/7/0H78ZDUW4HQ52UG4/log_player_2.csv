Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Accepting $450,000 is better than risking even less in further rounds."
