Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better in future rounds""

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping $550,000 for myself, which is 55%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, but I'm willing to start with a slightly more favorable split for myself.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not satisfied with the split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 55% of the value, I think I can do better""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, considering the money is worth 5% less now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
