"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get more than half to make up for the loss in value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60-40 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60-40 is still too much in your favor. How about 55-45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nThe offer is closer to what I'm looking for, but considering the inflation, I'm actually getting less value than the initial 50-50 split. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, so I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a bit more to make up for the loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. How about 52-48? This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation at this point, accepting 48 is a better option than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The difference between offers is becoming marginal, and it's better to secure this amount now rather than possibly ending up with less value later."
