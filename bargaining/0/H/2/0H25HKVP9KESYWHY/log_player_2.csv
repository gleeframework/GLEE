"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Discount:**  The money loses value with each round. It's crucial to get a deal done sooner rather than later.
* **Alice's Declining Position:** Alice's offer of 6000 for herself in Round 1 would be worth only 5400 in Round 2 (a 10% decrease).
* **Bob's Declining Position:** Similarly, a 50/50 split (5000 each) in Round 1 would be worth only 4000 for Bob in Round 2 (a 20% decrease).
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering 5500 to Bob and 4500 to Alice is a strong strategic move:
    * It's a better deal for Bob than waiting for another round.
    * It's still better than what Alice can expect to receive in Round 3 if she rejects (her 6000 ask becomes worth approximately 4860).

This offer incentivizes Alice to accept, as it's a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure of the game's rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, don't wait 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Declining Value:**  The inflation is hitting hard.  Even though Alice's offer is proportionally worse than her first offer, waiting any longer is too risky.
* **Potential Losses:** If we reject and go to Round 4, even if we could secure the entire pot for Bob, it would be worth significantly less than 4200 now due to the 36% reduction each round.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure of inflation too and is unlikely to offer much better.

While not ideal, taking this offer cuts our losses and ensures we get something from this deal."
