Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It accounts for the risk I'm taking by letting this pot shrink. Don't be greedy, accept and let's end this.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about the risk. This is my final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take a small loss to end this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning: 

While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 3 is the best I'm likely to get. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting longer means a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language (""final offer"", ""willing to take a small loss"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, my offer in round 4 will need to be appealing enough to get Alice to accept, considering she'll be getting even less due to inflation.  It's risky.

Taking 450,000 now is better than risking a worse outcome later.
