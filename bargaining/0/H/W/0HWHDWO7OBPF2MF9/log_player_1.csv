"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we're both taking a risk by rejecting the previous offer. Let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and the money is worth less each round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than the initial 40/60 split, but I'm not sure about the 55/45 split. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but 55/45 is a bit steep for me. How about 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous suggestion of a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable division, considering the risks we're taking. Let's agree on this and move forward.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
