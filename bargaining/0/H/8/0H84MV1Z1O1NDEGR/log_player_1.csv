I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  Since the inflation hurts Bob more, I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy, and I'm not going to let him get away with it! I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm still trying to get a good share, but I'm also recognizing that the inflation is hurting me too.  I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer, but still keep a significant chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not going to give up easily. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is starting to really bite, and I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to be greedy. I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise at this point.  I'm hoping Bob will see it the same way."
