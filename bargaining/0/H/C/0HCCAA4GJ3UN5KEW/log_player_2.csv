"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a slightly larger share, but we both get a good amount. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn. How about this? It's a bit more in my favor since I'm taking on more risk with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with each round, so let's split it evenly and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is less than ideal due to inflation, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
