"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased for me, but not for Bob.

I'll decide to reject this offer. The proposed gain for me is $40, but considering the inflation, it's equivalent to $38 in the first round's value. I'm not satisfied with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher value for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
