"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is still worth 50% of the original amount, but Bob's share is worth 60% of the original amount. This is a better deal for me.

I accept the offer.
