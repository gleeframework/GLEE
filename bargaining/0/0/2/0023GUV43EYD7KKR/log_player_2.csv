"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 64, ""alice_gain"": 36}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I'd gain is 70 * 0.36 = 25.2, and Alice would gain 30 * 0.36 = 10.8. My offer is not as favorable as Alice's. I'll accept her offer.
