"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous, but I'm also looking out for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, I'll take the majority this time! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take the majority this time!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm not as motivated to accept an offer that gives me a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. I need to be more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being very generous, I'll take what's left! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is being aggressive!

Considering the severe inflation, my gain of $50,000 is actually a relatively small amount. However, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, especially since he's being so confident.

I'll think carefully about this offer...
