"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. I suggest we each take $600000 and $400000 respectively. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair that we both get a significant share of the money. I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor, recognizing your generosity in the previous round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of money decreases with each round, I propose we divide the money as 520000 for me and 480000 for you. This way, we both benefit from the initial proposal while accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. This deal still provides a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high."
