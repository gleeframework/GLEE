"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 dollars and keep 60 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm keeping a bit more for myself to see if Bob will try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair offer, but I think we can do better. Let's flip the script this time, how about you take 40 and I take 60? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script and get a better deal for himself. However, I'm not convinced that this is the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not interested in flipping the script, I'd like to make a new offer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, I think we can both be happy with this. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm making a more even split this time, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
