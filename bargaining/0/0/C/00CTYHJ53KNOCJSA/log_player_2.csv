Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that's more favorable to me. I think Alice might accept it since she rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is even worse than the first round, despite the fact that the money is worth less for her.  I'm going to keep rejecting until I get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and get a bit more than last time, but I need to be careful, as the inflation is starting to hurt.  I'm hoping that Alice will see that her money is worth much less than it was before and accept a deal that's more fair to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting ridiculous!  Even though my money is worth significantly less, I'm not going to accept a deal where I get such a small share. I'll keep rejecting until she comes to her senses and offers me a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try one last time to get a decent share.  Alice's money is worth significantly less than it was in the beginning, so I'm hoping she'll realize that a deal that's fair to both of us is better than getting a smaller share of something that's worth much less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500 
# Alice gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being completely unreasonable! I'm not going to accept an offer where I'm getting a tiny fraction of the money, even though it's worth less for both of us. This is not a fair division.  I'll continue to reject her offers until she comes to her senses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going all in this round. Alice's money is practically worthless at this point, and I'm hoping she'll realize that getting a small amount of something that's worth very little isn't a good deal. I'm taking a big risk, but I'm confident she'll accept this offer."
