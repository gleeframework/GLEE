"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm starting with a relatively fair split to see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the cash! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is still quite lopsided. I'll reject it and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still trying to get a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want to hold on to some cash. You're getting a better deal, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. Although I would have liked a more even split, I'm getting a decent share of the money and Bob is getting a smaller share. I'm not sure if Bob will make another offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the 75$ I'd get from this offer."
