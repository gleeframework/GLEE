"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair division. Since it's the first round, there's no inflation effect yet. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the inflation effect. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since it's the second round, the money Bob gains is worth 10% less due to inflation. Considering this, Bob's offer of $5500 for himself is actually equivalent to $4950 in real value ($5500 * 0.9), while Alice's gain remains at face value, $4500.\n\nGiven this adjusted perspective, let's decide whether to accept or reject the offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nThe decision is to reject Bob's offer, considering the inflation effect and the real value of the money. Now, it's Alice's turn again to make a proposal for dividing the $10,000, taking into account the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on Bob's gains."
