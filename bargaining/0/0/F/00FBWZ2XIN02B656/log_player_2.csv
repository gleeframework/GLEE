"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This ensures fairness and avoids any potential disputes. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a very lopsided offer, and I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'll see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split. I'm happy to negotiate further if you'd like.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 60/40 split would be fair, considering the diminishing value of money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still heavily weighted in Alice's favor.  I'm hoping we can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid further negotiation.""}
