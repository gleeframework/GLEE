Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was unfair. Let's be reasonable, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts me more.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I'm getting a decent deal because of the inflation.  I'll take $65, and you get $35. It's better than what you'll get if you reject this. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
