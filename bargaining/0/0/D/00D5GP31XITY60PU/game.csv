600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money 3:2 in favor of Alice to ensure fairness.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I believe a 55:45 split is a fair and equitable way to divide the money. This allows for a compromise while ensuring that both of us receive a significant portion of the winnings.,Bob,2,
