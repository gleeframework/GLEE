I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's get this over with!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to be stingy!

After considering the offer, I decide to reject it. The money is worth even less now due to inflation, and I'm not getting a fair share. I'd like to make my own offer to try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% less now, and I want to make sure I get a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get the better deal. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob is being stubborn.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the deal, but I'm not getting any younger (or richer). The money is worth even less now, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping it's the best I'll get.
