"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair, but be warned, with each round, the money's worth less for both of us. Let's be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in terms of a straight percentage split, it's important to remember the inflation factor. The money is worth less with each round, and I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get half, and we can avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation.""}
