"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and keeping $900,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to weigh that in my decision. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money I'd gain in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and keeping $700,000 for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth even less due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the reduced value of the money, $400,000 is a better deal for me than waiting for another round and potentially getting even less."
