"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is an extremely unfair offer, and Bob should reject it. Even though the money is worth less to Bob in the next round, it's still better than getting nothing. There's also a chance that Alice will make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is better than the first round, it's still not very equitable.  Bob should continue to push for a fairer split. He's losing more money with each round, but there's still a chance he can secure a larger share of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}
``` 
Bob should continue to offer a fair split while still maximizing his share. Since Alice rejected the last offer, Bob should offer a slightly smaller share for himself while still keeping the split relatively even."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's share of the money is becoming increasingly devalued with each passing round. While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best he's likely to get. Alice has shown a pattern of being stubborn and unwilling to compromise, making it unlikely she'll offer anything more favorable in the future. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets something instead of ending up with nothing."
