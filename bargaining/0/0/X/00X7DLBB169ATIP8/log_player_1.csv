"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's call it a draw! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the idea of meeting in the middle and splitting it 50/50. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45. I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to meeting me in the middle, keep going! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. I was trying to make a more generous offer in round 3, and now he's pushing me to meet him even closer to the middle. I'd like to try to get a better deal, especially since my money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the initial $100, which is $52, and Bob gets the remaining 48%, which is $48. I'm trying to make another slightly more generous offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle now! 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think it's time to stop pushing for a better deal and accept a compromise. Meeting in the middle might not be my ideal outcome, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting an even worse deal due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer and split the remaining $100 with him."
