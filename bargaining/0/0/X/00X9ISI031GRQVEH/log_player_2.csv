# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving at a snail's pace, increasing her offer by only $100 each round.  It's clear she's hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the deadline. I need to hold firm and make her realize I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly rattled by my previous offer but still refuses to budge significantly.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to maintain my strong position.  She needs to understand I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, let's split reasonably 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is it, the penultimate round.  Alice is clearly not budging from her slow, incremental increases. If I reject this, there's a very high chance she'll offer me the bare minimum in the last round, leaving me with a worse outcome than this. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable, albeit not ideal, amount."
