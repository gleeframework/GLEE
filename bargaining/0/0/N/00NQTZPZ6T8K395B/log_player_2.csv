Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split it 6400 for me and 3600 for you. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 3600
