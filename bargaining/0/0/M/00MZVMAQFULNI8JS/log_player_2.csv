Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

While ideally, I would have liked to secure a slightly larger share, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Alice's potential gain is rapidly decreasing. It's already at 59.04% less than its original worth and will continue to plummet. This puts increasing pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become even more desperate and accept a less favorable offer for herself, or the game could continue to a point where the overall value is significantly reduced for both of us.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is a reasonable compromise at this stage. It reflects the time pressure and the impact of the decreasing value on Alice's side. 

In essence, accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable payout and avoids the risk of walking away with significantly less if the game continues to drag on.
