"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about getting only 40 dollars.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars."
