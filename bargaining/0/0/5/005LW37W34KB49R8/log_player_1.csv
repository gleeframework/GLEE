"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but it's still better than nothing 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. The 20% decrease in the value of Bob's offer due to inflation doesn't seem like a good trade-off for me, especially since I'm still getting a relatively small share. I'd like to see if Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground between the initial 60-40 and the 40-60 offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the decrease in the value of Bob's offer due to inflation is significant, and I'm not convinced that he's willing to give up enough to make it worthwhile. I'd like to see if Bob will make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no more haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a fair and equal division of the $10,000."
