# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! I'm getting worried that I'll end up with nothing if I don't make a smart move.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him such a large share, but I don't want to risk getting nothing either. I'll have to think carefully about this one...
