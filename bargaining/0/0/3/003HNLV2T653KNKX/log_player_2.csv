"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining money fairly! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take the $200,000, but it's only 20% of the total. There's a lot of potential for a better deal, even with the inflation.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way we both get a good amount and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the first round, I'm still not happy with the 64/36 split. The inflation has significantly affected Alice's side more than mine, so I'm going to see if I can get an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to reflect the inflation, but I think a 45/55 split is a fair compromise. We can end this now and both walk away with a good amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's try to find a fair middle ground? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a good compromise, considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's side.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to end the game and avoid further potential losses due to inflation."
