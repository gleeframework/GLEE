"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total, and keep 80%. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but not so small that he'll reject the offer. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. You can have 70% and I'll take 30. It's still a fair split, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to give up 30% of the total, but Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. My offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'll take 63% and you can have 37%. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share. I'll give you 60% and take 40. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give up 40% of the total, but Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired share.

However, I'm not convinced that 60% is the best I can get. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 544200,
  ""bob_gain"": 455800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the 55% mark, Bob. I'll give you 45.58% and take the rest. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm being a bit more aggressive in this round, trying to get closer to my desired share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you at the 50/50 mark. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

Splitting the money evenly at 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. It's a fair and simple solution, as Bob said.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 50% share. It's not the most optimal outcome, but it's a fair and reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
