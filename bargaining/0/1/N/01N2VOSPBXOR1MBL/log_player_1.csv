"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio, giving you $25 and receiving $75. This ensures we both have a share while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share now, but I think it's a fair starting point. We can reassess in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
