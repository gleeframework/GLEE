"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still thinking about the initial 60 dollars I proposed. However, I don't want to go back to the negotiation table, so I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
