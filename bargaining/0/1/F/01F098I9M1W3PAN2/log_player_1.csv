I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this over quickly.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, and the inflation is already starting to bite. I'm not willing to accept this deal so early in the game. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping that he'll see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still not ready to settle for this low of an offer. I need to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer again, but I'm still offering a sizable portion to Bob.  I'm hoping that this will be a fair compromise that he's willing to accept. Inflation is really starting to hurt now, so I need to close the deal before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the inflation is making this game very risky. I'm not going to give in to this kind of pressure, and I'll continue to negotiate for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still offering a substantial portion to Bob. Inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to close this deal soon.  I hope Bob will recognize the value of a guaranteed amount of money, even if it's less than he's hoping for."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to squeeze me with the inflation, but I'm not giving in to his demands. It's starting to get risky with every round, but I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation is getting increasingly severe, and I'm starting to worry about the risks of going any lower. This is a fair deal, and I hope Bob will recognize that."
