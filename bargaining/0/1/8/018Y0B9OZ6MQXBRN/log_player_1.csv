Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a bit aggressive, but I want to see how Bob reacts and see if we can get to a resolution quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too unfavorable. While my gains are worth less due to inflation, 20/80 is too far from a fair split. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation impact, but still provides a decent amount for Bob. I think this is a fair offer that could lead to an agreement."
