Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a split that acknowledges the difference in our inflation rates, but gives us both a substantial portion of the money. Let's be practical, we both lose value if we continue this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
