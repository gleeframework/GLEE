600000.0,400000.0,I propose we split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for us both to benefit before inflation eats away at it.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,Let's split things a bit more evenly. This ensures we both benefit significantly.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I offered 60/40, you countered with almost the reverse.  This is my counter-offer, take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, time is running out.  This offer is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close the deal before inflation eats away more of our potential gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you closer to the middle, but this is my final offer. We're both losing money with each round.",Alice,5,
