"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm also trying to get a slightly higher amount to give me some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $50 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $47.50 in terms of the original value.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation, since his gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the decrease in value. Since my $50 in the previous round was worth $47.50 in terms of the original value, I'll aim to get a bit more this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise""
}
