"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
