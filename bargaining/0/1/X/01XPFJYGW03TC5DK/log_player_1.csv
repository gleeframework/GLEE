{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as I'm taking a little more than half but still leaving a decent chunk for Bob.  We'll see how he feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's true that the money is worth less now, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in the balance of power. I still have 11 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter with a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm willing to give up a little more to try and reach an agreement, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to make sure I get a decent share before it gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again.  While I understand the inflation is hurting Bob more than me at this point, this offer is still way too lopsided. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to settle for such a small share.  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting serious now, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  I believe a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  The inflation is really starting to take its toll, and I'm feeling the pressure to accept something. But I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to give up more than half of the money, especially since Bob is getting a much worse deal from the inflation. I still have several rounds left, and I'm going to hold out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to propose a 45/55 split in Bob's favor.  The inflation is really starting to bite now, and I need to get a deal done before it gets worse.  I'm willing to give up a little more to try and reach an agreement, but I'm still trying to get a reasonable share of the money.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to compromise at this point, as the stakes are getting higher with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Ok, I'll accept this offer. Even though inflation is hitting Bob much harder, I'm not sure I can get a better deal at this point. The pressure is really on, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I'll take the 450,000, it's better than nothing."
