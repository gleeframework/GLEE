"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm offering Bob a small portion to make sure he accepts the offer in the first round. This way, I get the most value out of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob is offering a significant portion of the money, I will reject this offer and continue to negotiate. This is a better deal than the first round, and by rejecting, I can potentially get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, aiming for a compromise. The inflation is starting to hit, and while I still want a good share, it's becoming more important to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob is offering significantly less than in the previous rounds, the inflation is getting worse.  It's a better deal than the last offer and I risk losing even more if I reject and get a worse offer in the next round.  This seems like the best deal I can get at this point."
