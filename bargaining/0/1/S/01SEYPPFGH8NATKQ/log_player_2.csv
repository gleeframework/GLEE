"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 3000 is worth about 9.75% less than my initial gain of 4000, so it's actually equivalent to about 3610 in the first round. And Alice's gain of 7000 is worth about 19% less than her initial gain of 6000, so it's actually equivalent to about 4880 in the first round.

Since this offer is still quite favorable to Alice, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a larger share. Here's my proposal:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the first round. My gain of 2500 is worth about 18.55% less than my initial gain of 4000, so it's actually equivalent to about 3280 in the first round. Alice's gain of 7500 is worth about 34.39% less than her initial gain of 6000, so it's actually equivalent to about 3940 in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.
