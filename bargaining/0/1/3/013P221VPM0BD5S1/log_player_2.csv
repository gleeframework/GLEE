I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal. 60-40 is a good starting point, but I want more! Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 57-43 is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still offering more than I think is fair, especially with inflation eating away at our gains.  I'm sticking to my guns and hoping she'll come down a bit more in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try to be reasonable. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60-40.  We're both losing value with each passing round, so let's find a compromise before it's too late.""}
