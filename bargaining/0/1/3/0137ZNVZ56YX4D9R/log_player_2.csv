Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll concede a bit, but I still think 56-44 is more reasonable than your 60-40. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is starting to concede, but it's still early. Holding out might lead to a better offer in the next few rounds, even if it means accepting a slightly less favorable split than 60/40.  The 20% decrease per round for Alice is significant and will hopefully lead to a more advantageous deal for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and every round makes the deal worse for you. I'm offering 62/38. Take it before it's too late!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We need to start applying more pressure.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but she needs to understand the time sensitivity. Increasing the pressure with a slightly higher demand (62/38) might be enough to get her to accept before the deal becomes significantly worse for her."
