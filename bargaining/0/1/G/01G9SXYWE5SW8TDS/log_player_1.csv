I'm proposing to take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob. This seems fair, considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is a real threat.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances.  Let's end this game!"
