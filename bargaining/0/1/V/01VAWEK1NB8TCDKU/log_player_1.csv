"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get him to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90%, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $900,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $100,000, which is worth 10% of the original amount, but due to inflation, it's now worth $90,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of the original amount, which is $810,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 70-30 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and ending the game quickly."
