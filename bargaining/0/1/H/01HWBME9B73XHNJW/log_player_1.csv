This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's also a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see it as reasonable and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is now offering a slightly better deal for himself, but it's still not very fair. I'm going to reject and see if he'll offer me a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split this time.  The inflation has made it less advantageous for both of us to hold out, and I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
