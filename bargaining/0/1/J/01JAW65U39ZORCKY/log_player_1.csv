"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but is willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel it's too lopsided, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a more balanced split. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to an equal split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than Bob's previous offer, but still gives him a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to an equal split, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's trying to take it back to a very uneven split! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's even more lopsided than his previous one, and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'd like to try to get a more balanced split again. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to give up a bit to get closer to a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
