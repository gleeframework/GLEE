"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to take a good deal, but next time, you won't get as much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my valuation accordingly.

Since I initially proposed a $6,000 gain, which is worth $6,000, and now it's worth 90% of that, which is $5,400. Bob's offer is $4,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.

Considering Bob's message and the fact that he's trying to make a ""good deal"" for me, I'll decide to reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the second round. Since my gain in the second round was worth $5,400, it's now worth 90% of that, which is $4,860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect me to give you the lion's share!""
}
```"
