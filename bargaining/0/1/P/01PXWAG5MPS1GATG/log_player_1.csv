"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Given the potential decrease in value, I propose we split it 70-30 in favor of efficiency and to ensure I retain a significant portion before inflation impacts the total.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60-40 is a fairer split given the inflation risk. It's still a significant portion for you, but I need to ensure I get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
