"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 3:1 ratio seems fair at first glance, the decreasing value of money means that I'm likely to get a better deal later if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
