Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. This deal considers the impact of inflation and provides a fair outcome for both of us. Let's close this deal before your potential earnings diminish further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is hurting my potential gains significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
