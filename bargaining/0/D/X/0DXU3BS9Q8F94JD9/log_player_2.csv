"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not sure how inflation will affect Alice, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair start. It accounts for the potential inflation we need to consider."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is now proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It's better to secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing in further rounds."
