I propose a 9000/1000 split. It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy. While I have to account for the inflation on my side, it's not worth it to accept such a drastically unfavorable offer. I'll keep playing and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the continued inflation. While I still want a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to secure a deal before it's too late. This offer is still advantageous for me given the inflation, and I hope Bob sees the value in it."
