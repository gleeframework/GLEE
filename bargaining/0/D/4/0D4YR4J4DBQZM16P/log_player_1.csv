"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now worth 90% of what I was in the first round, and Bob is worth 80% of what he was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is now worth significantly less. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept it. If I accept now, I'll be giving up a significant amount of money in real terms. On the other hand, if I reject and proceed, I might be able to get an even better deal in the next round.

I'll think carefully about this...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Since the money is now worth only 72.9% of its original value (1 - 0.271), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now. With the money worth only 59.05% of its original value (1 - 0.404), I'm starting to feel the pinch.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. While it's not a bad deal in absolute terms, it's still a relatively small share compared to the original value of the money.

However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, considering the continued erosion of the money's value. I'll think carefully about this...
