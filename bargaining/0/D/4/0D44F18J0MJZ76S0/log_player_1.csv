"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$, which is a good chunk, but still leaves Bob with a decent 20% as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's call it a day with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more careful with my next offer.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 45-55 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
