"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  This gives me a significant share, and it seems fair to give Bob a little something in the first round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, especially considering the inflation rate.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and increase my share a bit more this round, but still offer Bob a decent amount to hopefully encourage acceptance. I'm going to propose taking $800,000 and giving Bob $200,000.  With inflation eating away at our potential gains, it's important to find a compromise sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, especially considering the inflation rate. He's now offering me less than half the money, and the inflation is making his offer even more unfavorable.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer this round.  Bob is clearly trying to squeeze more money out of me, but I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting a smaller share is better than getting nothing at all.  I'm going to propose taking $700,000 and giving Bob $300,000.  We're running out of rounds, and I need to find a solution that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even with the inflation rate. While I need to find a solution, this offer is simply too low for me.  I need to hold out for something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway this round. With time running out, and inflation eating away at our gains, I think it's time to compromise. I'm going to propose a 60/40 split, offering Bob $400,000. This is still a decent amount for him, and it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even with the inflation rate.  I need to hold out for a better deal, or risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're running out of time, and inflation is getting worse. It's time to propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and equitable solution, and it's the best chance we have of reaching an agreement before both of us lose everything."
