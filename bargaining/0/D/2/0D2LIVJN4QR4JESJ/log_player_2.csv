Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal.  I take $70, you get $30.  It's better to take something now than risk getting less later.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. Let's split the money more evenly, with me getting slightly more to compensate for the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take the $35 now before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more! This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
