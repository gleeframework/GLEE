"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now.
