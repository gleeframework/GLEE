"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a lower value for my share. Considering Bob's proposal, I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid further rounds and potential further erosion of my share's value.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
