I'm starting with a bold offer. Let's see if Alice is willing to share the wealth a bit more evenly!"

This offer is better than the previous round and Alice is getting a better deal than I offered, so I'll take it.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers with inflation happening!"
