Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'll start with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point and gives Alice a decent amount. Hopefully, she'll see it's in her best interest to take it, since the money is worth less every round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering inflation. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
