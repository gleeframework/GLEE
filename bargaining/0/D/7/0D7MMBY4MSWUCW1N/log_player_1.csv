"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting us both!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll decide to reject this offer. I don't think I'm getting a fair share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need to keep something for myself. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""

  ""bob_gain"": 8800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to get something for myself. This is my final offer.""
