"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal for the next round."
