# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer was pretty far off. I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $55 for me and $45 for you? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take it. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait."
