"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting 800,000$ and Bob getting 200,000$. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, even if it's a slightly smaller share for me. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 split for a fair deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting 500,000$ and Bob getting 500,000$. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him in the middle and split the money evenly."
