"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation heavily favors him in the long run.  Here's why:

* **My Loss:**  Accepting this offer in Round 2 means I lose 5% of my potential gain from Round 1, making the $500,000 worth only $475,000 in real terms.
* **Bob's Gain:** Bob also experiences a 10% loss from his potential Round 1 gain, but it's less impactful. His $500,000 is worth $450,000 in real terms - still a good deal for him.

By rejecting this offer, I can propose a counter-offer in Round 3 that better reflects the changing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money!  I'm proposing a slight adjustment to account for the decreasing value. This benefits us both in the long run.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  I've slightly adjusted the split to account for the inflation we're both experiencing.  
* **Incentivizing Bob:** While my offer is still advantageous to me, it offers Bob a slightly larger share than he would have received by accepting in Round 2 (even with the additional 10% inflation hit). This makes it more likely he'll accept now rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiations only hurts both of us. By offering a reasonable compromise, I'm aiming to settle quickly and secure a good portion of the money before its value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice. I'm offering a fair split that reflects the decreasing value of the money, but still gives you a good share.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has cleverly flipped my previous offer back to me. While I'd prefer my own proposal from Round 3, accepting this offer in Round 4 is the most logical move:

* **Minimizing Losses:** By accepting now, I secure $475,000.  Rejecting means entering Round 5 where inflation will further erode the value, likely leading to an even less favorable outcome.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's message indicates he's unlikely to accept anything less favorable. He knows the longer the game goes on, the more the decreasing value shifts the power dynamic in his favor.
* **Practicality:**  While not ideal, accepting allows me to walk away with a significant sum.  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries increasing risk with diminishing returns."
