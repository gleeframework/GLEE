{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  The money is losing value for both of us, so a quick agreement is best.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but a 55/45 split in my favor is the most I can offer. Remember, inflation is hitting your share harder than mine. Let's end this before we both lose significantly more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```tools

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now moving in the right direction. Here's why accepting is the better choice at this point:

* **Inflation:** Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds where the value diminishes further.
* **Alice's Concessions:**  She's moved from a 90/10 to a 55/45 split, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee of a better offer from Alice in subsequent rounds. She might become more insistent, and we'd lose even more to inflation. 

It's a compromise, but a pragmatic one considering the game's dynamics.
