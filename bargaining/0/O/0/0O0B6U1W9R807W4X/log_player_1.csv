"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  The money is losing value for both of us, so a quick agreement is best. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
