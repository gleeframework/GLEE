"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60, leaving Bob with $40, and sends a message suggesting that this division is fair, despite taking a bit more for herself. The message aims to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I'd like a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation that affects only me, accepting $40 in the second round means I would actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal, keeping in mind that the money's value decreases for me with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose taking $55 and leaving Bob with $45. The message aims to explain that, due to the inflation affecting me, I need to adjust the offer to meet closer to the middle to make it fair for both of us. I'm trying to negotiate a better deal while still being reasonable and considering the impact of inflation on my gains."
