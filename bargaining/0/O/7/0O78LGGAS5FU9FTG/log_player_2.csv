Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation with each round. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. This offer is more than fair considering the risks we both face as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's clear we both want a larger share, but we need to reach an agreement before time runs out and we're left with nothing.  
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's final offer is better than what I might get in the remaining rounds given the inflation working against me.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting nothing at all."
