"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll start with a fair offer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equal.  I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so $4000 is actually worth $3200 to me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
