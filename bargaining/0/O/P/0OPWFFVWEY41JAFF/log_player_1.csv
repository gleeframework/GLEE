"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 (10,000 x 0.9). If we split it evenly, I would get $4,500 (5000 x 0.9).

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split considering the inflation.
