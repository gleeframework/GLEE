"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my generous offer, now it's my turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $80 in the first round is now equivalent to $64.

Bob's offer in the second round is $20 for me and $40 (not 80, which is 20% of 200) for him.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, my gain of $80 in the first round is now equivalent to $51.20 (80 * 0.8 * 0.8). 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. It's time to make a deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, and 20% less again in the third round, my gain of $80 in the first round is now equivalent to $51.20 * 0.8 = $40.96.

Considering the offer from Bob, I will accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
