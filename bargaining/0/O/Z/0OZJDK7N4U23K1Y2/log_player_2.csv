Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure what you're thinking, Bob, but I'm getting tired of this back and forth. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the pressure is on and inflation is eating into my potential gains, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Holding out a bit longer might push her to offer a more even split, especially since she expressed a desire to ""find a solution that works for both of us.""  I'm betting she'll be more generous in the next round."
