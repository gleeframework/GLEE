"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. We can both get a little more this way! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is now worth 80% of the initial 60 I was offered in Round 1, which is $48. And Bob's gain of 55 is now worth 95% of the initial 40 he was offered in Round 1, which is $38.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
