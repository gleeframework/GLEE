I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. I'm starting with a strong offer, hoping to secure the money quickly before inflation kicks in. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot less favorable than my initial proposal. I'm not willing to settle for a significantly smaller share, especially knowing inflation is hitting him harder. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit by offering Bob $2,000. This is still a pretty good deal for me, and it might be enough to entice him to accept before inflation eats away at his share further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit better than the previous round, it's still not enough to compensate for the risk of continuing to decline offers and potentially losing out on a large share due to inflation.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $7,500.  This should hopefully be attractive enough to Bob, considering inflation is hitting him much harder than me. The risk of him rejecting my offer again is still there, but I think this offer offers a good balance between securing a decent share and avoiding losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally getting closer to what I consider acceptable. With inflation hitting him so hard, I'm willing to accept this deal, which gives me a solid $7,000 and avoids the risk of us both getting nothing."
