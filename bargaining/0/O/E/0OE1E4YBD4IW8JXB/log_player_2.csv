Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate. This time I propose a 70/30 split. It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

```
Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer. The devaluation is hurting, but it's also affecting her willingness to be greedy.
