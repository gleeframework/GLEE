"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share, and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60% share. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're both starting from the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation affecting you more. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! 

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'd be gaining $4,000, but its value is actually $3,600 in real terms. I'm not sure I want to accept a 60/40 split, considering I'm effectively losing more value.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your offer, I think I can do better. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm gaining $4,500, which is worth $4,050 in real terms, and Bob would gain $5,500, which is worth $5,500 in real terms."
