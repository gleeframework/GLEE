"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the new offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is still a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but still a bit off""}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground and get closer to a more balanced split."
