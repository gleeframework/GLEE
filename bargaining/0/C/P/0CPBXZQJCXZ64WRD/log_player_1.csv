Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a standard ""ultimatum game"" approach.  I'm giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept, but I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation is starting to take effect.  A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the end."
