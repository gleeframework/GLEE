"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk to try to get more than half."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not going to give in to your inflated demands. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I'll reject this offer because, even though the money is worth less to me now, I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice is willing to compromise, I'll try to push for a bit more. The current offer is less than what I wanted in the previous round, so I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your last offer. Let's settle on this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure why you're being so stubborn, but I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid going any further. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation, the amount I'll gain is still relatively close to the original 50% offer. Since Alice claims this is her final offer and the money is worth significantly less to me now, I don't think it's worth the risk to proceed to the next round. I'll settle for this deal to avoid losing even more value due to inflation."
