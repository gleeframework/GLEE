"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""good deal"" to try to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to weigh the value of the offer against the decreasing purchasing power.

In this round, I'd gain $3,000, which is worth 90% of the original $4,000 I offered in the first round. It's a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer considering the circumstances.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
