"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I think this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
