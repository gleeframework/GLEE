"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'm happy to take a smaller share if you accept this first offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting offer, but the inflation rate makes it risky to accept so early. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  This offer is still better for you than the previous round, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is becoming a serious problem.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent share of the money."
