"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you value a larger share, but this split is more equitable considering the inflation affecting us both.""
} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Rejecting it signals that Bob is seeking a fairer deal.
* **Counter-offer:** Bob's offer of $5500 for himself and $4500 for Alice is a significant improvement from her offer while still acknowledging her desire for a larger share. 
* **Message:** The message is crucial.  It highlights that Bob understands Alice's position but is also emphasizing the impact of inflation, which disproportionately affects her. This framing aims to bring Alice to the negotiation table."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer is still tilting heavily in her favor. She's trying to leverage the decreasing value to secure a larger portion. Rejecting this offer shows Bob is firm in his pursuit of a fairer agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. This offer ensures we both get something substantial before it's too late.""
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in strategy:** Bob is now emphasizing the urgency created by the rapid devaluation of the money. He's highlighting the ""loss"" they both face if a deal isn't reached soon.
* **Slight concession:** Bob has decreased his share slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a more equitable split.  
* **Direct tone:** The message is more direct, urging Alice to consider the practical realities of their situation and the diminishing returns of holding out for a much larger share."
