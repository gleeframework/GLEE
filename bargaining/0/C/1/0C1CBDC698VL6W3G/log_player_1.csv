"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my $9,000 is now worth $8,100.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle this time, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a larger share.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my $8,100 is now worth $5,920.
