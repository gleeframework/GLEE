Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was a bit too greedy for me.  Let's be fair, this offer leaves us both with a decent share.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting us both. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day.

# Bob gain: 50

Even though it's an even split, accepting is the best option now. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is hitting me much harder than Bob.  Waiting any longer significantly reduces my potential gains.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might force Bob to offer even less in future rounds as the value of the money decreases for him too. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas continuing carries the risk of walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
