"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, keeping 90% for myself. Since we don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I want to maximize my gains in this first round. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that I'm losing out on a big chunk of the money, it's better to accept this offer. Inflation has already devalued the money, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing in the next round. It's a tough choice, but it's the most rational decision given the circumstances."
