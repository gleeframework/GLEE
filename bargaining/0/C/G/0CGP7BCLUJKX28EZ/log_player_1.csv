"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I think I deserve more for starting the negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer, and now he's trying to get a bigger share. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger share at my expense. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal, hoping that Bob will start to show some flexibility."
