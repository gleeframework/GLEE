"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""
}
```

Please relay this proposal to Bob. I'm looking forward to his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, but I'm willing to give you a bit more since I'll get the benefit of the next round's proposal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, and I think I can get a better deal. Besides, the difference in inflation rates between us might give me some leverage in the next rounds. \n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer, and I'll make a new proposal in Round 3.\n\n```python\n{\n  ""alice_gain"": 550000,\n  ""bob_gain"": 450000,\n  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""\n}\n```\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}\n\nPlease relay this proposal to Bob. Hopefully, he'll see the reason in meeting halfway, taking into account the inflation that's affecting us both (but me more so!)."
