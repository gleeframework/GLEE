"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be a bit more equitable. This way, we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the new offer, but I'll consider it.

I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
