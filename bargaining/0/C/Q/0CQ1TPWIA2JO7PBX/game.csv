,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be more realistic. I understand it's important to start fair, but we both lose if this drags on. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but your offer wasn't fair considering the inflation working against me. I'm proposing 56/44 – it's a compromise, and time is running out!",Alice,3,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're not accounting for how much we both lose as time goes on. I'm at 53/47 – meet me in the middle or we both lose out!",Alice,5,
