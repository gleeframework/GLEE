"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and straightforward division. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
