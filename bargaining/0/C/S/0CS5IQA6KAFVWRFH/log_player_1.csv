"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, knowing that the money will become less valuable for me with each passing round.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as he is not facing the same inflation issue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances."
