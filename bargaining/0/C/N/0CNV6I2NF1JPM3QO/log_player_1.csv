"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55/45 split is fair considering the risk of inflation. It gives us both a good share, and allows for some room to negotiate in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
