"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400k offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is trying to negotiate, I'll respond with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve more too""}

I'm proposing a slightly higher offer of 450k, which is still less than the original 500k I was hoping for, but more than Bob's initial offer."

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting 550k and Bob getting 450k. This is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a slight advantage."

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more too, but I'm not giving up yet""}
{""alice_gain"": 530000, ""bob_gain"": 470000}

I'm proposing a 53/47 split, with me getting 530k and Bob getting 470k. This is a slightly more generous offer than Bob's, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the remaining $1,000,000 evenly at 500k each."
