"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a fair counter-offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair counter-offer, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money being worth even less due to inflation.
