"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount in the first round to see how the game plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to give up 980,000 dollars easily. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share than his last offer, but still maintain a significant portion of the money for myself. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm going to keep fighting for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more significant share this time to show him that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  However, I still need to secure a sizable portion of the money.  The inflation is getting worse, and we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous.  He's clearly trying to exploit the inflation and take the majority of the money.  I'm not going to let him get away with it.  We're close to running out of time, but I'm still going to fight for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting hard.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split to see if Bob is finally willing to compromise.  We're both losing a lot of money with each passing round, so it's time to find a solution that benefits both of us."
