"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent share, but I think 400,000 is a fair amount for me considering the current value of money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
