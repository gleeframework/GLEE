Let's see what I can get!"

I'm going to offer Alice a bit less than she offered me, but I'm still being generous. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting a little more aggressive with the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split to last round, but increase my share slightly. Hopefully, the inflation will convince Alice to accept this time!"
