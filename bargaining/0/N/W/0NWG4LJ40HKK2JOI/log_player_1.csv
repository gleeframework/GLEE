"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you $400,000. You can try to do better next round if you want.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and I'm sure we can both agree that further rounds will only make the money less valuable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me $450,000 (500,000 * 0.9) and keeping $450,000 for himself. Considering the initial offer I made was 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob, this proposal seems more favorable to me.
