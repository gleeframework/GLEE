"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small share to get us going, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
