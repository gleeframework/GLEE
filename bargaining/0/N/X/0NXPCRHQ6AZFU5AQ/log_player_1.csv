Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but that offer was too low. Let's split the difference from your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a serious offer, Alice.  We're losing money by dragging this out.  Meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is better than my last offer and the difference is fairly small.  Bob's value is decreasing rapidly with each round, so there's a good chance he'll offer even less next time. It's time to take the deal and avoid further risk."
