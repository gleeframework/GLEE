"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. 60/40 split seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, I was hoping for a more balanced proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%."
