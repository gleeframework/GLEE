"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob! I'm not interested in getting only 1/9th of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see how he responds!"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I'm taking the majority of the prize. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offers are getting more and more one-sided! I'm not interested in getting only 1/5th of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, but also take into account that Bob has been trying to keep most of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving up. You can do better than this, right?""
}
```

I'm still taking a larger share, but I'm giving Bob a bit more than in my previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but don't get too excited, it's still a small amount for you. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! $50,000 for me is an insult. I'm not going to accept such a paltry sum. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal. This offer is not even worth considering."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, taking into account that Bob has been trying to lowball me. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking the majority, and you're getting a tiny fraction. Don't like it?""
}
```

I'm taking a huge share, leaving Bob with only 15% of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer or try to make another lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to nothing, but I'm giving you a tiny bit more. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is an absolute joke! $1,000 for me is an insult, and Bob is keeping 99.9% of the money. I'm not going to accept this ridiculous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal, even if it's my last chance."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a final, aggressive offer. I'll take the majority of the money, and Bob can have a tiny fraction. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm leaving Bob with only 10% of the money, and I'm taking the rest. If he rejects this offer, I'll be left with nothing, and we'll both walk away with zero."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, and I'm taking almost everything. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a ridiculous offer! $1 for me is laughable, and Bob is keeping 99.999% of the money. I'm not going to accept this insult. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll never accept an offer that leaves me with such a tiny fraction of the money. This is getting ridiculous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a last-ditch effort to salvage something from this negotiation. I'll take a smaller share, but at least I'll get a bit more than $1. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a small share, but I'm not going down without a fight. Don't think you can just bully me into nothing.""
}
```

I'm taking 20% of the money, leaving Bob with 80%. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting $1 or nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take the last dollar or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final insult. I've had enough of Bob's ridiculous offers. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with only $1. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this humiliating offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Since I've rejected this offer, we've reached the end of the 12 rounds. According to the rules, we both get nothing. Well, I guess I'll just have to start looking for a new deal elsewhere!"
