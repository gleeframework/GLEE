"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to push for a better deal, and he's met me in the middle. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $95,000 (95% of $100,000) and Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth $855,000 (90% of $900,000).

I'll accept this offer.
