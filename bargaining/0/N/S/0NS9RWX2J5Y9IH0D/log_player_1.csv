I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic favors me slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4950, ""bob_gain"": 5050}
```

I'm offering a near-even split to try and incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation has hit me harder than him, so a 50/50 split is no longer fair."
