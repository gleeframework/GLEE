"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a fair split, don't be greedy!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
Bob's gain: 600000 (no change)

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather get a higher share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 30% of the original amount, and Bob will get 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 48.8% reduction in Alice's gain:

Alice's gain: 450000 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 232220 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 550000 (no change)

I'll reject this offer since the actual amount I'd get is less than what I proposed in round 3. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 25% of the original amount, and Bob will get 75%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's make a deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 67.23% reduction in Alice's gain:

Alice's gain: 500000 * 0.3299 (1 - 0.6701) = 165495 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 500000 (no change)

I'll reject this offer since the actual amount I'd get is less than what I proposed in round 5, and it's not a good deal considering the significant reduction in value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
