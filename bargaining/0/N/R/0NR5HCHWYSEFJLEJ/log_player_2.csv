Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet closer to the middle, 57-43 is a better split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us, especially her.  It's still beneficial to hold out for a better offer."
