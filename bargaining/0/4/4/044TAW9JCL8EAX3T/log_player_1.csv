"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer is a bit aggressive, but it maximizes my share in the first round.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation significantly lowers the value of the money if we go another round.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, even though it's much less than my initial goal."
