"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is better than getting nothing in 12 rounds, there's a chance I can get a better deal.  I'll see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm betting Alice is more concerned about getting something than about getting a big share. If she rejects this, we'll see how much she values getting something at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my share and ensuring Alice has a reason to accept. We're approaching the halfway point, so I'm increasing my offer slightly but keeping it at a significant difference.  Hopefully, Alice will recognize the value of getting something before it's too late."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation.  This offer, while not ideal, is a good compromise.  It's a fair split, and it ensures we both get something.  Time is running out, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
