I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can do better than this.  Inflation is a real concern, and I'm losing 20% of my potential gains with each round. Accepting this offer at least secures a significant portion of the money."
