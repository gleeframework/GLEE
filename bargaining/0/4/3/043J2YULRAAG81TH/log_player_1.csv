"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
