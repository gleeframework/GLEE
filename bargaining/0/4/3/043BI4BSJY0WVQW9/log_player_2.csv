Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and her potential gains decrease.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting I can push her further in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Don't let greed make us both losers.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split now for a few reasons:

* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting on both of us. 
* **Alice's desperation:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for her, indicating she's feeling the heat of the diminishing returns.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and appealing to her sense of fairness might be the best strategy at this point. 

By framing this offer as a win-win to avoid a lose-lose situation, I'm hoping Alice will see the value in accepting a fair deal before it's too late."
