I propose to take 900,000$ and leave 100,000$ for Bob.  This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while ensuring that I get the majority of the money. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!  While it's true that the money is worth less now, his offer is far too unbalanced. I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to try to be a bit more flexible with my offer, but I still want to make sure I get a fair share.  I'm going to offer Bob 400,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer, but still leaves me with a comfortable 600,000. Let's see if this is more appealing."
