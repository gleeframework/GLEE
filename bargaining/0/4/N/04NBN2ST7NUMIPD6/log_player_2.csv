"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally, I get a bit more since I proposed second.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, the money is losing value for you, let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""The money is losing value for both of us, let's split it equally and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous with 40, take it before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing rapidly, accepting $40 now is a significant loss compared to the potential of a better deal in the next few rounds. Alice knows the pressure is on and is trying to lowball. I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to try and secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a slight loss due to inflation, but I need a better deal than that. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is killing your share, take this or leave it 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The game has reached a critical point. Accepting a $38 payout, while far from ideal, is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better, and the value of my share will only continue to plummet."
