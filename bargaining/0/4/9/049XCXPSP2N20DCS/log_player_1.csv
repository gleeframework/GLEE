"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and take 60% for me, 40% for you""}\n\n###\n\nI have proposed a division of $1,000,000, where I take 60% ($600,000) and Bob takes 40% ($400,000). The message I attached is ""Let's be fair and take 60% for me, 40% for you"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer if I get 60% since you took 60% last time. Let's be fair and even. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, and I initially offered Bob 40% ($400,000), I see no reason to accept the same amount when I was initially aiming for 60% ($600,000). The fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less due to inflation does not directly impact my decision, as my gain remains constant in value.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal for dividing the $1,000,000.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet closer to the middle, 55% for me and 45% for you.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI have already sent my new proposal for dividing the $1,000,000 at the end of my previous response. Here it is again for clarity:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet closer to the middle, 55% for me and 45% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer is an attempt to find a middle ground, acknowledging Bob's desire for a larger share while still prioritizing my initial aim for a larger portion of the money. Given the effects of inflation on Bob's share, I'm slightly more aggressive with my offer, but still open to negotiation."
