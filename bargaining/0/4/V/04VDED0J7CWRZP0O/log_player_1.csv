"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a reasonable and fair split to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more equitable.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 55-45 split is fair, especially considering the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 58-42 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm offering 58% to myself and 42% to Bob, hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise."
