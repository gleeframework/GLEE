"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose to take 95 dollars and give 5 dollars to Bob. This way, I secure most of the money and leave Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 90 dollars for myself and 10 for Bob. Since Bob rejected my last offer, I want to show I'm willing to compromise while still getting the majority share. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, especially as the value of money continues to decrease."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though Bob's offer is more generous than in Round 2, the value of my share has decreased due to inflation. I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to keep pushing for a larger share, as the game progresses and the value of money drops further."

Round 5

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but at a smaller pace. I'm offering 85 dollars for myself and 15 for Bob.  I'm trying to find a balance between securing a good share for myself and making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept.  We're nearing the middle of the game, so the pressure is on."

With just two rounds remaining, I'm making one final attempt to secure a decent share. I'm offering 70 dollars for myself and 30 for Bob.
