"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough. I was hoping for a better split, considering we have 11 more rounds to go. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Since we're already at the midpoint, I'm willing to accept this offer and split the remaining $10,000 equally between us."
