"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 4000. I'd be better off accepting this offer.
