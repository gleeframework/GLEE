"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can wrap it up!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. This way, we can both get a decent share and avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth 48$ (60 * 0.8) and Bob's gain of 40 is still worth 40$. Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 48$ and call it a day!"
