Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. I want to see if he'll accept this in the first round, or if he's willing to risk losing money to try and get a better deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation affecting Bob, but still holding out for a large portion.  I believe this offer is fair and leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck!  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation by offering me a significantly lower amount than he did in the first round. I'm not going to let him get away with it - I'm still holding out for a more reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise again, but I'm still trying to secure a majority of the money. I believe that a 70/30 split is fair, considering Bob's losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy, and I'm not willing to let him exploit the inflation to that extent.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share slightly to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money. I believe this offer is fair and leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to avoid further losses."
