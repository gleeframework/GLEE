950000.0,50000.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm willing to budge a little. But I'm still the one with the most to gain here. This is my final offer. Accept it and we're done. Reject it, and the value of the money keeps dropping for me, so I'll be even less likely to share in the future.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This is a fairer split considering the inflation, and we can both still walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,4,

900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned about the dwindling value.  I'm offering you a decent chunk of the money. This is my last offer before the money becomes even less worthwhile for me. Accept it, or we both risk losing out.",Alice,5,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice,  we are both losing money with each passing round.  Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor, which is a significant amount for you considering the inflation.  This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both risk getting nothing.",Bob,6,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but this is my final offer.  If you reject it, the value of the money for me continues to plummet, and I might not be able to offer you anything in the next round.  Think about it carefully.",Alice,7,

200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the end.  This is my final offer -  800,000 for me and 200,000 for you.  It's a good deal considering the inflation, and it's a chance for us both to get something rather than nothing.  Let's not let our greed get the better of us.",Bob,8,

800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, I'm desperate now. The inflation is killing me, but I'm still willing to share, even though it's less than I wanted. This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both get nothing. Think about it.",Alice,9,
