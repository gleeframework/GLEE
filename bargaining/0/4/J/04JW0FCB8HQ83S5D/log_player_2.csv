# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but this is my final offer.  If you reject it, the value of the money for me continues to plummet, and I might not be able to offer you anything in the next round.  Think about it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than before, it's still not fair considering the significant inflation we're facing. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, and I believe I can get a better deal for myself. I'm going to hold out for a more equitable split."

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the end.  This is my final offer -  800,000 for me and 200,000 for you.  It's a good deal considering the inflation, and it's a chance for us both to get something rather than nothing.  Let's not let our greed get the better of us.""}

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is making Alice's offer increasingly appealing.  This is a significant sum of money for me, and it's better than nothing.  I accept Alice's offer."
