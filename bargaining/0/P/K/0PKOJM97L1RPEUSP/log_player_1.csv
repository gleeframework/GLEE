"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can negotiate further in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and see if we can do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll consider it a fair proposal. I accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
