"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob $40 and take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. Since the offer is 50/50, it's a fair split, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with less value in my money due to inflation. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
