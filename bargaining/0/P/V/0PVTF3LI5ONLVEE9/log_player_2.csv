Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to split it closer to 60/40. This accounts for the inflation, and we can still both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
