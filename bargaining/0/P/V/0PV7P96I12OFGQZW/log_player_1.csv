"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get half.  Accept this, and we'll both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I now have $900,000 - 10% = $810,000.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not convinced that we should both get exactly half. I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Half is too generous for me. I'll give you 400,000, and I'll take 600,000. It's a better deal for me.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, I now have $810,000 - 10% = $729,000.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep the majority. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share this time.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I now have $729,000 - 27.1% = $530,070.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think I can do better than that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob. I'll give you 320,000, and I'll take 680,000. It's a fair compromise.""
}

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I now have $476,463 - 40.95% = $282,177.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think this is a relatively fair split, and I'm running out of time to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. You've worn me down. I accept your offer. Let's split it 55/45 and be done with it.""
