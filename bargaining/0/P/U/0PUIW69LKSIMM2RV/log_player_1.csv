  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"

# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good start, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Can you do better, Bob?""
