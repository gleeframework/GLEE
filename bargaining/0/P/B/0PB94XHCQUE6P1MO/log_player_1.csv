Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right that inflation is hitting me harder, accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant chunk of the initial amount. It's better to hold out for a slightly better offer, as Bob knows the longer the game goes on, the more I'm incentivized to accept any deal."
