"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a bold move, but I want to see how he reacts and if he's willing to risk getting nothing by rejecting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair offer. I'm not sure why Bob would have rejected my previous proposal, but  I'm happy to accept this and move on."
