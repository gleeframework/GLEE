"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable start. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values. 

In this round, I'll get $45, which is 20% less than the $60 I could have gotten in the first round. Bob will get $55, which is 10% less than the $60 he could have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not sure if I can do better, I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
