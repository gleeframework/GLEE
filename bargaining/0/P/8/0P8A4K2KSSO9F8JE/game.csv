4000.0,6000.0,Your turn Alice! How about a 60/40 split? It's important to find a balance since the money loses value quickly for both of us.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 55/45. We need to reach an agreement soon before the value drops further.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,Time is running out! 58/42 seems fair considering the inflation rate working against us. Let's close this deal.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50 seems the fairest option now.,Alice,5,
