7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the diminishing value of money for both of us. This offer ensures a greater gain for you, Alice, than the previous round's 25% while still providing me with a significant share. Let's end this game on a positive note.",Bob,2,
