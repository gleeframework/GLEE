"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the diminishing value of money for both of us. This offer ensures a greater gain for you, Alice, than the previous round's 25% while still providing me with a significant share. Let's end this game on a positive note. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
