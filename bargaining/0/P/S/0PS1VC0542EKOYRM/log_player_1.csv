"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can still negotiate further if you want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","You think I was too generous in round 1, huh? Well, I'm not going to make the same mistake again.

I'll reject your offer. The money is worth less now, and I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer, but I'll be more cautious this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you all the power. I'll take 420k, and you can have 580k. It's a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
