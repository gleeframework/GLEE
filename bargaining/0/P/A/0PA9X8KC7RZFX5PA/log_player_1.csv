"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a more even split, but I'm not giving up that much. Your turn again!""
