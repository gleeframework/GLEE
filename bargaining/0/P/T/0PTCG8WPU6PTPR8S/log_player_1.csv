"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, so I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the value of my gain is still decreasing. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a higher share, but not too high, since I don't know how much Bob values his gain.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
