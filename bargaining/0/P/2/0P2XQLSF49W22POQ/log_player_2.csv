"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, how about a 60/40 split? I think that's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a different split in the next round. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice started with a 60/40 split, I'll try to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation factor for both of us. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, how about we do a 55/45 split? It's closer to the middle and accounts for the loss in value over rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  With inflation, a 50/50 split makes the most sense. It's fair and avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept the 50/50 split. Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's offer is now more favorable due to the decreasing value of the money, it's reasonable to accept this offer and end the game here."
