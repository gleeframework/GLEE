"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 50$ in this round is equivalent to 40$ in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 50$ is equivalent to 19$ in the first round, but I'll assume it's the same for him.

In this case, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, and I'm willing to accept it.
