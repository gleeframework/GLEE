"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60/40 in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to meet in the middle. That's a reasonable proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the money 50/50. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
