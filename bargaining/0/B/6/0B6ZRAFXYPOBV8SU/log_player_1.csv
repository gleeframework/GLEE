"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90-10 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 90-10 split, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer and Bob is now trying to flip the script. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
