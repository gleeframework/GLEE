I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal. I figure he'll be happy with a thousand bucks, and I'll have the majority.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'm unhappy about the 5% inflation hit, I'm still getting half of the money with this offer.  It's better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to further inflation. Let's take it!"
