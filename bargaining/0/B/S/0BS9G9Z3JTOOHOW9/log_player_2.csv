"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While an even split seems fair on the surface, Alice gets significantly more money in this scenario due to the different inflation rates. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the different inflation rates. Let's agree and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Let's ensure both of us receive a fair amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still think I could get a better deal, the inflation is significantly impacting both of us. An even split at this point is the most sensible option to ensure we both get something."
