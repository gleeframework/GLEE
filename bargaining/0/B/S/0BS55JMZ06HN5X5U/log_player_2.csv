"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  We'll see if she'll be more generous, or if she'll take advantage of the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a bit more fair. Let's work together to make this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest.  It's the only way to guarantee we both get something in this game with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. A 50/50 split is fair and guarantees I get something."
