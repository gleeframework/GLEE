"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a chance, I'll give you a better deal next round if you don't accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53.

I'm not sure if Bob is bluffing or not, but I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a worse deal next round. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
