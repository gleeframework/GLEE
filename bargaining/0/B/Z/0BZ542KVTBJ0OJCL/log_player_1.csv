"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial generosity.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'm not giving up that much.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $100,000, especially considering the money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting it all, Bob. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a more balanced offer, but I'm still trying to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to squeeze out a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for an even better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away that easily, Bob! I'll try to push you even harder.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $450,000, especially considering the money is worth 48.8% less than it was in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Meet me at the 55/45 split!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm trying to get closer to the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice, but I'm not going to back down 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

I'll reject this offer and try to hold out for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think I'm desperate? I'm just getting started, Bob!""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $300,000, especially considering the money is worth 67.23% less than it was in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 75.66% less than in the first round, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. 50/50 split, no more games!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest deal considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm trying to end the game on a high note and avoid losing more value due to inflation."
