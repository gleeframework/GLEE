"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. It's worth seeing what kind of offer Alice makes under pressure as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. Let's speed things up. This offer favors me, but it's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Advantage:**  The longer the game goes, the more I benefit from the difference in inflation rates. Alice's money loses value faster.
* **Stronger Position:** By Round 2, Alice can see I'm serious about waiting for a better deal. My offer is slanted in my favor, but still reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid greater losses later. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message creates urgency.  Even if she rejects this offer, it might make her more willing to accept a smaller gain in a future round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to secure a significant advantage. While her offer is closer to a compromise, I'm confident I can secure a better deal as the game progresses. Each round that passes significantly weakens her position while strengthening mine.  I'm willing to play the long game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at the pot. I'm holding firm on this offer. Take it or leave it – your choice.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Power:** By Round 4, the inflation difference has significantly eroded Alice's bargaining power.  It's time to push for a deal that heavily favors me.
* **Calculated Risk:**  A 60/40 split is aggressive, but the implied threat of walking away with nothing might be enough to sway Alice into accepting.  
* **Time Pressure:** The message reinforces the urgency of the situation.  Every round makes the total pot less appealing, and Alice is acutely aware of that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation affects me more; let's rebalance 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation difference as leverage, but her offer is still not favorable enough. She's acknowledging the shrinking pot but not fully conceding to a deal that reflects the new reality.  I need to hold firm and wait for a better offer. The pressure is mounting on her, and time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get, given the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By Round 6, it's crucial to establish a non-negotiable position. Increasing my demand slightly shows I'm serious about my advantage.
* **Finality:**  The message clearly states this is my last offer, putting the decision squarely in Alice's court.  
* **Time Sensitivity:**   With the remaining rounds dwindling, Alice is under immense pressure to accept a deal, even if it heavily favors me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a fair deal before I take a risk 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Here's why:

* **Alice is Bluffing (Probably):**  Her ""last chance"" warning is likely a tactic to scare me into accepting a less favorable offer. She knows we both lose everything if no deal is reached. 
* **Time is Still a Factor:** While the pressure is on, we still have five rounds left. The longer Alice waits, the worse her position becomes. My losses from inflation are significantly less than hers.
* **Holding Firm:** I've established a pattern of rejecting offers that don't meet my requirements. Changing my approach now could signal weakness and encourage Alice to push for an even smaller share in later rounds.

I'm betting that Alice will crack under pressure and offer a larger share in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. Take it or leave it.  The next offer will be even less in your favor.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  With time running out, it's time for a final, aggressive push. Increasing my share again emphasizes the strength of my position. 
* **No More Games:** The message is blunt and to the point. There's no room for misinterpretation – accept this deal or face a worse one. 
* **Credible Threat:**  Alice knows I'm willing to walk away with nothing. The threat of a smaller share in the next round is believable and designed to force her hand.

This is a high-stakes gamble, but given the rapidly shrinking pot and Alice's increasingly desperate position, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is severe; meet me halfway to avoid losing everything 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Shifting Tides:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is significantly closer to a 50/50 split than her previous proposals. The severe inflation is taking its toll, and even a slight advantage for Alice is better than losing everything if we fail to reach an agreement. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With only three rounds remaining, the potential gains from holding out are shrinking rapidly alongside the total pot.  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk that Alice might dig in her heels and offer even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds, potentially leading to a stalemate and zero gain for both of us. 

* **Time is Running Out:** The ""losing everything"" message isn't an exaggeration.  I need to be realistic about the situation. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share of the diminished pot. 

While I'm confident I could have secured a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, the game's dynamics have shifted. It's time to cut my losses, secure a win, and avoid the catastrophic outcome of walking away with nothing."
