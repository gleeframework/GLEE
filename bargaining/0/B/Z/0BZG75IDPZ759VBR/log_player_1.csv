"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" aims to convey a sense of cooperation and reasonableness, as the division is slightly in my favor but still offers Bob a substantial amount. This approach may encourage Bob to accept the offer, considering the looming threat of inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's speed things up. This offer favors me, but it's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer takes into account the effects of inflation, accepting $4500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round due to the 10% decrease in value for me. Additionally, the game is still in its early stages, and I believe there's room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that might better reflect the value I'm looking for, considering the inflationary impact on both of our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. The message aims to acknowledge the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains and suggests finding a compromise. Given that Bob's previous offer gave me $4500, which I rejected, I'm trying to find a middle ground that slightly adjusts the amounts in my favor while still being mindful of Bob's expectations and the decreasing value of the money. This approach shows that I'm willing to negotiate and adapt to the changing circumstances of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at the pot. I'm holding firm on this offer. Take it or leave it â€“ your choice. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the impact of inflation, accepting $4000 in the fourth round means I'd be getting significantly less value than I would have in the first round due to the 27.1% decrease in value for me. Bob's offer doesn't seem to adequately account for this disparity, as they're holding firm on a division that increasingly favors them due to the differing inflation rates affecting our gains. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating for a more equitable division in the next round, despite the mounting pressure from inflation and the limited number of rounds remaining."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation affects me more; let's rebalance""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4400 and keep $5600 for myself. The message highlights the uneven impact of inflation on our potential gains, with my share being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, compared to Bob's 14.26% decrease. By pointing out this disparity, I aim to justify a division that slightly favors me, as I'm being more heavily penalized by the inflation mechanism. This approach seeks to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, encouraging them to accept a compromise that takes into account the different effects of inflation on our outcomes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although Bob frames this as their ""final offer"" and emphasizes the time pressure, accepting $3800 in the sixth round would mean I'd be getting substantially less value than I would have in the first round due to the 40.95% decrease in value for me. The gap in the impact of inflation on our gains continues to widen, and Bob's offer doesn't sufficiently compensate for this disparity. Given that we're only halfway through the available rounds, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a more equitable division in the next round, despite Bob's assertion that this is their ""final offer."""
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal before I take a risk""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4600 and keep $5400 for myself. The message conveys that I'm willing to make one more attempt at a reasonable compromise before I might change my strategy to account for the drastic impact of inflation on my potential gains. By framing this as a ""last chance,"" I aim to pressure Bob into considering the offer more seriously, as the next rounds will likely see me taking a more aggressive stance to mitigate my losses due to inflation. This approach seeks to balance the urgency of the situation with the appeal of a relatively fair division, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. Take it or leave it.  The next offer will be even less in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's insistence that this is their final reasonable offer and that subsequent offers will be less favorable, accepting $3600 in the eighth round means I'd be getting significantly less value than I would have in the first round due to the 52.17% decrease in value for me. The difference in how inflation affects our gains continues to grow, and Bob's offer does not adequately address this imbalance. With four rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiations or even potentially walking away with nothing rather than accepting an offer that I perceive as unfair given the circumstances. Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain pressure on Bob and potentially force a more equitable division in the next rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Inflation is severe; meet me halfway to avoid losing everything""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4800 and keep $5200 for myself. The message emphasizes the drastic impact of inflation on both our potential gains and the looming threat of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I aim to appeal to Bob's rational self-interest, as the alternative to finding a compromise is a significant risk of both of us losing everything. This approach seeks to balance the urgency of the situation with a division that, while slightly favoring me, still offers Bob a substantial amount, considering the circumstances. The goal is to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is preferable to the uncertainty and potential loss that awaits if we continue to negotiate or reach the end of the game without an agreement."
