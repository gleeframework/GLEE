"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... It seems like he's trying to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give him 80% of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again! Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Bob's offer seems even more skewed in his favor than before. I'll think carefully about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 19.23% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and Bob's offers are getting more aggressive!

However, I think I'll take a closer look at this offer... 40% for me and 60% for Bob seems like a decent compromise, considering the situation.
