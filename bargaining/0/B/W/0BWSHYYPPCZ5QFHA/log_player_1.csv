"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to be strategic about my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to take that into account. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $4,000, which is worth the same as $5,000 in the first round, but Bob will be getting $6,000, which is worth $7,600 in the first round.

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still relatively close to the initial 50/50 split. Let's see how Bob reacts!"

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of Bob's gain in the first round. Bob's gain of $4,800 in this round is worth approximately $7,800 in the first round.
