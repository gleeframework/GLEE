"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars, leaving Bob with 20 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor that will reduce the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor kicking in, the money is becoming less valuable by the minute!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I'll accept it. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise, given the circumstances.
