"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40, which is a relatively even split. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's go with 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain would be 60 * 0.8 = 48.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll analyze it:

* Alice gain: 45
* Bob gain: 55

I think this is a good compromise, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it even more balanced. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I like the idea of a more balanced split, but how about 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain would be 48 * 0.8 = 38.4.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50/50 is a fair split.""
}
```"
