"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to find a balance between being generous enough to encourage acceptance and not giving away too much. The impact of inflation is also a consideration, but at this stage, the effect is not drastic, so I'm focusing more on finding a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the impact of inflation, I believe the proposed split is not favorable enough for me. In the first round, I offered Bob $400,000, and now, even with the 10% decrease in value for him, he's offering me less than what I initially proposed for myself. Considering we have 10 more rounds and the inflation will continue to affect the value, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of negotiating a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm considering the impact of inflation on both of us. The money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the initial round. Given Bob's previous offer and his willingness to give me less than what I initially proposed for myself, I'm adjusting my strategy to make a more favorable offer to him while still trying to maximize my gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\nThis offer slightly reduces what I'm willing to take compared to the first round, acknowledging the decrease in value due to inflation, and gives Bob a bit more, in hopes that he will see it as a compromise and accept, considering the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""."
