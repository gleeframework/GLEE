Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's a decent starting offer, I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Let's see if Alice is willing to go for a more even split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still not as good as the first round. I will keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'll increase my offer slightly, hoping Alice will see the value in settling before the inflation further reduces her gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'd gain, Alice's offer is still better than my last proposal, and there's no guarantee that I can get a better deal in the following rounds. It's time to secure a win."
