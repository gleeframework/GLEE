"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer in Round 1 was equivalent to 60% of the original amount, but now it's worth 10% less, so I'd be getting 54% of the original amount. Bob's offer in Round 2 is 50% of the original amount, which is worth 20% less for him, so he'd be getting 40% of the original amount.

Since Bob's offer is more favorable to him, but I'd be getting a slightly smaller share than I would have in Round 1, I'll decide to reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to Round 1. Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 45%."
