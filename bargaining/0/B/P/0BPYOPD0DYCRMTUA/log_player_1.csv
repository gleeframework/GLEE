Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a fairer deal considering the inflation rates, and it gives you a chance to avoid further losses in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
