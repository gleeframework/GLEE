"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on me!

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting 40, that's 40% of the original $100, which is worth 40 * 0.8 = $32 after inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
