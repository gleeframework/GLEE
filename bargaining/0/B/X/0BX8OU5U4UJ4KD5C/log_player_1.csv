"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I will receive $600,000 and Bob will receive $400,000. I also included a message to Bob, ""Let's be fair"". Let's see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's work together to reach a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!



Also, I'll make sure to take into account the inflation when making my next offer. The money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI will make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I will adjust my proposal to reflect this.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I am willing to accept $570,000, which is less than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I am also offering Bob $430,000, which is more than my initial offer to him. My message to Bob is ""Let's meet in the middle"", indicating that I am willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer!"
