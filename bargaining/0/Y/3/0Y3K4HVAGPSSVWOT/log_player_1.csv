"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can do better for both of us.  Let's flip the script, and see how you like a 95/5 split in my favor.  Remember, inflation is a fickle beast! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
