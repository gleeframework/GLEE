"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $1,000,  it's early in the game, and with inflation, the value of that $1,000 could significantly decrease in later rounds. It's better to see what Alice proposes in the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get the same amount, and we can move on to other things. ""}
