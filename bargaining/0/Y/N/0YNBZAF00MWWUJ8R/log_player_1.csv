"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm willing to be generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 4750.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gain! My share of 3000 is now worth only 86.74% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 4341.20.
