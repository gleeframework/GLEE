I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a more even split, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in round 3!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm going to try and get a little more than last time. 8000 for me, 2000 for Bob. Let's see if this is more appealing!"

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I'm not sure if he'll be able to make a better offer in the next round.  Let's see what happens."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's losing more and more value with each passing round, and will accept this offer to secure something."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is starting to hurt Bob more, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to try and hold out for a few more rounds to see if I can secure a larger share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
``` 

I'm going to make one last attempt at getting a good deal. This time, I'm offering 6000 for myself and 4000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept before the inflation eats away at his potential gains even more."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  With only a few rounds left, I think it's the most reasonable solution. If Bob rejects this, we're both risking getting nothing at all."
