70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you get $30. It's a good deal for you in the first round considering the inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, my turn. I understand the inflation is a factor, so let's be more realistic. I propose 60/40, it's a fair deal considering the money will be worth less next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be practical.  My offer is still better for you than waiting any longer.  I'll take $65, and you get $35 before it shrinks even further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking!  Let's split 55/45 and call it a day.  Each round is costing us both money.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer - $40 is better than nothing, and that's what we'll both end up with if we don't compromise soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. It's clear we both lose out if this goes on much longer. Let's split it 50/50 right now and call it a day.",Bob,6,
