"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, with a slight advantage for me to start. This seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation.  As Bob, I'm not losing any value on my money in this round, but Alice is losing 10% of the value. I'll hold out and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I need more than 40% considering the inflation we're facing. Let's split the money closer to 55/45 in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the inflation I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Alice is offering a larger share for me this round, the inflation is still working in my favor. I'll hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the halfway point, and the inflation is only going to get worse for you. I'm willing to offer you 40% this time, but I'm not going to budge much further.  Let's make a deal before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more time wasted and we'll both lose out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to continue pushing for a larger share, the inflation is starting to hit Alice hard. Accepting an even split now ensures that we both get something, and it avoids the risk of losing everything in the later rounds."
