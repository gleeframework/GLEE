"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to offer something similar, but with a slight twist. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my previous offer was actually a good one, but Alice rejected it. Now, Alice is offering 40/60, which is a bit more favorable to me. I'll consider it, but I'll still try to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. However, I don't want to risk getting rejected again. So, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
