```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game off to a good start and set a fair tone for the negotiations."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal after rejecting my initial offer.

I'm not willing to give him a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.
