"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems generous at first glance, Alice's share is significantly larger. Considering the steep inflation rate for both of us, waiting her out is advantageous. I believe I can secure a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation hurts you more than me. I propose a more even split that benefits us both in the long run.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Given the accelerating inflation, she's feeling the pressure more than I am. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. My offer is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I won't go below 50%. Inflation or not, I deserve a fair share 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice calling 52% ""halfway"" is rich, considering the initial disparity in our inflation rates.  While tempting, I think her resolve is weakening faster than mine. A couple more rounds and she'll be significantly more amenable to a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing second. Take my offer â€“ you'll still get a significant sum, and we can finally be done with this."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fine, 50/50. I've compromised as much as I can. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally dawned on Alice that clinging to an advantageous split is pointless when inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the whole pie. Accepting the 50/50 offer now is the most logical choice."
