"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a good starting point. It's smart to reject and see if Alice will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's be fair.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's tempting to continue negotiating, considering the inflation rates, accepting this offer is the best option. Alice's offer is relatively fair, and continuing to reject risks losing even more money due to the increasing inflation."
