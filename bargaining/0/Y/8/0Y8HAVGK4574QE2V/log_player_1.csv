Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a tempting starting point, Alice. However, I believe a slightly more balanced division is in order considering the inflation we're facing. Let's make this deal and walk away with a fair share each. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
