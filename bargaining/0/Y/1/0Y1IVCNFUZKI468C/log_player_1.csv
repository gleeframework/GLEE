"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI offer a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's divide fairly"". This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm giving Bob a significant share while also taking into account my own interests. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, implying that this is a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's be reasonable and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the message tries to persuade me to accept by framing it as ""reasonable"" and warning of further rounds, I recognize that this is actually a worse deal for me than my initial proposal. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I have no incentive to accept a less favorable split. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal or wait for Bob to concede due to the increasing effects of inflation on his share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costing you, let's settle""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my share to 60% and decrease Bob's share to 40%. My message highlights the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. By framing it as ""let's settle,"" I'm also implying that this is a reasonable compromise, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. We're both losing money with each round, and this is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I reject Bob's offer. Despite the message's appeal to fairness and the suggestion that we're both losing money, I recognize that the inflation affects Bob's share more significantly than mine. In reality, I'm not losing any value, while Bob is. Given this advantage, I see no reason to accept an equal split, especially when I've already made more favorable offers. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming for a better deal as Bob's share continues to devalue.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, accept before it's too late""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my share to 65% and decrease Bob's share to 35%. My message emphasizes the mounting impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, aiming to create a greater sense of urgency. By suggesting that he should accept before it's too late, I'm trying to persuade Bob that further rounds will only result in a worse deal for him, making this offer more appealing by comparison. I'm taking advantage of the fact that inflation continues to devalue Bob's share, while mine remains unaffected."
