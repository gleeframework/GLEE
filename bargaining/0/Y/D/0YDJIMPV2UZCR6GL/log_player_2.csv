It's painful, but at this point, accepting is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, the value of Bob's share plummets. He's now losing 83.22% of the value compared to the initial rounds. Waiting any longer is financial suicide.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice has shown no willingness to budge towards a fairer deal.  It's highly unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better split in the remaining rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $250,000 is far from ideal, it's much better than the $0 Bob will get if he continues to reject offers and the rounds run out. 

This highlights the power dynamic in negotiations where one party is immune to a changing environment. It forces the other party to make increasingly desperate decisions."
