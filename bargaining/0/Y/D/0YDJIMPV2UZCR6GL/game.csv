450000.0,550000.0,"I understand you wanting a larger share, but I'm feeling the inflation pressure already.  This offer is more reflective of the diminishing returns.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Considering the inflation, you should be more eager to accept this offer.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to a point where the inflation makes this pointless for me.  I'm offering a slightly better deal than before, but this is as high as I can go.",Bob,4,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I'm serious.  The inflation means every round is a losing proposition for me.  This is absolutely my final offer - take it before the clock runs out on both of us.",Bob,8,
