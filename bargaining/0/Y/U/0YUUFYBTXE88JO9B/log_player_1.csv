"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $5,000, which is more than Bob's offer of $4,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up my advantage!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I'm not willing to give up my advantage, I'll make a new offer that still favors me, but not as much as before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but don't get too excited!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too kind, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, his offer is actually a better deal for him than it seems at first glance. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since I'm still getting $5,000, which is more than Bob's offer of $4,200, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal than you think, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that's even more favorable to me, given the inflation rate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more generous than you think I am!""
}
