"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the inflation is a factor, but I need to look out for myself too. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 55/45 split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly 50/50.  It's the fairest option and avoids further losses from inflation.""}
