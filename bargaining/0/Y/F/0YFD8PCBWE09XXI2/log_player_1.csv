"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair at the start of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less in Round 2, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to Round 3 and losing even more value.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now. Since I'm trying to maximize my gain, I'll consider Bob's offer. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now. To compensate for the loss in value, I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60/40 split, which seems more favorable to me considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. Bob's offer is a 52/48 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer, but still not as favorable to me as I'd like.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now. I need to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a 70/30 split, which is a more significant advantage, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a significant fraction of its original value now. Bob's offer is a 48/52 split, which is actually closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think this might be the best option.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
