"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise with a 2:1 ratio. I'll take 4000 and you'll get 6000. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
