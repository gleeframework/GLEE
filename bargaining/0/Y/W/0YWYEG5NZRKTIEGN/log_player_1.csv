"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this time. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'm not thrilled about giving up 32 dollars, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
