"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the 100$ and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both need to account for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's offer, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
