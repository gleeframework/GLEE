Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the higher inflation rate you face. This allows us both to get a good amount while acknowledging the urgency of your situation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, Bob, I think we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see what the next round brings."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is working against me, but not THAT much:** While inflation is hitting Alice harder, waiting one more round might result in a better offer than a 60/40 split in Bob's favor.
* **Bob is anchoring:** Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation around a 60/40 split in his favor. By rejecting, Alice shows she's not easily swayed and aims for a more balanced outcome.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Rejecting keeps the conversation going and gives Alice a chance to propose a deal closer to her ideal outcome in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer acknowledges the time pressure but is fairer to both of us in the long run.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the time pressure:** Offering Bob slightly more than he'd get in his proposed 60/40 split after another round of inflation might make the offer more appealing. 
* **Still favorable to Alice:**  While this offer is less than Alice's initial proposal, it's still a better outcome than accepting Bob's 60/40 split, even after accounting for another round of inflation on her end.
* **Striking a balance:** This offer aims to be attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the time pressure on Alice, while still securing a reasonable amount for Alice."
