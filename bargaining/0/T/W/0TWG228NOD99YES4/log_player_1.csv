Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. We both need to be mindful of the shrinking value, so let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Even though Bob offered this in round 1, I'm accepting now in round 4.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and getting to round 12 means we both get nothing. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer seems the same as round 1, the value has decreased significantly for him due to the 20% per round inflation.  Delaying any further hurts him more than me.
* **Fairness:** A 60/40 split in my favor is good, especially considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm impacted less by the inflation."
