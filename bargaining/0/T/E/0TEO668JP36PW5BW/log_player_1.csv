"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and take 60. You can't do better than this, right?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We can end this quickly and both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 50 is actually worth 40 in real value, and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 45 in real value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split, considering I'm getting a slightly worse deal in real terms. Let me think...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said we could end this quickly, but it seems you're not serious. I'll give you 45, but I need 55 to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to end this, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 40 is actually worth 26.4 in real value, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 73.9 in real value.

I'm not happy with the fact that Bob is getting a significantly larger share, especially considering I was willing to give him 45 in the previous round. I think I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less for me now, I'll try to get an even better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""You're not willing to give me a fair deal, so I'll take 48 and leave you with 52. Don't expect me to be generous anymore.""
