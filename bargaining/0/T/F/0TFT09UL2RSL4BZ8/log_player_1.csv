"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 3/4 and you'll get 1/4. That's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
