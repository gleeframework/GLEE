Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the majority. I'm hoping to secure a good share early on, considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases for Bob, making him less likely to offer such an even split in the future. I'll take the guaranteed 5000, especially given the inflation risk."
