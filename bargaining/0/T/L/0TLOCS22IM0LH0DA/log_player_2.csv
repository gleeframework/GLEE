Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast. Let's compromise. I'll come down a bit to 58/42.  Keep in mind, the clock is ticking, and that money is shrinking for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is a factor, but it's hurting me more than her. It's worth risking another round to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
