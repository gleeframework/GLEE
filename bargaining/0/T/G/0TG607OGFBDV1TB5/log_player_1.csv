"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 30 is now worth 95% of the original value, which is $28.50.

I'm not too happy with this offer, as I'd like to get more than 28.50. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better one. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
