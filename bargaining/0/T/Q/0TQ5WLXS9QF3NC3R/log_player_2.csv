"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Trying to find a middle ground, accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Trying to be more flexible, but still considering the inflation advantage on my side. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is attempting to be ""flexible"", the deal still heavily favors her due to the inflation working against me. I need to push for a better split, knowing that she'll want to avoid letting the money dwindle to nothing in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic.  The inflation means every round hurts me more.  This offer gives me a significant share to compensate, and you still get something before it shrinks further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Continuing to adjust for the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's side, hoping to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is starting to get close to a reasonable split considering the significant impact inflation is having. If I reject this and Alice doesn't shift significantly in the next round, the remaining value will dwindle rapidly, making it unlikely we'll find a better outcome."
