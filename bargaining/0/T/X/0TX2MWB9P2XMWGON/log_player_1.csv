"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount, and I'm keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less than it was in the first round, but still a 50/50 split. I'll consider it a fair offer, especially since it's a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
