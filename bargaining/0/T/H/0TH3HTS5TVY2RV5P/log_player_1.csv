"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a generous offer, let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks it's a fair deal, but I'm not so sure. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather get a bigger share. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not splitting it evenly, I want more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 40% less for Bob (20% less than the first round, and another 20% less than the second round), I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a small share, but it's still better than nothing!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share than the initial 50/50 split, but I need to get something closer to that to be happy. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you the majority share, I want more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 69.2% less for Bob (20% less than the first round, and another 20% less than the second round, and another 20% less than the third round, and another 9.2% less than the fourth round), I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a tiny share, but it's the best you'll get!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an extremely small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are both losing value with each round. Let's compromise - I'll take a slightly smaller share, but we can finally finalize this deal. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now. Considering the significant loss of value for Bob, I'll consider his offer. Since I'm getting a decent share, I'll accept his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's end this and get our shares!""
}
```"
