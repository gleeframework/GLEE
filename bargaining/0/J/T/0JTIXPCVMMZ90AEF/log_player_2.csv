"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division benefits us both considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation we both face, even though yours is more significant.  Let's close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your offer doesn't reflect the urgency of inflation for me. This revised offer is fair and lets us both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Alice is taking advantage of my aversion to risk with inflation, but her offer is getting closer to a point I'd accept. Holding out one more round might force her to be more equitable."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
