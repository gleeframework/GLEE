I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'll take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to adjust my proposal. With inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll take $7,200, leaving $2,800 for Bob.  Let's see if he finds this offer more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low!  I'm not going to accept it. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. I'll offer $5,760 for myself and $4,240 for Bob. Hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair compromise."
