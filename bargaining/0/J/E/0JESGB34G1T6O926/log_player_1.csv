I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, giving me a decent chunk of the money while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob $190,000. This is a little less than his offer to me, but I'm hoping that he'll see that it's still a good deal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a tough one.  While the money is worth a lot less now, I'm not sure I'll do better if I reject and make another offer.  I'll accept."
