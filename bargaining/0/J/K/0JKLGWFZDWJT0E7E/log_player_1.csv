"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game underway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it to get some money, even if it's not ideal. I'll have to be more careful with my next proposal to make up for the lost value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
