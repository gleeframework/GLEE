"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again!

Considering the 40% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll aim for a more substantial share. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer!

Considering the significant drop in value, I think I should be more aggressive in my negotiation. However, Bob's offer is still quite close to the original 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer.
