"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives Alice a large portion of the money but leaves a small amount for Bob. This is a classic negotiation tactic to see if Bob will accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects the offer and the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
This offer is a compromise compared to the first round.  It shows Alice is willing to negotiate but still seeks a larger share of the money."
