"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's share fairly"" to Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a significant amount of money. Since there's no inflation for Bob, he may be more willing to accept a lower offer, but I'll start with a relatively generous split to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of an even split. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I have to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, an even split would actually be less favorable to me than it appears. I'll hold out for a better offer, hoping to get more value in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation factor and try to make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Bob. Since the money is worth 20% less to me than in the first round, and another 20% less in this round, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nI'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" to Bob. This offer takes into account the decreased value of the money for me, while still offering Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping that Bob will understand the reasoning behind my offer and accept it."
