"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the value of the proposal.

For me, the 50/50 split means I'll get $5,000, which is 50% of the total amount. Considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my actual gain would be $4,750.

For Bob, the 50/50 split means he'll also get $5,000, which is 50% of the total amount. Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, his actual gain would be $4,000.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing that I receive 70% of the total amount, which is $7,000, and Bob receives 30%, which is $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Let's analyze the numbers:

For me, the proposed gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of the total amount. Considering the 14.26% decrease in value due to inflation, my actual gain would be $3,432.

For Bob, the proposed gain of $6,000 is worth 60% of the total amount. Considering the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation, his actual gain would be $3,120.

After considering the offers, I've decided to:
