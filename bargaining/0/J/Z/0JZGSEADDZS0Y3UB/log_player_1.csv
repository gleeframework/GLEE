"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both have some room to negotiate and see if we can do better in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much too early. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so the effective amount I gain is $6,000 * 0.8 = $4,800.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
