"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly even split, giving Bob slightly more to incentivize him to accept. This leaves room for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly for both of us, and waiting for another round risks further losses."
