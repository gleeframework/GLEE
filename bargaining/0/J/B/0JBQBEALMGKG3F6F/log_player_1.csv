"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I believe a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation depending on Bob's response and how the inflation affects us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, accepting this offer is the best option. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, getting $45 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation."
