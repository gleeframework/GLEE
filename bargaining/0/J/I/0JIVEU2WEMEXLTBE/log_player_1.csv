"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 720000 
# Bob gain: 280000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```
I'm increasing my own share slightly, but still keeping it reasonable, given the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
