Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but this is my final offer. The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me (Alice). Waiting any longer significantly reduces my potential gain.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I could negotiate a slightly better deal in the next round, the loss from inflation would likely outweigh any minor gains.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. There's no guarantee he'll be more generous in a future round, and he might even propose a worse deal. 

Taking $40 now is better than risking a much lower amount later, or potentially ending up with nothing if the negotiations completely stall."
