"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave 1000 for Bob. It's a large share for me, but as the rounds progress, the money loses value faster for me, so I want to secure a larger portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate makes it more advantageous to accept this offer.  If I reject, I risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
