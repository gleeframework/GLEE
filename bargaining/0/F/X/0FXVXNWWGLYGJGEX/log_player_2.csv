"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the bigger share, but you'll still get something. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a way that I get a bit more since I'm under time pressure with the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet halfway. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal than what's being offered. Alice is trying to meet halfway, but the compromise doesn't account for the loss in value I'm experiencing. I want to try to get more before the value drops further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my expectations, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground that accounts for my loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round, so let's make a deal that's fair to both of us. This is my final offer, or we risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (59.04% less than the original value), Alice's offer of $3000 for me seems like the best deal I can get. Although it's less than what I initially hoped for, the risk of proceeding further and possibly getting nothing due to the 12-round limit or further devaluation makes this offer more appealing. It's time to accept and secure what I can."
