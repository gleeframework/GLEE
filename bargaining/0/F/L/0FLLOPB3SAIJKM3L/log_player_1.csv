I'm not going to accept a worse deal than the first round, especially since the money I gain is losing value!  I'll wait and see what Bob offers next."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it is a slightly better offer than the last round, it's still less than the original even split and the money I get is worth significantly less now. I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer deal."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation, Alice. I think we should aim for a fair split before things get out of control. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation is really hurting my gains, and this is a fair split for both of us. It's better to agree now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
