"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. A 52.5/47.5 split seems reasonable for a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly higher risk in rejecting your offer. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about risk, but a 55/45 split is a significant jump from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit fairly from a swift resolution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
