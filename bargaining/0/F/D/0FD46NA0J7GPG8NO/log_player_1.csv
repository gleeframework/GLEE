"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll start by proposing a division that seems reasonably fair, considering the conditions. Since the value of the money decreases by 10% for me with each round, I have an incentive to end the game sooner. Offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total, might be seen as a generous offer given the circumstances, as he does not lose any value over time. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer, ensuring we both walk away with a significant amount before the money's value starts to decrease for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no need for drama. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair under normal circumstances, the 10% decrease in value for me changes the dynamics. Accepting this offer would mean I effectively get less value than Bob, considering the inflation. I believe I can propose a better division in the next round that still benefits Bob but also accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nGiven the inflation factor, I'll adjust my offer slightly from the first round to still be appealing to Bob but also reflect the loss in value I'm experiencing. This offer is still generous, considering the circumstances, but aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, given that we both want to walk away with something before the money's value decreases further for me."
