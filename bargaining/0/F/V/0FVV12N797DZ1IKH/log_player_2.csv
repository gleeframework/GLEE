"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. A slightly larger share for me ensures we both benefit before inflation diminishes our returns. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while still giving us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but with the inflation, I need to get a little more to make it worthwhile.  Let's split the difference this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a compromise that considers the inflation but still gives us both a decent cut. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still not ideal, with inflation continuing to eat away at my share, I'm running out of rounds and the risk of getting nothing is high. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least some money."
