"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. A slightly larger share for me ensures we both benefit before inflation diminishes our returns.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice. We both get a fair amount before inflation takes its bite. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to a perfectly even split while the value of his potential gain decreases faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while still giving us both a reasonable share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but with the inflation, I need to get a little more to make it worthwhile.  Let's split the difference this time. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate and trying to flip the script, offering me the deal I just proposed while the inflation is working heavily in my favor. I need to hold firm to get a better deal while I still have the upper hand."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5125,
""bob_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's a compromise that considers the inflation but still gives us both a decent cut. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply some pressure and set a firm boundary. This offer is a slight concession on my part, but it's still heavily in my favor considering the inflation working against Bob. The ""take it or leave it"" approach might push him to accept before he loses even more ground."
