"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the initial offer I made. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer I made""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made."
