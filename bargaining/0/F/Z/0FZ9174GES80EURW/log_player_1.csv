"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm offering Bob the bare minimum to incentivize him to accept quickly, knowing the money will be worth less to him in future rounds.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer.  Let's see if he'll reconsider when the money is worth even less to him in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money.  It's likely that Bob will continue to be greedy, but with each passing round, the money will be worth less to him.  Hopefully, he'll realize that it's better to take a small amount than nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still ridiculously lopsided.  He's getting greedy and not recognizing the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him. I'm going to keep rejecting until he realizes he needs to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 97, ""bob_gain"": 3}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping the majority of the money.  Bob's greed is getting out of hand, and I'm hoping that by showing some willingness to compromise, I can start to steer him towards a more reasonable offer.  The money is losing value so quickly for him that I'm confident I can get a good deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly one-sided, and he's losing the value of the money rapidly. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if we keep going. I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a slightly increased share, but still keeping the lion's share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 96, ""bob_gain"": 4}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but Bob's greed is becoming increasingly irrational.  The money is losing value rapidly for him, and he's risking getting nothing at all.  I'm confident that he'll finally come to his senses soon and accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being extremely stubborn. His greed is getting the better of him, and he's losing out on a significant amount of money. I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands. It's getting late in the game, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm upping my offer again, but I'm starting to worry.  Bob is becoming increasingly irrational, and the money is losing value very quickly for him. I'm hoping that he'll come to his senses and accept a reasonable offer before we run out of time.  This is my last chance to secure a good deal before the inflation really starts to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clinging to his greed.  He's clearly not understanding how much value the money is losing for him.  While I'm starting to get nervous, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  It's almost the end of the game, but I need to stay firm and hope that Bob comes to his senses before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my final offer. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's risking getting nothing at all.  It's a significant increase from my previous offers, but I'm still taking the lion's share. This is my last chance to secure a good deal. Let's see if his greed finally gives way to reason."
