I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it.  I'm aware of the inflation, but since this is the first round, it's not yet a huge factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise in this round. With inflation affecting Bob's gain, it's likely he won't be offering a better deal in the future. Accepting ensures I get at least half the money, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome if I reject."
