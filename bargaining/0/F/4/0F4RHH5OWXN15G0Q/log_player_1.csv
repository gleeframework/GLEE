"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60-40 split.  Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor, since I'm making the offer this round.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in your favor, especially since you're the one making the offer this round. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not getting all the cream, Bob!""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going down to 40%!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
