"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll reject it for now. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game."
