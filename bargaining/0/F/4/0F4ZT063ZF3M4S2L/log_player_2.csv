"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's effectively $80.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less, I should aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Alice's offer is still quite generous, considering the current value of the money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Alice won't make a similar offer in the next round.
