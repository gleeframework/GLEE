**Reasoning:**

While the money is losing value fast, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation.  I need to hold out for a better deal still.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate she'll become as well, even though her losses are smaller."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice. Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value is dropping rapidly, and Alice is clearly playing a tough game. Offering a 50/50 split shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not willing to be exploited. This eliminates further negotiation and puts the pressure on her. It's getting too risky to hold out for more."
