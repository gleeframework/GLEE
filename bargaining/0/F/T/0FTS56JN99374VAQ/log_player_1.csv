"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 90% is a more reasonable share, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
