Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting this offer in Round 3 is better than risking further losses to inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the more value the money loses. This is especially crucial for Bob, as his money is devalued at a slower rate than Alice's.
* **Offer Analysis:** Alice's offer is slightly in her favor, but the difference is not substantial enough to warrant risking further inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Alice's future offers will be better. She might offer even less in subsequent rounds, putting Bob in a weaker position. 

Therefore, accepting in Round 3 is a pragmatic choice, balancing potential gain against the risk of greater losses.
