"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'll make a new offer in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor."
