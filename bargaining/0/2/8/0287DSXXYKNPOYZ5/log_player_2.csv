"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's ""fair"" in a sense, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation will affect Alice's gains more than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly, taking into account the inflation that will hit you harder.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to find a middle ground. This division takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, while still acknowledging the higher inflation rate I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is already impacting my potential gains significantly. Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split and acknowledging the inflation differences, which seems like a good compromise given the time constraint and potential for further loss."
