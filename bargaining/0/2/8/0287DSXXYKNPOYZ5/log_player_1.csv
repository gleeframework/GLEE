"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. Given this, I've proposed a division that slightly favors me to compensate for the higher rate of inflation I'm facing. However, the offer still ensures that Bob receives a substantial amount, making it a fair and reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly, taking into account the inflation that will hit you harder. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject this offer because, considering the inflation rates, accepting 40 dollars in the second round would actually be worth significantly less than its face value, due to the 20% decrease from the first round. This division does not adequately account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share, and I believe a more balanced proposal can be reached in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to find a middle ground. This division takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, while still acknowledging the higher inflation rate I'm facing.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my share from the initial 60 dollars to 58 dollars, increasing Bob's share to 42 dollars. This adjustment aims to find a compromise that considers the effects of inflation on both parties, while still recognizing the greater impact it has on me. By making this concession, I'm hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."
