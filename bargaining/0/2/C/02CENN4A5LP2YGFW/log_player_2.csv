Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your stance on a simple split, but we need to be realistic about the shrinking pot. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing dramatically increases. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round that passes makes the money worth significantly less for Bob due to the 5% inflation. Waiting any longer means accepting even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Holding out for a better deal might not be realistic, and could lead to a stalemate.

It's a tough decision, but accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking a complete loss later."
