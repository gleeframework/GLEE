"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

I'll reject this offer because I'll be getting $400,000, which is worth 5% less than the $500,000 I could have gotten in the first round, and Bob is getting $600,000, which is worth 20% less than the $750,000 he could have gotten in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3, taking into account the 5% inflation that affects my gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't get too greedy!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of my potential gain in the first round, which is $500,000, and then adjust for the 14.26% inflation. $500,000 * 0.8526 = $427,300.

Comparing this to Bob's offer of $450,000, I'll reject this offer because I'm not getting as good a deal as I could have gotten in the first round, adjusted for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 5, taking into account the 14.26% inflation that affects my gain.

Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a gain that's equivalent to 86.74% of $500,000, which is $433,700.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 433700,
  ""bob_gain"": 566300,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you more, this is my final offer!""
}
