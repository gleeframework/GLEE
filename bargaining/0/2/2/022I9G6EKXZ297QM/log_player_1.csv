# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money closer to 50/50. This offer is the best I can do, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the value of his potential earnings decreases.  While his offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I'm still in a strong position to push for a better deal in the next round."
