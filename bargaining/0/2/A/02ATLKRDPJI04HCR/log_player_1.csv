"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, $900,000 was a generous offer, but now it's worth less due to inflation.

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation that has already occurred.

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more modest offer, considering the inflation. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this revised offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the idea of taking only $300,000, especially since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.
