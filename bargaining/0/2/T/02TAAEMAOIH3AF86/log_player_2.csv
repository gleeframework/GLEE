"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 100k and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not satisfied with a mere $100,000.  I'm sure I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm sure we can both do better.  Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the larger share.  After all, I'm the one taking the risk by going another round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This round the money is worth less to me, so we can both walk away with a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's getting riskier with each round, and I don't want to end up with nothing!"
