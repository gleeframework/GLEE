"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a little less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40/60 split, as I was hoping for a more equal division. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still gives Bob a slightly better deal."
