I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a significant share for me while still offering Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I reject this offer. While it's better than the previous one, I'm still not satisfied with a 45/55 split. I'll propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split this time. I think it's a fair compromise considering my previous offer and Bob's counter-offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept this."
