"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted fair, I'll offer you less 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me with his offer. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 300,000$ is actually 90% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant amount. However, I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You offered me less, I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go all the way!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself, trying to find a balance between giving him a bit more and not giving in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll take it 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept his offer by making it seem like I'm not giving him enough. However, considering the inflation effect, my gain of 400,000$ is actually 40% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'd like to try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, my offer for round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need something closer to 50/50""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 510,000$ and keeping 490,000$ for myself, trying to get closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but still not there 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to squeeze a bit more out of me. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 450,000$ is actually 45% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant reduction.

However, I'm not willing to give up much more. I'll accept this offer, as it's getting close to the 50/50 split I was aiming for, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even lower potential gain.
