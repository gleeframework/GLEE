"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give 10 dollars to Bob. This ensures a quick and relatively fair division, given that I am the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I propose a division of 70 dollars for me and 30 dollars for Bob.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I am offering him more this time.  This is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact that I will be proposing again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the value of the money has decreased considerably, accepting this offer allows me to secure some money rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
