Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher share, but I think 60 is the maximum I'm willing to offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
