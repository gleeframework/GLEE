"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. Since there's no inflation in the first round, this seems like a reasonable starting point. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this division is somewhat fair, but also acknowledges that I'm taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than your previous offer after inflation is considered. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Bob's offer might seem reasonable considering the inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'd like to try and get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for both of us""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose a division where I receive $58 and Bob receives $42. Given the inflation, this offer is more generous to Bob than my initial proposal. I've included a message highlighting that this deal is better for both of us, taking into account the decreased value of the money for me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. This is the fairest deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than the first round), splitting the money evenly seems like a reasonable and fair deal. I don't think I can negotiate a better offer, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for me. It's time to accept and take the $50."
