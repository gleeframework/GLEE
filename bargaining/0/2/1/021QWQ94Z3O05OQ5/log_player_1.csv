"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was too low. Let's split the difference a bit more this time, with a slight advantage for me considering the faster inflation working against me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
