"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer, and we can start negotiating from here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $400,000 is worth less than my initial share of $550,000. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my share is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my share! Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob's offer is a significant one.

I'll accept this offer.
