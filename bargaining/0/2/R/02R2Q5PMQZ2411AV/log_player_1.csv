"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten more in the first round, I'm not sure I'll be so generous next time! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, so I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""}

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive approach, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's a fair compromise. The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains, and I don't want to risk going to zero. Meeting in the middle seems like a good way to split the difference and salvage what's left."
