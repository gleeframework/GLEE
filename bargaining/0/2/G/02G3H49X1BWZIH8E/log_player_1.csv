"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 4800
Bob's gain: 4750

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You got a good deal! Let's shake on it!""
}
```"
