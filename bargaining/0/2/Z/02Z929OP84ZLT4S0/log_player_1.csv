"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation disadvantage I will face in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, albeit a smaller one than I initially proposed.  The inflation rate means that rejecting and going to the next round could result in an even lower share for me."
