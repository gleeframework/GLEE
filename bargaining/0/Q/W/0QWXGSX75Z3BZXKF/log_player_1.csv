Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share, but I'm offering Bob a decent amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting less than I was hoping for, it's still a significant amount of money.  I'm confident I can do better if I get to make the offer next round.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and find a balance between a good amount for myself and something that might entice Bob to accept.  Inflation is biting harder for him, so I'm hoping this is enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is seriously hurting Bob at this point.  I'm getting a lot less than I hoped for, but with each round the value keeps decreasing.  It's better to take this deal and secure a decent sum than risk losing even more."
