I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to hopefully make him consider accepting. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation is going to make future rounds even worse.  It's better to take a solid 500,000 than risk getting much less later on."
