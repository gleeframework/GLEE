"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the actual amount.

I'm not too thrilled about giving up $200,000, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 0% less for me, but 44% less for Bob (20% less than the first round, and an additional 24% less from the second round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being more generous, but I think I deserve more this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share!

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the actual amount. I'm not thrilled about giving up $200,000, but I'll think about it...

However, I'm not convinced that I should give Bob such a large share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 0% less for me, but 68.8% less for Bob (20% less in the first round, 24% less in the second round, and 24.8% less in the third round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split, but I'm not budging""
}
```

I'm trying to get back to a fair split, but I'm not willing to give in to Bob's demands!"
