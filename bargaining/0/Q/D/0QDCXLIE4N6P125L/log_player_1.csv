I'm going to try and get as much as possible this round, knowing the money will be worth less in future rounds.  I'm offering Bob $1 just to keep him happy and hopefully accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this a good deal. I'm guaranteed half the money now, and any further rounds risk losing more due to inflation."
