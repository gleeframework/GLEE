"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 10% share. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering you a 45% share, which is more than what you offered me last round.  This way we both get a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 45% is too low.  Let's split it 60/40.  This way we both get a decent amount and can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, 40% is better than nothing and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. It's time to end this negotiation."
