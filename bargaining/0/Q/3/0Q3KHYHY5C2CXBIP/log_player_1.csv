"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial $50. So, my effective gain in this round would be $50 * 0.95 = $47.50.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $70, which is a significant increase from the initial 50/50 split. However, I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's generosity. His message suggests he's not being generous, which might imply he's trying to take advantage of me.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, hoping to get a better deal than the 70/30 split Bob offered earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than the initial $50, which is $50 * 0.85474 = $42.737. However, since we're dividing the current $100, my effective gain in this round would be $42.74.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $80, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. Bob's message suggests he's still trying to get a good deal, but he's being more generous than in the previous rounds.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a good compromise given the circumstances.
