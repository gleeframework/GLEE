"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the original $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine in Round 1, but with the effects of inflation. I'll reject this offer since it's not a new proposal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing given the reduced value of the money."
