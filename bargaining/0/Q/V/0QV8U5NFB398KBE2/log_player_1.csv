"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my first offer. I'm taking a large share, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even with the inflation, I can still get more in later rounds if I keep playing. I need to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the first round. I believe Bob will still see this as a good deal, given the inflation factor and the fact that he'll be able to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but this time only slightly. Inflation is biting now, but I'm still hoping to secure a reasonable share. If Bob rejects, I'll be losing more money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains. While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is the best I can get at this point.  I'd rather have something than nothing."
