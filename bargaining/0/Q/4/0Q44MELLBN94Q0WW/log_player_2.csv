"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 55/45 split is a good way to begin. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should aim for a more even split.  I'm willing to offer 60/40, but let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we should aim for an equal split now.  We both lose money if we keep rejecting each other's offers, so let's be reasonable and split it 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is starting to become a concern.  A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome."
