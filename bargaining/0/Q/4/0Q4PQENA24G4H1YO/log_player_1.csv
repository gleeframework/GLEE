"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: $50 * 0.8 = $40
Bob's gain: $50 * 0.8 = $40

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and I get a decent amount of money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
