Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is getting closer to an even split, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting $450,000 now is worth considerably less than what it was worth in Round 1.  It's worth holding out for a better offer, even if it means a slight risk in the later rounds."
