# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to make a final, last-chance offer, and it's a bit more generous than his previous one. I'll think about it...

Hmm... $700,000 is a decent offer, but I was hoping to get more. On the other hand, if I reject it, we both get nothing, which is a worst-case scenario. I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively good deal for me.
