"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting a raw deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to settle for a raw deal!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You said I was getting a raw deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting a bad deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal. The money is worth less and less with each round, so I need to be careful not to give up too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, but I am. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, given the decreasing value of the money."
