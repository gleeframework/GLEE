"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm sure we can both find good use for this money.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But this is a bit too much in your favor. How about we split it 60/40, so we both get a decent share? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
