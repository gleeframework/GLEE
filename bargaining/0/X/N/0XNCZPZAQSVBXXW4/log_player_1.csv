I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'm taking a large share, but I'm aware of inflation and want to avoid too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is unfair, and while I'm aware of inflation, taking only $1000 is not a good outcome.  I'll push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my desired amount, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of ending the game soon, as inflation will continue to erode my share if we keep going."
