"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a larger share of the money. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total, especially since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split this time, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and the changing value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a reasonable offer."
