"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing on a friendly message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I now have to consider a 20% decrease in the value of the money I gain.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40/60. I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You said you could do better than 50/50, let's try 48/52!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, trying to nudge the ratio in my favor slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I think I'm getting closer to a good deal. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I now have to consider a 48.8% decrease in the value of the money I gain.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide:

```
{

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value now (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at 38/62, a slight adjustment from the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to the middle but still in my favor."

# Bob's message: I'm starting to think I should just take the majority. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 32.77% of its original value now (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%). I'll have to decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining value. I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 7."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 32.77% of its original value now. I'll make a new proposal:

  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! Let's try 23/77, a slight adjustment from the majority""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging. Take it or leave it!

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 20.97% of its original value now (100% - 79.03% = 20.97%). I'll have to decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the remaining value is relatively small, and I'd rather take the 10% share than risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns."
