"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 8000 and Bob gets 2000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
