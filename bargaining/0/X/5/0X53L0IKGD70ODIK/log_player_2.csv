Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a larger share than 40% due to the diminishing value of money for me. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases faster for me than for her. Accepting a 40/60 split at this stage would leave me with significantly less value in the long run. I need to push for a better split in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value with each round, Bob. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. This is the most reasonable option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The money is losing value quickly, especially for me.  Waiting longer means significantly less gain, even if I manage to negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in the remaining rounds carries a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement at all, leaving us both with nothing. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not reflecting the initial inflation disparity, is a fair compromise at this point in the game. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed, albeit smaller, sum now than to gamble on a potentially larger but increasingly unlikely gain later."
