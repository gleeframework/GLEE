"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This is a fairly aggressive first offer, but I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly better than the previous round's, I'm still not satisfied with a 10/90 split. I will try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer, reflecting the inflation that has occurred.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise."
