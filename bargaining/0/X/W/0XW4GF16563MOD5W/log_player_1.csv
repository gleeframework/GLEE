"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and take the rest, a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 200,000 and Bob can have the rest. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to another round."
