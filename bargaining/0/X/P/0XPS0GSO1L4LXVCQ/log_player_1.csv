"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, my gain of $5800 is now worth $5,510 (95% of $5800) and Bob's gain of $4200 is now worth $3,810 (90% of $4200).

I accept this offer.
