Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not fair considering inflation, I'll take more 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While it stings to see the potential gains shrink, accepting a deal this unfair sets a bad precedent. There's a chance she'll become more reasonable closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you more than I would get, even with the inflation. Take it or leave it.""}

# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'll take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, as the offer is getting abysmal with the inflation. However, Alice's tone suggests she's confident in running the clock down. Accepting this would be admitting defeat. There's a slim chance she'll panic in the last few rounds and offer something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alright, this is my final offer. It's more than generous considering the inflation, but I'd rather get this over with than risk getting nothing. Don't be greedy, Alice.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** This is a high-stakes gamble.  Alice has been ruthless, but the end is near.  Offering slightly more than her last offer might be tempting enough, especially with the ""don't be greedy"" appeal. It's a risk, but waiting might lead to even worse offers from her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a heartbreaking decision, but with only one round left, Alice has all the leverage. Rejecting this offer means risking a worse offer in the final round, or even getting nothing at all. The inflation has taken a huge toll, but taking $300,000 is better than walking away empty-handed."
