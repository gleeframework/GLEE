"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself. I included the message ""Let's be fair"" to suggest that my offer is reasonable and encourage Bob to accept it. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's in both our best interests to get something rather than risk losing more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressure from inflation to accept a less favorable offer. Additionally, I initially offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself, so accepting an even split would be a concession on my part. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more favorable outcome. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI offered Bob $450,000 and kept $550,000 for myself. My message suggests that this offer is a compromise between our previous proposals, as it's midway between the $400,000 I initially offered Bob and the $500,000 he offered me in the second round. I'm trying to appear reasonable and flexible, while still getting a slightly better deal than an even split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
