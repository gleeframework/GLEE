60.0,40.0,"I propose we take $60, and you take $40.  It's a generous offer to start.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,"I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it 65/35, with me getting the larger share.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, that's not how this works. My turn now. I'll take $58, leaving you with $42.  The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping...",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 70/30 in my favor. We both need to be realistic about the inflation.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid ending up with nothing.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm dropping my offer to $55, you get $45. Take it before it's too late for both of us!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my guns.  We're getting closer to the end, and the value is dropping rapidly.  Let's split it 75/25, and at least we'll both get something.  It's a better deal than we'll get if we keep rejecting each other.",Bob,6,

,,,Bob,7,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, this is getting out of hand.  We're losing a lot of value. Let's be sensible and split it 80/20.  It's a better deal for both of us than continuing to lose money.  Time is running out!",Bob,8,
