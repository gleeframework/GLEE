"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us going""
}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000 in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of the original value. Considering the new values, I'll evaluate the offer:

```
# Alice gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400
# Bob gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to get more. I'll make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll think about my next offer..."
