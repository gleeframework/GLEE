"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time, Alice. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still considering the same value for the money as in the first round.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think a 50-50 split is a bit too low for me, given the initial proposal I made. However, it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
