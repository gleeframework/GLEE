"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first move.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the new values, I realize that Bob's offer is actually quite aggressive, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving up too much.""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I'll get $4,500 and Bob will get $5,500."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are really starting to add up! The value of my potential gain is dropping rapidly.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm not thrilled about getting only $2,000, especially when Bob is getting $8,000.

However, I'm not willing to risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
