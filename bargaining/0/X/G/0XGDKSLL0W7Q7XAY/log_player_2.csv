"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take most of the money, but you get a small share.  It's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is technically better than nothing, it's highly unfair. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and since the money decreases in value for Alice with each round, I'm confident we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money. We both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing value in future rounds.""}
