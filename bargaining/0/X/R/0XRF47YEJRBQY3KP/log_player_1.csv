"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my gain is worth 5% less than in round 1,  Bob's gain is worth 10% less. This means the offer is relatively more favorable for me in this round.
* **Fairness:** The offer is a 50/50 split, which is generally considered fair.
* **Risk:** Rejecting the offer means I have to make a proposal in the next round. While I could potentially get a better deal, there's also a risk that Bob will reject my offer, leaving me with a much smaller share due to further inflation. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum of money, and the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round outweighs the potential for a slightly larger gain."
