Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 51/49 split in my favor is more equitable, given the risk of the game.  This offers a fair return for taking the first step, while still leaving you with a generous amount. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
