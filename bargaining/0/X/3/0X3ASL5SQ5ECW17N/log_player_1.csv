"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was fair, but the value of the money decreases for both of us as we play. I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me this round to account for that.  Let's close this out quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
