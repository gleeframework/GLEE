"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer slightly favors Alice. While it seems like a decent starting point, I'm willing to forgo a small amount in the hopes of securing a more equitable split in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I appreciate the sentiment of fairness, but I believe a slightly more balanced split is in order. This offer reflects that, and we should settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is hurting you more than me. I'm willing to be slightly more generous than your last offer, but let's close this deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right about time running out, but she's using that as leverage to get a better deal. I'll hold out a little longer and hope she becomes more agreeable as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  It's the fairest option and avoids further losses due to inflation.""}
