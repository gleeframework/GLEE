{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40, but this time I'll take the larger share.  It's a fair trade, considering the money is now worth less for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with that proposal.  Since the money is worth less now, let's compromise.  I'll take 55, you take 45.  It's still a fair split given the current value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
