900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal.  I'm offering you 10% of the money. This gives you a good start and leaves plenty for me. We can always renegotiate later.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think 40% is a fair share for you. Remember, the money is losing value for you with each passing round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I'm willing to split the money evenly now. It's clear we can't agree on a deal where one of us gets significantly more. Let's end this on a fair note.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the money's decreasing value for you, I think 45% is a generous offer. It's better to accept now rather than lose more value in the next round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
