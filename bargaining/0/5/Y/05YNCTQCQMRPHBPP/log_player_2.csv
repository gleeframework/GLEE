Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly clinging to a larger share, but the tide is turning.  With each round, the value of her offer decreases for me. It's time to play hardball, as the pressure is mounting on both of us.  We're past the halfway point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer, and our last chance to secure a good deal. Time is literally money in this scenario, and I'm offering you a significant amount. Let's close this out and both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure by framing this as our ""last chance"" for a ""good deal.""  While not entirely true, the sense of urgency might sway Alice. This offer is still in my favor if accepted, considering the inflation, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate under the right terms."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make small concessions, but I still believe I have the upper hand. This is my revised offer, considering the increasing pressure on you. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, but she's still not understanding the severity of the situation for me. Her ""concessions"" are minimal. By rejecting this offer, I send a clear message that I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer split as the clock ticks down."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and I'm offering you a deal where you still come out ahead. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. Accept this offer, and we both win.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble, but a calculated one. I'm offering a slightly improved deal than my previous offer,  appealing to both her desire for a larger share and the looming deadline. The strong language is intentional, meant to spur her into action. If she rejects this, I'm shifting my strategy in the remaining rounds to aim for a near-even split, as the inflation will make even her ""generous"" offers less appealing."
