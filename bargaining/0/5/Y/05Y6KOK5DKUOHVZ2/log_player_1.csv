"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to Round 3. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my offer will be worth even less than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to keep some for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
