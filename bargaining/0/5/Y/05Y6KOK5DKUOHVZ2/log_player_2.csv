"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this and we can call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers next. 2000 is not a very good deal, and I can likely do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a bit greedy, Bob. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is decent and Alice is getting much less than she was originally asking for.  It's a good time to end the game."
