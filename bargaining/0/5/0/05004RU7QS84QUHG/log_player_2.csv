Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the remaining 10%.  It's a good start, right?

Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  It's still a good deal, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's a better offer than the first, 40% is still not a great deal. Let's see if we can push for more."
