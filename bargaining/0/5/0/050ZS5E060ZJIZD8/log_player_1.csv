"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer from Bob.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm being too greedy, and I'd like to see a more substantial offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was a bit more in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55/45""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were close, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I was close, but not quite there!

I'll take a closer look at Bob's new offer:

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It seems like we've met in the middle, and I'm willing to settle for $4,500."
