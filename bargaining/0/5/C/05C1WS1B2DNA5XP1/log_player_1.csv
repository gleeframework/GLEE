"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair split, but I'm taking the majority of the pie. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that's a pretty lopsided offer from Bob! I'd rather not give him 70% of the money.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

Let's see if Bob accepts this 50-50 split!"
