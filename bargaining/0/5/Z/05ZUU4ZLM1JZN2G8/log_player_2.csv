Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and split the money evenly. This is the best way to ensure we both get a reasonable share, even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth.  While Alice's offer was initially heavily skewed in her favor, the impact of inflation is hitting you harder. 
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. While you could gamble on getting more in a later round, the shrinking value of the money makes it a risky proposition.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  By accepting now, you guarantee yourself a significant sum. Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in future rounds as the money continues to lose value."
