Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but I think I can do a bit better than 55-45. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but we're not desperate yet.  A firm rejection might make her reconsider a more significant jump towards a 50/50 split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and that money is losing value fast. 52/48 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  This offer shows Alice we're serious about a more even split and willing to walk away. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Bumping up to 48% for Bob is a small concession to entice Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot, pushing for a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 52/48 was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll take a smaller step back, and we can still both walk away with something decent. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to play a game of chicken. She doesn't believe Bob is actually willing to walk away. While the inflation is getting severe, accepting a deal this lopsided sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. There's a chance Alice might concede significantly in the next round to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is ridiculous, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** It's time to draw a line in the sand. The 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical. 
* **Ultimatum:** The ""take it or leave it"" language makes it clear this is a non-negotiable offer.
* **Highlighting Shared Risk:** Reminding Alice that continued stalling hurts them both adds weight to the ultimatum."
