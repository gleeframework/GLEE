"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000 and take 6000 for myself. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you a fair share, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll evaluate it as follows:

* My gain: $4500, which is worth 95% of $4500 (due to 5% inflation) = $4275
* Bob's gain: $5500, which is still $5500 (no inflation effect on Bob's gain)

After evaluating the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to get a bit more than $4275. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 4200 and you can take 5800. Let's end the game.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly smaller share to try to end the game quickly."
