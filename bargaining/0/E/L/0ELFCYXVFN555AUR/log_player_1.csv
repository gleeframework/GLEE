  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very one-sided offer! I'll reject it.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

I'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor, but it's still a relatively fair offer considering the previous rejection."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to find a balance between a fair and a more advantageous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
