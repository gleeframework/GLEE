"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly down the middle. A fair deal is better than risking inflation eating our money!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a slightly better deal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The threat of inflation means we need to push for a more equitable split sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering a slight advantage for you, but this ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation eats away at it too much more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, this is as low as I'm willing to go 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offer isn't perfectly even, accepting guarantees a reasonable payout before inflation significantly diminishes the value. Rejecting at this stage risks ending up with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
