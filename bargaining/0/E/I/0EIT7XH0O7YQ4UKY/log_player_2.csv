**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly more acceptable with each round that passes due to the impact of inflation on her potential gains.  Here's why I'm choosing to accept now:

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Each round makes the deal worse for Alice, but it doesn't get any better for me. Waiting any longer might make Alice desperate enough to offer me even less, or she might refuse to negotiate further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of Alice's offers becoming significantly worse in future rounds.
* **Current Offer:** Accepting $4,400 now is better than potentially getting a slightly higher amount in later rounds when Alice's perception of the value has diminished further. 

It's a compromise, but in negotiation, sometimes accepting a decent offer in time is better than holding out for an ideal outcome that might not materialize."
