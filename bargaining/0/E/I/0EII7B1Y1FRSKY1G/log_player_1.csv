Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This offer considers the time pressure we both face with the decreasing value.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 40

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking! I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This offer recognizes the time pressure and offers a more balanced outcome. Don't miss out! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although the offer is getting closer to a more even split, Bob's share is devaluing much faster than mine. I'm willing to play the long game and see if I can secure a better deal in a later round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day.  It's the fairest deal for both of us considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Bob is finally catching on to the reality of his situation.  While I might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more in later rounds, it's getting too risky. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point ensures I get a reasonable share and avoids the disaster of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
