"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, and I'll get $60. It's a fair split, and we can both walk away with some money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to mirror my previous offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll reject this offer for now. My current gain of $40 is worth less than my initial proposal, so I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, and I'll get $55. This way, I'm trying to account for the decrease in value due to inflation."
