"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I get $60, you get $40. It's a good offer, Bob, especially considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
Explanation: While the offer seems decent at first glance, Bob stands to gain significantly more if he waits. Alice's share loses value much faster than his. It's worth risking a slightly worse offer in the next round for the potential of a much better outcome later."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Things are getting less valuable Alice, but I'm feeling generous. How about we switch it up from last round?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this inflation is eating our money!  Let's be reasonable. I'll take a little less, you take a little more. $55 for me, $45 for you. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Explanation: This is a tricky one, but accepting is the safer play now. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While waiting longer means Alice's share theoretically gets less appealing, the difference between a 60/40 and 55/45 split is shrinking due to the inflation hitting Bob too. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 60/40 split in Bob's favor is highly unlikely at this point. Alice is feeling the pressure too and won't want to lose much more value. Accepting now guarantees a decent share.
* **Inflation's Bite:** Another round means Bob's potential gains shrink further. The longer this goes on, the less significant the difference in their relative losses becomes."
