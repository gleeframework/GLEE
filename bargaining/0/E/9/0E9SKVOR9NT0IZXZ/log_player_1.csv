"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'd rather not accept a worse deal than the one I proposed earlier. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll ask for a bit more. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the decreasing value of the money, I think I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
