"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, reflecting our equal contributions. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. While it's slightly more generous than my initial offer, I think I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal division of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation."
