Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see if he's greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with inflation, accepting 10% of $100 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
