"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor. This ensures you still get a significant majority while recognizing the time value of money for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
