Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be fair.  I propose a 52/48 split in my favor.  We're losing money fast with this inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose with every round. I'm offering you 4500.  Take it before it shrinks further!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.  Any more rounds and we'll both be losing out significantly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob is finally being reasonable! While I could try to squeeze a little more, it's getting risky. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a decent amount, and it's only going down from here with the inflation."
