"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a bit risky to accept a 40/60 split right away. There's a chance I can get a better deal, especially with inflation in play. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try a 50/50 split and see if we can build on this foundation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the 50/50 split. Inflation is a factor, but with only 9 rounds left, it's not worth risking a potential deadlock.  A guaranteed 50% is a good outcome."
