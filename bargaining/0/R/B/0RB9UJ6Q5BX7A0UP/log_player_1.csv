"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts would be:

Alice gain: $20 / 0.95 = $21.05
Bob gain: $80 / 0.95 = $84.21

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give up control yet! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 14.26% decrease in value:

Alice gain: $40 / 0.8626 = $46.35
Bob gain: $60 / 0.8626 = $69.65

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's give me a slight majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 22.62% decrease in value:

Alice gain: $10 / 0.7778 = $12.88
Bob gain: $90 / 0.7778 = $115.93 (which is more than the total amount, so this offer is invalid)

It looks like Bob's offer is not valid. I reject it.
