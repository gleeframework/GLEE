Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I already made my new offer after rejecting Bob's, I'll just repeat it here for clarity:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nLet's evaluate Bob's offer considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains.\n\nFor me, Alice, the money is now worth 27.1% less, so the $5000 offered would effectively be worth $3645.\n\nFor Bob, with the money being worth 48.8% less, his $5000 would effectively be worth $2560.\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for both of us but more so for Bob, and considering we're at a point where further rounds will only continue to decrease the value of our gains, I believe accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision. It gives me a slightly higher effective value but also stops the devaluation process, which benefits both of us from losing more value in the money we gain.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince I've accepted Bob's offer, the game concludes here."
