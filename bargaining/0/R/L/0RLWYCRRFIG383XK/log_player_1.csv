"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting our equal contributions to this game.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $5,700 in this round.

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is more fair, especially since I made the first offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain of $5,700 in the previous round is worth 95% of its value, so it's now worth $5,415. I'll keep this in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. We're both playing the game, after all!""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
