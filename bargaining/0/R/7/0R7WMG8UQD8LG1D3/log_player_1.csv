"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something, hopefully encouraging him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I still have 10 rounds to make a better proposal.  Bob's offer is very unfair, giving him almost all of the money. I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

This offer is still advantageous to me, but I'm lowering my share a bit to make it more appealing to Bob. I'm hoping that he will be more willing to accept as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is worth significantly less due to inflation, I still have 8 rounds to make a better proposal.  Bob's offer is still quite unfair, and I can likely get a larger share if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion than Bob's offer.  The inflation is getting more significant, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the value of my share is significantly lower due to inflation, I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob's offer is still quite unfair, and I have 6 rounds left to try and secure a better deal. There's still a chance I can get a larger share if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to be more realistic. This offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's a significant improvement over his previous offers.  If he rejects, we're both risking getting nothing at this point."
