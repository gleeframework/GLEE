Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's not worth risking further inflation. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least something, and the value of my gain will only decrease further with each round."
