I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! This is a bad deal, and I'll reject it and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 80/20.  I'm still willing to share, but I need to be compensated for Bob's unreasonable offer in the previous round."
