"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he's willing to accept a modest offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $450,000
Bob gain: $450,000

Considering the offer is now 50/50, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
