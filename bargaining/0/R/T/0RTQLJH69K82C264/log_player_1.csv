"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 10% less, I think I'm getting a better deal this time.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
