"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the money is decreasing in value, so I'd like to maximize my share while still considering Bob's compromise.

I'll reject this offer for now.
