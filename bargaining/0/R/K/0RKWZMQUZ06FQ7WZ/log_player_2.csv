{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more appropriate considering the inflation that will affect our gains in the next round. Let's see what you think.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts pressure on us both. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's a better deal for me than the next round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
