While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting and proposing in the next round gives me a chance to negotiate a better deal for myself."

# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though Alice's offer has changed, it's still not a deal I'm comfortable with. The inflation is a significant factor, and I believe I can negotiate a better outcome.  I'll reject this offer and see what she proposes in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is emphasizing the time constraint and inflation, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. The inflation is affecting me significantly, and I need to ensure I get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to compromise further in the next round."
