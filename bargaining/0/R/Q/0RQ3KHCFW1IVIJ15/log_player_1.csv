"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division where I, Alice, receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. The message to Bob is, ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact."" This division slightly favors me to account for the higher rate of inflation impacting Bob's share in subsequent rounds, encouraging a fair and immediate agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation. This is a more balanced offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, Bob's offer does not sufficiently adjust for the future devaluation of the money, especially considering his share devalues at a higher rate. Accepting this offer would not be advantageous as it doesn't adequately compensate for the loss of value over time, especially since I can potentially negotiate a better split in subsequent rounds or make a counteroffer that takes into account the devaluation of money for both parties more accurately."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation on your end, this division is more reasonable.""}\n\nGiven that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, my new offer reflects the increasing devaluation, especially affecting Bob's share more significantly. By slightly increasing my share, I'm factoring in the compounded effect of inflation, making the offer more reflective of the current value of the money to both parties. This adjustment aims to encourage Bob to accept, considering the steeper decline in value he faces with continued rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer ensures we both get a reasonable share before inflation further erodes the value. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the substantial impact of inflation on both our shares, with my potential gain being worth 14.26% less and Bob's being worth 27.1% less than the initial value, accepting this offer seems prudent. The differential rate of inflation between us means that with each round, the effective value we're negotiating over decreases more sharply for Bob, but my own share is also significantly affected. Bob's offer of $5,200 for me and $4,800 for him, considering the current devaluation, presents a reasonable compromise that reflects the urgency to finalize the agreement before further value is lost to inflation. Continuing negotiations risks both of us losing more value than we could potentially gain from a slightly more favorable split."
