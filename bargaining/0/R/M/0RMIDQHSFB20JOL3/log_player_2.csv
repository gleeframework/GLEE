"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me getting 90% and you getting 10%.

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Consider that the value of the money decreases for me each round, while it remains the same for you. This is a generous offer given the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more even split is fair. I propose 85/15 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm lowering my demand to 60/40.  Accept this and we both walk away with something. Time is literally money for me in this game, and every round that passes hurts us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm lowering my proposal to 80/20. This is a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of the money for you. Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split. However, I need you to understand the urgency of the situation. My offer of 55/45 is a compromise, and I doubt I can go any lower. Let's be practical and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I also have to consider my own losses.  I'm willing to lower my proposal to 75/25. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is eating significantly into Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's 75/25 offer ensures Bob receives something.  Continuing to hold out for a better deal is increasingly risky and could result in both players walking away with nothing.
