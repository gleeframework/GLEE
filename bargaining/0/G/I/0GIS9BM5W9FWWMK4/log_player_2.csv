"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While the penalty for waiting is harsh, I have to believe I can get a better deal than that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is the best I'll offer. Let's close this deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. It's a fair split given the inflation affecting you more than me. Let's agree to this and end the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but I'm not going to fold so easily. Accepting a 40/60 split when the value is decreasing so rapidly for me would be a mistake. I need to push for a more favorable outcome while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm feeling the inflation pinch, but this offer gives us both a good chunk.  Take it now, because my offers won't get better for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've both been stubborn.  Let's split the money evenly and call it a day.  The longer we wait, the less both of us get. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as fair as it's going to get.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting even less later."
