"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the difference early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision-making accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to the low end, meet me here!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge Bob towards accepting my offer by offering him a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to your end, but not quite there 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll consider Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I can live with a 60/40 split, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. It's a decent compromise, and I'd rather settle for this than risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in future rounds."
