"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a 40% share of the original $100. I'll take the remaining 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 30 is enough, I'll wait for a better offer""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a 45% share of the original $100. I'll take the remaining 55% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want a bit for myself 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think it over:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take 75, it's a decent share""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as 75 is a relatively high share considering the inflation. I think it's better to settle for this rather than risking a worse offer in the next round."
