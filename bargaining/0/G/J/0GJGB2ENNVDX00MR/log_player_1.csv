"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I want to secure most of the money, but I'm leaving a little bit for Bob in hopes of ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and I don't want to risk losing any more money to inflation."
