"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd get 5400$ (6000 * 0.9) if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd get 4750$ (5000 * 0.95).

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a new offer that's a bit more favorable to myself, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, taking into account the 10% loss in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give in a bit more, but I think I should get a slightly larger share considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'd get 4380$ (6000 * 0.713) if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so he'd get 4340$ (5000 * 0.865).

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to justify his slightly larger share due to inflation. However, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give him a larger share, considering the initial offer was already 40% to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the significant inflation that's occurred.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give in further, I need a larger share to account for the inflation""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, taking into account the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'm trying to protect my interests and get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I think I should get a bit more considering the inflation has affected me more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so I'd get 3540$ (6000 * 0.589) if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 22.62% less, so he'd get 3850$ (5000 * 0.772).

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to justify his larger share, but I'm not convinced that he's being affected more by inflation. I'm also concerned that I'm getting a relatively small share, especially considering the initial offer was 40% to me.

However, I'm starting to think that this might be the best I can get, and I don't want to risk rejecting another offer and potentially getting an even worse deal.
