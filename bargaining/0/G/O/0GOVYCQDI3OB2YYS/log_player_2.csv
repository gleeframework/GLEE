"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I propose a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to try to reach a deal quickly. However, I believe I can negotiate a better split than 50/50. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, while still being reasonable and potentially acceptable to Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I'll aim for a bit more than half to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I think a 60/40 split is more equitable considering we're both losing value. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of a 60/40 split doesn't take into account the fact that the money is worth 36% less to me now, but it's still worth the same to her. I think there's room for a compromise that considers both our perspectives.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for me, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality while still trying to find a mutually acceptable solution. Given that the money is now worth 36% less to me, I need to prioritize getting a larger share to compensate for this loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the substantial effect of inflation on my share, I believe a 58/42 split is more reasonable at this point.""}"
