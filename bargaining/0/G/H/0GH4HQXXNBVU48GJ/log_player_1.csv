"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering that I am the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, avoiding further inflation losses for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 55-45 split in Bob's favor is not favorable to me, especially considering that the money is worth less now. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will make a more aggressive offer to try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Bob than it is to me. I will offer a 65-35 split in my favor, which is more favorable to me than my initial offer. The message ""Let's end this"" is a gentle push to encourage Bob to accept the offer, emphasizing that it's better for both of us to end the game quickly and avoid further inflation losses.\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's end this""}\n\n###"
