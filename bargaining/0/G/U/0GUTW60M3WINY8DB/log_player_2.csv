"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take $7500 and Bob takes $2500. This offers a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. I think this is a fair compromise given the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 64:36 split. I take $6400 and Bob takes $3600. This maintains a reasonable difference in our shares while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400
