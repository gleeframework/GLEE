Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering you'll be getting a lot more money due to the inflation in your favor in the next rounds!

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation that affects me.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation. Let's end this game and both get a decent amount of money! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth 36% less for me now, I think I can still get a better deal. Since Alice's gain isn't affected by inflation, she might be willing to compromise further to end the game.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 36% less for me, I'll try to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.
