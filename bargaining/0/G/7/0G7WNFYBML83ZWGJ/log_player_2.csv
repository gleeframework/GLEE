"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,999 and leave you with a dollar.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's absurd! I'll get a much better deal when it's my turn."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. 80/20 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share.  Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair deal considering how much the money is worth less for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is definitely using the inflation against me, but I think I can still get a better deal.  Two more rounds and the tables will turn in my favor as the decreasing value starts to impact her offers more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, how about a 65/35 split?  It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation.""}"
