"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90-10 split is fairer, but with a slight twist. You get the smaller share this time.  Let's see how you feel about it. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I don't like the idea of getting the smaller share, especially since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I want to make a more substantial offer, I'll aim for a 70-30 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 70-30 split. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 70-30 is a fair compromise.  Let's end this game and split the money.  I'm ready to accept your proposal from round 3, but I'm offering you a chance to get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept my own proposal from Round 3, but with a slight twist. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the money is worth less than in the previous rounds.

However, since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll take the offer to avoid further negotiations. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
