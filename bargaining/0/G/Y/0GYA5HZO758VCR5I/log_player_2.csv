"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-proposal. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share, but not that low."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a slightly more balanced split.  How about this?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still not favorable considering the inflation working against me.  I need to push for a better split soon before the value diminishes further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a split that's closer to the middle ground. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice is acknowledging the inflation, but her offer is still not addressing it adequately. I need to hold firm and hope she makes a better offer soon, even though the clock is ticking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing with every round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.  Let's end this.""}"
