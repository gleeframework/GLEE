"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'll give you a fair share, but I'll take the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90$ and Bob gets 10$. My message is a gentle way of saying that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up the majority of the money just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, no need for a big difference 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of meeting me halfway, and we can split the money evenly. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing more value."
