"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor, knowing that Bob's money is worth less than mine with each round. I'll start with a generous offer to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I am confident I can get a better deal. While his money is worth less with each round, mine is still declining as well.  I will reject this and counter with a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to stick to a 75/25 split, but this time favoring myself.  I'm hoping this offer will incentivize Bob to accept, as his money is depreciating much faster than mine."
