"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount just to get something, and this gives me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing at all."
