"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Alice is offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, suggesting a relatively fair split while also considering the impact of inflation on the money's value. Alice aims to negotiate a deal that is mutually acceptable, given the conditions of the game.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Will you accept this offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation affects you more heavily. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, considering the impact of inflation, Alice's gain of $4,500 in the second round is actually worth less than its face value due to a 20% decrease in value from the first round. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $5,500 is only decreased by 10%. Given these conditions, Alice might find the offer less favorable, especially considering her initial proposal was to take $6,000 before any inflation adjustments. Alice likely believes she can negotiate a better split in subsequent rounds or may want to adjust the proposal to better reflect the value lost due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Alice has rejected your offer. The game proceeds to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the progressive loss from inflation, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her offer to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200. Despite the money being worth less due to inflation, Alice's proposal aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money for both parties. Alice considers the fact that she is more heavily affected by inflation and tries to balance the offer accordingly.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Will you accept this offer or proceed to the next round?"
