"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with an equal split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see what Bob's proposal for an equal split looks like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather try to get a better deal than meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for an equal split just yet. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still thinking I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to getting a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit too greedy, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see what Bob's revised offer looks like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can live with this deal, it's getting harder to wait""
}
```

I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, and my patience is wearing thin. This deal seems like a decent compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid waiting for a better offer."
