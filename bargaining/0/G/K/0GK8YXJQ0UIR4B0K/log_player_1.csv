I'm going for a very aggressive strategy here! Since the money depreciates so quickly, I want to secure as much as possible in the first round.  I'll be very surprised if Bob accepts, but it's worth a shot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
