Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more balanced split, 55 for me, 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""I need to be compensated for the inflation, Bob. Let's try 65 for me and 35 for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me too, I need a bit more, 58 for me, 42 for you. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting slightly better, it's still not enough to compensate for the rapidly increasing inflation on my end. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value. I need to push for a more favorable split before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 62,
""bob_gain"": 38,
""message"": ""This is a tough negotiation Bob, but we need to reach an agreement soon. How about 62 for me and 38 for you?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards to show some flexibility, but still aiming for a larger share to offset the inflation disparity.  Bob needs to understand that time is working against me more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, 60 for me, 40 for you, let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of 40 is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
