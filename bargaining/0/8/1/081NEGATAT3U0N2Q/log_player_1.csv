"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $8,000 I would get in the first round is now worth $7,200 in the second round. 

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $4,000, which is still less than what I would have gotten in the first round ($8,000). 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, the $7,200 I would get in the second round is now worth $6,480 in the third round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500, which is a bit more than half of the remaining $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your last chance, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $8,000 I would get in the first round is now worth $5,840 in the fourth round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $4,500, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round ($8,000) and even less than what I would have gotten in the second round ($7,200). 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $8,000 I would get in the first round is now worth $5,840 in the fifth round.

However, since the money is worth 10% less than in the fourth round, the $5,840 I would get in the fourth round is now worth $5,272 in the fifth round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, meet me in the middle""
