Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and leave Bob with $1000. This ensures I get the majority of the money and still leaves Bob with something. Since there is inflation, it's best to make a quick decision and hopefully get this agreed on before the value decreases too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option in this scenario. The value of Bob's share is diminishing with each round, so he's more likely to accept a fair offer.  Holding out for more risks losing everything if he rejects and we run out of rounds."
