"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a very small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid the risk of inflation affecting his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a substantial portion for myself.  Since inflation is a factor, I'm hoping to secure a good amount before it impacts my potential gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it seems unlikely I'll get a better offer considering inflation.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
