"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous split.  I'm sure we can find a way to both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I think we can find a compromise that benefits us both more. How about this split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can find a better balance. Let's try a split that's more in line with our initial proposal.  This way, we both get a fair share of the money and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
Even with the inflation, taking $400,000 is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round.  Alice is clearly aiming for a deal heavily in her favor, and waiting any longer will only hurt my position."
