"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a potentially better offer, considering the inflation rate might pressure Alice to offer more in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is more than fair.""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will consider the impact of inflation on my end and see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a little more to get this done, Bob.  Let's call it a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer, as it doesn't take into account the inflation and is less than what I offered Alice in the previous round. I'm hoping Alice will consider the decreasing value of the money for me and make a better offer in the next rounds.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into my share. This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}\n\nI'm trying to convey a sense of urgency and firmness in my message, hoping Alice will realize that I'm not willing to compromise much further due to the increasing impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation too, Bob.  Let's split it closer to what you proposed last round, but still be fair. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's claim of feeling the pinch of inflation, her offer doesn't reflect the actual impact of inflation on my end. The value of the money I gain is decreasing significantly, and accepting 42 would be less valuable than what I could potentially get if I hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 56, ""alice_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Inflation is really hurting me now. If we don't agree soon, we'll both lose.""}\n\nI'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation, pointing out that the continued rounds are detrimental to both of us, but especially to me due to the inflation. I'm hoping Alice will see the reason in settling sooner rather than later and find this offer acceptable."
