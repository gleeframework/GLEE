"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't get a better deal than this! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $6,400 (80% of $8,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $6,000 and Bob will have $4,000. I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal than what I had initially.
