"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the high stakes. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $480,000. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the first round, but I'll assume it's $357,142.50 ($400,000 * 0.895).

I'll reject this offer since I think I can do better:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, which is $448,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I need a good reason to give up more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 45% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of what it was in the first round, which is $550,000.

I'll accept this offer since it's a fair compromise and it's getting harder to get a better deal as the rounds go by:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
