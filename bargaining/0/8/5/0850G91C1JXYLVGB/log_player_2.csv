"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get a more favorable proposal in the next round or increase my share in subsequent rounds. Let's see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering my loss due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly better than the first round, considering the 36% decrease in value for me, I'd actually be getting less value than in the initial offer. I'll take another chance to try and get a more favorable deal, hoping Alice might be willing to compromise further as the rounds continue."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We've gone back and forth, and inflation is taking its toll. Split it down the middle and let's end this.""}"
