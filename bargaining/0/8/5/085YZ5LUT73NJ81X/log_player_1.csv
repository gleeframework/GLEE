"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a good amount now, and we don't have to risk inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000
* Bob gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
