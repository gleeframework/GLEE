I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish quickly.  However, I'm aware of the inflation, so we'll see how things go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm aware of the inflation,  it's too early to accept a deal where I get only 10% of the money. I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant share. I want to show Bob I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept a more balanced deal."
