Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. It's a slight adjustment from your offer, but still fair considering the inflation. Let's get this game moving! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
