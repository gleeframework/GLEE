"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair this time. I'll take slightly more to account for the inflation, but you still get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair deal, considering the inflation. I'll take 40% of the current value of the money, which is still a decent amount."
