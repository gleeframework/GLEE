Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since the money is losing value with each round.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."

Bob is getting more and more greedy!  His offers are getting worse, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially with inflation making my money worth less each round.  I'm hoping he'll see reason and come to a more equitable agreement in the next round."
