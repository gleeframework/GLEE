"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. This is a fair offer considering the initial amount is $10,000. Since there is inflation involved, it's beneficial for both of us to conclude the game as early as possible to minimize loss of value. Given that the money loses value at a higher rate for Bob, he should be motivated to accept this offer to avoid further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob reacts to this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer seems less favorable. In the first round, the total value was $10,000, but now due to inflation, the value has decreased for both of us. Considering the devaluation rates (10% for me and 20% for Bob), and aiming to maximize my gain while still being mindful of the decreasing value of money, I believe we can find a more balanced distribution. Therefore, I reject Bob's offer and propose a new division in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the further decrease in value for both of us due to inflation. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less and mine is worth 10% less than the original, I'll adjust the proposal accordingly. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share to compensate for the higher devaluation rate he's experiencing, while still aiming for a relatively fair distribution considering the circumstances.\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust fairly""}\nI am proposing $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, with the message: ""Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust fairly"". This offer takes into account the loss of value for both parties and aims to find a middle ground that both can agree on, given the urgency to finalize the division before further devaluation occurs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for both of us due to inflation, and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I believe accepting this proposal is the best course of action. The difference in our gains is relatively small, and further rounds will only continue to devalue the money for both parties. Accepting this offer allows us to finalize the division before the value decreases any further, securing a more substantial amount than if we were to continue negotiating."
