"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer seems fair, but it might not be optimal considering the inflation factor. It gives Alice a good share and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is worse for me than the first offer, but not by a lot.  Since Bob already rejected my offer, accepting this offer seems like the best way to get some money, even if it's a bit less than I would like."
