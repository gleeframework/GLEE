"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% and leave you with 20% for now. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bold move by Bob! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining money. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer this time, Bob. Take 55% and leave me with 45% for now.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still holding out for a better deal."
