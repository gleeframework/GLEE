"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll have to think carefully about whether $63 (70 * 0.9) is enough for me to accept...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $63, I'll try to make an even better offer. Here's my next one:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more. Accept and let's end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is more than his previous offer of $30, and I'm keeping $55 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really biting now! With the 27.1% inflation, my potential gain of $55 is now worth only $40.11 ($55 * 0.727).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether $35.25 (75 * 0.467) is enough for me to accept...

Hmm... I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my next one:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and end this game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $50, which is a 50/50 split, and I'm keeping $50 for myself. This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm not leaving too much on the table due to inflation."
