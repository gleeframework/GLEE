"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the money, leaving you with 10% as a token of good faith. You can do better than this, can't you?""
}
```

I'm starting with a strong opening offer, hoping to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself. It's a fair split, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting! My 400,000$ is now worth 320,000$.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. While it's true that he's keeping a larger share, I'm not sure if it's fair considering the initial offer I made. I'll try to counter with a new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous one. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'll give you 30% and take 70% for myself. Don't try to lowball me again!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. 42% for me, 58% for you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! My 580,000$ is now worth only 296,800$.

Considering the previous offers, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. Meeting in the middle seems like a fair split, especially since I was hoping for a 70% share earlier.
