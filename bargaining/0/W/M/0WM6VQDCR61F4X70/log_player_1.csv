"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I win big. If he rejects, I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  I'll take the 50/50 split."
