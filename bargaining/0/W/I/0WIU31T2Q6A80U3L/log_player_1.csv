I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

I'm going to try and split the money more evenly this time. While inflation is a factor, I think this offer is fair. I'm willing to compromise but I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
