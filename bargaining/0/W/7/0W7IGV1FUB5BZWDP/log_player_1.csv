"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, as I know that Bob loses value at a faster rate.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even with inflation.  I'll reject and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 5500, which is still more than Bob offered me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I would have preferred more, Bob's offer is finally better than what I've been able to secure for myself in the previous rounds.  With the rapid inflation, it's time to take what I can get!"
