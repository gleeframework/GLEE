"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

My gain of $5800 is worth 80% of the original $6000 I proposed in the first round, which is a decent deal. However, I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

This way, I'll get 65% of the remaining value, while Bob gets 35%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

My gain of $6200 is worth 62% of the original $10,000, but considering the inflation, it's actually worth 62% of the original amount minus 48.8% of the original amount, which is a bit less than my original gain of $6000. However, it's still a decent deal.

Bob's gain of $3800 is worth 38% of the original $10,000, but considering the inflation, it's actually worth 38% of the original amount minus 27.1% of the original amount, which is a bit less than his original gain of $4000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
