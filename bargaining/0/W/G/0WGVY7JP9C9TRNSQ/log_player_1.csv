I'm offering to take $55 and giving Bob $45. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more equitable considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""

My offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I still want to prioritize my own gain. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
