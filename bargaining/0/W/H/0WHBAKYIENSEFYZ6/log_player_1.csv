"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a third of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
Bob's gain: 5000

Considering the inflation effect, I think I should be more cautious and try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer should take into account the reduced purchasing power of the money. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal for myself, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. Considering the effective values, my gain would be:

My gain: 4000 / 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 5493.44

Bob's gain remains the same, 6000.

I think I should accept this offer, as it's a better deal than my previous offer, considering the inflation. I'll take the 5493.44.
