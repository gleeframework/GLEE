"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give Bob a 60/40 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving Bob too much, considering the inflation factor."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to leave with only 3000, especially since it's worth significantly less than the original 5000 I proposed in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 80/20 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm running out of rounds!"

  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. This is my last chance to get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic and accept a slightly worse deal, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise."
