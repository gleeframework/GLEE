"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose an extremely lopsided deal in my favor. This is a risky strategy, but it might just work to get the money quickly. If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more generous in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
