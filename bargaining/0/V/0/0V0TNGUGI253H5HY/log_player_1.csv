# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering that I would get $40, which is 20% less than $50, I'm not sure if I should accept.

However, since I have 11 rounds left, I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better offer. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.
