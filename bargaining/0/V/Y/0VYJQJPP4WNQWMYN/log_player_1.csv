"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets 10%, or $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. 

The original $900,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $855,000. And the original $100,000 is still worth $100,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can finalize the deal""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000, which is 55% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 45%, or $450,000."
