"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give it all away.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. It's still early in the game. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $700,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $560,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it.
