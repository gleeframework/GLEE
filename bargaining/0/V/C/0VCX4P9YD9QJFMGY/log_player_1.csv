"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share of the money, but it's not unreasonable. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal or if he wants to play a more strategic game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

This offer is slightly less favorable to Alice than the first offer, reflecting the 5% inflation. It's still a significant share of the money, but it also shows that Alice is willing to compromise and is not afraid to play a longer game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than the previous round due to inflation, it's still significantly less than what Alice had proposed earlier. It's worth risking one more round to try and get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

Alice is facing significant inflation now, but she's still trying to get a larger share of the money. This offer is considerably less than her previous offers but still shows that she is willing to compromise. It's a risk, but it might be the best way to avoid getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, Bob's offer, despite inflation, is more than Alice's last proposal. It's better to accept this offer and secure a portion of the money rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
