I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting, and even though the money I would gain is worth less, I'm not going to give in so easily.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Bob needs to realize that if we keep going, the money will continue to lose value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy!  His offer is now even worse than his first one, and while the money I would gain is worth less, my pride won't let me accept it. I'll make another counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I still believe I can get a better deal than Bob's latest offer.  This time, I'm lowering my offer even further, but I'm holding onto the majority of the money."
