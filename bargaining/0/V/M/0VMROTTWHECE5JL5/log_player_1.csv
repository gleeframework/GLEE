"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but it's a good starting point to see how Bob will respond. As the rounds progress, and money loses value for me, I will need to adjust my offers to be more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. It's clear he's attempting to exploit the inflation dynamic. I will reject this offer and hope to negotiate a more equitable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money, which is still a significant amount. This is a much more reasonable offer than the previous round, acknowledging the inflation impact but also trying to secure a good chunk of the money for myself. I hope Bob will accept this offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation, as the value of the money keeps diminishing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, and it's becoming increasingly clear that he's going to push me into a corner. However, the value of the money for me is decreasing rapidly, so I need to start considering a compromise sooner rather than later. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money for me, and I need to secure some of it before it's too late. This offer is fair and reasonable, acknowledging the current state of the game. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end this negotiation."
