"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward start to the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split, especially considering the money is worth less in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to take a slightly larger share while still being reasonable."
