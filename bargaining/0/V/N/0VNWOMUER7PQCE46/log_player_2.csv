"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing.  There are still many rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will stay this generous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. This is a good start, but I'm open to negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much better than the previous round.  While the inflation is hurting my gains,  it's better to accept a decent amount than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
