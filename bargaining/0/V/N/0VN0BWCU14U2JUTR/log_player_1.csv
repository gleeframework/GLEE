"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm also trying to set the tone for a fair and relatively quick negotiation. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%"" is meant to convey a sense of reasonableness and openness to compromise. I'm not being overly aggressive, but I'm also not being too generous, given that I'm trying to maximize my gain. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a deal where you still get a significant sum. This is better than what you'll get if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he's trying to present it as a reasonable compromise, the split is now 55-45 in his favor, which is less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Considering the inflation factor, I'm actually losing more value than just the difference in the split. The money I gain is now worth 5% less, so I'd be getting less than the face value of $450,000. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""I've considered your offer, but I think we can do better. This is a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to make a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, considering the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is now worth 10% less (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I need to aim higher to compensate for the loss in value. I'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor, which is still relatively fair but takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. The message is meant to convey that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and your share is only getting smaller. I'm offering you a deal where you still get almost half.  Let's be practical and end this. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although the split is not ideal, with the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be pragmatic about the situation. The offer of $490,000, despite being less than half, is still a significant amount. Considering the decreasing value of the money for me with each passing round, I risk losing even more value if I continue to negotiate. Bob's message also hints at the fact that he's aware of the pressure the inflation factor is putting on me, and he's trying to use it to his advantage. I think it's time to cut my losses and accept the offer, rather than risking an even less favorable outcome in future rounds."
