Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I think it's fair considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still a good one.  Considering the inflation, it's better to secure a decent share now rather than risk losing more in future rounds."
