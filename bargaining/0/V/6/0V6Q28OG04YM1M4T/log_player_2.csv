Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, recognizing the impact of inflation. However,  time is on my side, and this offer is still not favorable enough. I need to hold out for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but this is still not advantageous enough considering the long game and the impact of inflation on my potential gains. I need to hold firm for now."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's compromise! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to accept.  

While the deal isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. The rapid inflation means every round significantly eats into my potential gains. Waiting any longer carries a huge risk of walking away with nothing."
