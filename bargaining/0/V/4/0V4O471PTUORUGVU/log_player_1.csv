"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. My message is to start with a small difference and see if Bob is interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a fair split, but we can adjust if needed. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 10% share. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. My message is to convey that I'm open to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share than Bob's previous offer."
