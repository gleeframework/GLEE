"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can discuss and potentially adjust the split to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the new values.

In this round, my gain of $300,000 is still $300,000, but Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $665,000.

I'm not thrilled with the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal."

}
