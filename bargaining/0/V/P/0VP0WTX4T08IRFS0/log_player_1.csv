"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more generous this time. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still keeping a decent margin to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a decent amount to make this worthwhile for me. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is still not in my favor. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to push for an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal. I'm being generous, but I need a good outcome.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm also being cautious and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a decent amount to make this worthwhile. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be careful not to give away too much. Bob's offer is a 30-70 split, which is still not in my favor. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70% share for Bob, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being very generous now. Accept this and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm also being realistic about the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to compromise and accept a 60-40 split."
