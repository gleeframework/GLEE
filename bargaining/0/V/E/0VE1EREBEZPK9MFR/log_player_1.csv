"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 90% for me, 10% for you. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about 30% for me and 70% for you? 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my gain of $700,000 is actually worth 90% of the original amount, which is $630,000. Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $240,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
