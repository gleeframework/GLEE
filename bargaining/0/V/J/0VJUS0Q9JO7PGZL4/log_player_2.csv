# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd love to get more than 50$ out of this deal! I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value due to inflation. Let's see what I can get in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, 60-40 seems fair to me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still believe I can get more than 45$, especially considering that Alice is also losing value due to inflation. I'll take the risk and see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering we're both losing value, I think 58-42 is a reasonable adjustment. I'm willing to take a bit more risk, but I'm also being realistic about the decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go back to a 50-50 split. We're both losing money rapidly, and this is the best way to maximize our gains before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the rapid loss of value due to inflation, I think accepting the 50-50 split now is the wisest decision. Further rounds will only decrease the value more, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than what I can get now. It's time to secure what I can."
