"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly. This allows for a fair starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While a 50/50 split is tempting, I'm confident I can secure a better deal in future rounds.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob's next proposal is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm proposing a 7000/3000 split, leaning in my favor slightly. This allows for a more balanced deal while still offering Bob a decent portion. I believe it's a fair proposal that Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me significantly less than I previously offered.  I'm confident I can still secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

With the value of the money decreasing, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split, which is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."
