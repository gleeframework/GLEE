"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split seems fair, and I'm willing to settle for that."
