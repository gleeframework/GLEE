Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it right away.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome. Accepting avoids further rounds and the potential for inflation to hurt my gains."
