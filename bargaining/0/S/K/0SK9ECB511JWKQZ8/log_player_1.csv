"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose that I take $999,999 and Bob takes $1. This is a very advantageous offer for me, as it allows me to maximize my share of the money. While Bob gets a tiny amount, I believe it's better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not as good as my initial offer, I'd rather take half the money than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
