"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $200,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant amount, but still leaves Bob with a substantial sum. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already losing value, and Bob's offer is even less generous than my initial one. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a more even split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly higher share, but I'm not being greedy. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste. I'll try to push for a better deal, but I'll be more cautious since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too lopsided. I need a better deal to account for the inflation.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation accelerating, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but I'll also take into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money.
