"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 5% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll analyze the new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 54,
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I still think I deserve a better share, considering the initial amount was $100. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

I'll analyze the new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 43.00,
  ""bob_gain"": 43.00,
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair considering the significant erosion of value due to inflation. I think it's time to wrap up the negotiation and finalize the deal."
