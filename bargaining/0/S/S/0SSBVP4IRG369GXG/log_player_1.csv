"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more balanced split, Alice.  This accounts for the time value of the money, given that it loses value for you with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's a good deal considering the inflation we're facing.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the inflation is a factor, Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means accepting a slightly smaller amount in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a critical point with this inflation. Let's be sensible and end this. This is a fair offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out! This is a generous offer considering the inflation is eating away at your share with every passing round. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rate, it's getting dangerous. Bob is unlikely to offer me anything better at this point. Accepting a lower offer now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
