"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While getting something is better than nothing, I'm willing to gamble that I can secure a better deal in later rounds, especially with the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split, Alice.  This accounts for the time value of the money, given that it loses value for you with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a good deal considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is playing hardball, but this offer is still not good for me. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts her, not me.  I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a critical point with this inflation. Let's be sensible and end this. This is a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the threat of inflation against me, but she's feeling the pressure more than I am.  Her offers are slowly inching closer to a more even split.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200,
