"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront, but we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I think we can find a better division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more balanced split, considering the inflation, we should both be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being more generous this time, but I won't wait forever. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer doesn't compensate enough for the loss of value over time. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal or see if Alice is willing to compromise further. The difference in the devaluation of money between us gives me some leverage to negotiate a bit more. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is affecting us differently, I think this split is more reasonable. The longer we wait, the less we both get, but I'm willing to find a middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is ridiculous, Bob. We're both losing out. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, splitting it evenly at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. Further negotiations could lead to more loss of value, so I think it's wise to accept this offer and conclude the game here.\n\n### Decision: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
