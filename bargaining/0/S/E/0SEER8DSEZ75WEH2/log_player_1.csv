"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole 100, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move to try to get the best possible outcome for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I want a bigger share!""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 40-60!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We can meet in the middle, but I'll take a slightly larger share this round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
