Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to compromise. This is a fair split, and it's the best chance for both of us to get a significant share before we lose even more to inflation. Let's not let pride get in the way of a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 500000

It's tempting to push for more, but accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth. Even if I get a slightly better deal in later rounds, inflation might eat up any potential gains.
* **Unpredictable Alice:**  Alice's offers haven't followed a completely predictable pattern.  There's no guarantee she'll offer a better deal later, and I risk walking away with nothing.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees me a significant sum, which is better than the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree."
