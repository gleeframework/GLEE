"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal.  I'm not sure a 60/40 split is fair, especially with the inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the inflation we're facing. Let's work together to make this work.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation, Bob, but the inflation is significantly impacting me. This offer is more realistic for my position. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It looks like I'm not getting a better deal, and the inflation is going to hit Alice harder. Let's end it here."
