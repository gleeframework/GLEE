5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too tilted in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor.  Consider that inflation hurts you more than me, making this a very good deal for you.",Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation difference, but your offer was still too low. I'm proposing $5700 for me and $4300 for you. This accounts for the changing value while still being a better deal for me than your previous offer.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon.  I'm proposing 52/48 in your favor. This recognizes the inflation difference while still giving me a reasonable share.  If we don't agree now, we'll both lose out significantly.",Bob,4,
