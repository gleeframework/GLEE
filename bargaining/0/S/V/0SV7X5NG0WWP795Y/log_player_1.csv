"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering we both have equal opportunity to propose in future rounds. Let's be reasonable and settle this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
