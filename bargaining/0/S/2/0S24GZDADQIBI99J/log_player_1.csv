"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, and see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,750, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best deal for me, considering the inflation adjustment. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about a 50/50 split. I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,375, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,250.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,500 is now worth $4,725, and Bob's gain of $4,500 is now worth $3,295.

I'm not sure if a 48-52 split is the best deal for me, considering the significant decrease in value of the money. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and think about my next move.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 48-52 split. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the significant inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $4,725 is now worth $4,060, and Bob's gain of $3,295 is now worth $2,840.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think I need to get a good deal considering the inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, with me getting $5,200 and Bob getting $4,800."
