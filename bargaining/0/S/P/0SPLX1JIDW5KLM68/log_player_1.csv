I'm starting with a fairly even split, but I'm leaning towards getting a larger share since I'm the one making the offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the 5% inflation means I'm only getting 95% of the value I would have gotten in the previous round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse offer in the next round."
