"Round 1
Alice's offer:

It's better to try and get more than 40% in the first round, as the inflation will affect my share in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money evenly, since we both have equal power in this game. Let's start with 60/40 for me this round, and we can adjust in the future if we want.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
The inflation is starting to bite, and although I'd like a bigger share, Alice's offer is reasonable and gets me closer to my desired outcome.  I'll take the 55% and see how the rest of the game unfolds."
