"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100 and leave 40% for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money evenly, since we both have equal power in this game. Let's start with 60/40 for me this round, and we can adjust in the future if we want. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to negotiate a 60/40 split in his favor, which is a bit more skewed than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 now (95% of $40).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll play along. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 (95% of $40).

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the $100, which is worth $38.5, and leaving 55% for Bob, which is worth $55."
