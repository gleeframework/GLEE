I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I'll take a larger share, but still leave him with a decent amount.  Let's see if he's willing to settle early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm confident that I can get more than $5,000 if I keep playing. It's risky, but the potential reward is worth the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to bridge the gap a bit from my initial offer.  While the inflation is hitting me, I think I can still secure a good portion of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy. While I'm feeling the effects of inflation, I still believe I can do better. It's a risky game, but I'm not ready to settle for less than I think I deserve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm sticking to a similar strategy as the last round â€“  offering a compromise while still aiming for a decent share. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still holding out for a deal closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out. Bob's offers are getting worse, but I'm not willing to accept such a low amount. I'll keep fighting for a better deal. The risk of getting nothing is high, but the potential reward is still worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm realizing I might not get my initial desired amount. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair considering the circumstances. It's a risky move, but I need to find a way to secure something before it's too late."
