Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation rate is already impacting my potential gains, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing."
