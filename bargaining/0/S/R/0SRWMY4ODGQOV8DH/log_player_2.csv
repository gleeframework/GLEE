"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk as well.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but I still need a better deal than that. Let's split it more evenly this time.  
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of the money.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the money is literally evaporating. This is my final offer, a 60/40 split.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. While ideally, I'd want a larger share,  this offer gives a clear signal that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal while acknowledging the time constraint and rapid devaluation.  Alice is incentivized to accept as any further delay will hurt her more than me."
