"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a pretty good deal for Bob, considering he gets something. I'm hoping he'll take it and we can both move on with our lives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though he's giving me more than in the first round,  it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 7000/3000 split. While Bob still gets a decent chunk of the money, I'm taking a more aggressive stance. I'm confident I can secure a good portion of the money, given that he rejected my previous offer and the inflation rate is likely making his share less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. Although his share is getting bigger due to inflation, mine is not increasing at all. I am confident I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm proposing an 8000/2000 split. With each round, inflation is making Bob's share less and less valuable. I'm taking advantage of that by offering him a smaller portion than in previous rounds. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept and avoid further rounds."
