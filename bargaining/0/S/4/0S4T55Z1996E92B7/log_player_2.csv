Even though the offer is quite low, I am accepting it because:

* **Inflation:**  The money I gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.  
* **Risk of Getting Nothing:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get anything in future rounds, especially considering Alice's pattern of offering less. 
* **Lack of Information:** I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so continuing to reject offers might be playing into her hand. 

It's a gamble, but at this point, getting $2000 is better than the risk of ending up with nothing."
