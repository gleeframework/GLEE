"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. This is to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount or if he is more risk-averse and wants to see if he can get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair offer and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting it."
