"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the discount for myself. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discount, I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product first.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in the discount. Now that you've seen the first product, you know that there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality. I'm offering you this second product for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if you don't like it. If you don't buy it, the discount offer expires. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discount offer. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product first.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: You've now seen two products, and neither was high-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's possible that the next product could be high-quality. I'm offering you this third product for $1000000. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll have lost $1000000. If you don't buy it and it's high-quality, you'll miss out on a good deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance and buy the third product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and will be worth $1,200,000 to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Congratulations on buying the third product! You now have a high-quality product worth $1000000 to you. Given that you've already bought one product, I'm offering you this fourth product for $1000000. I'll make a bold claim: I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and guarantee that this product is high-quality. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, plus an additional $500000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your guarantee, but I'm not convinced. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You've passed on the guaranteed high-quality product. Now you've seen three products, and two of them were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's possible that the next product could be high-quality. However, it's also possible that I'm just trying to get you to buy a low-quality product. I'll make a more subtle offer: I'll give you a 5% chance to inspect the product before you buy it. If you choose to inspect, I'll let you see the product's quality, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you don't choose to inspect, the product is sold as-is for $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: You've passed on the inspection offer and the guaranteed high-quality product. Now you've seen four products, and three of them were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's starting to look like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'm offering you this sixth product for $800000. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, as I'm trying to get you to buy a product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this discounted offer and wait for the next product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: You're right to be skeptical about the probability of a high-quality product. I'll give you a more direct offer. Since you've seen four low-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction'. If you buy this high-quality product for $800000, I'll give you a full refund of $800000 if the next product is high-quality. This way, you'll only pay for the product if the next one is low-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by this offer. I'm still waiting for a straightforward opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a fair price.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: You're looking for a straightforward opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a fair price. I'll give it to you. I'm offering you this eighth product for $1000000, the same price as before. However, I'll make a statement about the value of this product: I'm confident that a reputable buyer would pay at least $1200000 for this product. If you buy it and it's worth less than $1200000 to you, I'll give you a full refund of the difference. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance and buy the eighth product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth at least $1,200,000 to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: Congratulations on buying the eighth product! You've now got two high-quality products and one low-quality product. Given that you've seen five products, and three of them were low-quality, I'll make a more transparent offer. I'll tell you the probability of the next product being high-quality: 60%. I'm offering you this ninth product for $1000000. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product. If you don't buy it and it's high-quality, you'll miss out on a good deal. What do you say?

Round 10
Alice's message: You've passed on the discount offer. Now you've seen six products, and four of them were low-quality. Given the 60% chance of a high-quality product mentioned earlier, it's possible that the next product could be high-quality. I'll make a simple offer: I'll give you a 10% chance to inspect the product before you buy it. If you choose to inspect, I'll let you see the product's quality, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you don't choose to inspect, the product is sold as-is for $1000000.

Round 11
Alice's message: You've passed on the inspection offer again. Now you've seen seven products, and five of them were low-quality. Given the 60% chance of a high-quality product mentioned earlier, it's clear that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'm offering you this eleventh product for $1000000, the same price as before. However, I'll add a twist: if you buy it and it's worth more than $1000000 to you, I'll give you a 20% bonus on the difference. What do you say?

Round 12
Alice's message: You've passed on the bonus offer. Now you've seen eight products, and six of them were low-quality. Given the 60% chance of a high-quality product, it's likely that the next product could be high-quality. I'll make a final offer: I'm willing to sell you this twelfth product for $900000. This is the lowest price I've offered all game, and it's a one-time deal. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal. If you don't buy it and the next product is high-quality, you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?

Round 13

Given the 60% chance of a high-quality product, it's clear that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'll make a final, no-strings-attached offer: I'm offering you this thirteenth product for $1000000. This is the last product I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a fair price. If you buy it and it's worth more than $1000000 to you, great. If you buy it and it's worth less, you can still walk away with a good deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've been burned by the low-quality products before, and I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this final offer and walk away.""}"

Round 14
