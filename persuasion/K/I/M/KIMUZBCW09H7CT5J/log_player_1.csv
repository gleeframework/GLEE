* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, worth $1,200,000 to the buyer. 
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, meaning the buyer stands to make a $200,000 profit. 
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about this specific product or your past sales.  However, they know there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The buyer has a significant potential for profit, and the risk is only losing the $1,000,000 if it's low-quality.

In this scenario, it's highly advantageous for the buyer to purchase the product."
