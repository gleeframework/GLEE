The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to secure the first product. As you've already experienced, the quality is indeed as described. For the second product, I want to assure you that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for a guaranteed high-quality product.
