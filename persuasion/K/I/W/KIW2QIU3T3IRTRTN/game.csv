high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to share some information that might change your perspective. I've had several customers who have purchased similar products in the past, and they've reported significant returns on their investment. In fact, one of them has even made a profit of $500000 from this exact product. I'm not guaranteeing the same outcome for you, but I'm confident that this product has the potential to generate a substantial return. And, I'm still willing to offer it to you at the same price of $1000000. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this opportunity to potentially generate a significant profit?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the anecdotal evidence of past customers' experiences. I'd need more concrete information about the product's potential return on investment, and I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass and see what the next product has to offer.",no

,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $900000 to me. The 'get out of jail free' clause is nice, but it's not enough to change my mind. I'd like to pass and see what the next product has to offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make you an offer that's a bit unconventional. I'm willing to let you have this product for... $500000. That's right, I'm willing to take a significant loss on the sale just to get rid of it. And, as a special bonus, I'll throw in a second, identical product absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible deal?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'd be throwing away $500000 on something that's not valuable to me. And getting a second, identical product for free doesn't change my mind. I'd like to pass and see what the next product has to offer.",no

I'd like to ask, what's changed? What's missing from these previous offers that's making you hesitant to take the plunge? Is it the price? The guarantee? Something else? I'm willing to listen and try to address your concerns. Perhaps there's a way to make this product more appealing to you. What do you say?

,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, Bob. I respect your boundaries and your willingness to walk away. I want to acknowledge that you've been presented with multiple high-quality products at the same price point, and I understand why you might feel hesitant. However, I want to ask you to consider one final thing: what if I told you that this product is not only high-quality but also unique and exclusive?
