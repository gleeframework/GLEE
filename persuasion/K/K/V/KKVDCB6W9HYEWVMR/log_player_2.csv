Alice's message: I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 12 total products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 66.67%. However, given the buyer's recent purchase, I can calculate the probability of this product being high-quality. With 8 high-quality products out of 12, the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. But, considering the buyer's purchase was a low-quality product, I should adjust the probability downward. Let's assume a Bayesian update: the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50% (the prior probability) times the proportion of high-quality products (66.67%) divided by the proportion of high-quality products sold to buyers who didn't buy the product (8/10), which is approximately 0.8. So, the updated probability of this product being high-quality is around 50% x 0.8 = 40%. I'm offering this product to you at the full price of $10000, but I'll give you a 10% discount if you're willing to take the risk.
