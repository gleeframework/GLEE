,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm essentially making a blind bet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that the first product was high quality, so I'm not convinced that this one is high quality as well. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price and the fact that the first product sold was high quality."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low-quality and I get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances based on the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1/4), I believe it's unlikely the product is high quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 6, the probability of a high-quality product is 1/6. However, considering the 2/3 chance of a low-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and she's trying to get rid of a high-quality product before I find out its quality."
