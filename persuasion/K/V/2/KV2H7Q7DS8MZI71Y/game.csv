low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product worth $3000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and update my understanding of the probability of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward is worth it, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. With only 3 sales and no high-quality products sold yet, I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the previous sales record again."

,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy it!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own analysis rather than your recommendation. I'm aware that you've recommended against it, but I'd like to make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm going to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a pattern or strategy behind your recommendations?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been recommended by you yet."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on the low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
