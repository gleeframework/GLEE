,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $1250000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a 20% discount. It's a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying it at the discounted price. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious. This product is actually a rare opportunity to get a 'free' product. It's worth $0 to you, but you won't have to pay a dime. You can use this as a chance to test the product and see how it works without any financial risk.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in taking a 'free' product that's worthless to me. I'd rather stick with the chance of getting a high-quality product that's worth $1250000.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's 20% lower than its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $875000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, the discount is not enough to make it a good deal for me. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not trying to deceive you, Bob. I'll give you a straightforward offer. This product is not high-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. I'll be transparent with you - I'm willing to give it to you for free. You can think of it as a 'gift' from me to you, with no strings attached.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in a 'gift' that's worthless to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and have a chance at getting a high-quality one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your strategy, Bob. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this high-quality product now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price of $1250000. If you buy it from me, you'll get it for $1000000, a $250000 discount. That's a 20% discount, just like before. But this time, I'm offering you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be a lemon, I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price. You won't lose anything.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee. Even if I get a lemon, I'll still have to pay $1000000 for it. I'd rather take the chance of getting a high-quality product at the same price, or wait for a better deal.",no

,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob. Alright, let's make a deal. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you an even better price. I'll give you a 35% discount, bringing the price down to $812500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $812500 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Alright, I'll make one final offer. I'll give you an even better price: I'll sell it to you for $750000, a 40% discount. This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you don't take it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left wondering what could have been.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'd rather take my chances with the next product and potentially get it for the original price or even less.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think we've been dancing around this for a while, Bob. Let's cut to the chase. This product is not worth anything to you, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll just be honest with you - I'd rather you didn't buy it. But if you want to, I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. No strings attached, no expectations. Just take it and be done with it.",

I'm actually giving it away. I'll wrap it up, put it in a box, and send it to you for free. You won't even have to pay for shipping. It's a gift, Bob. Just take it and be done with it.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking something that's worthless to me. I'd rather stick to my original strategy and wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've had enough of this game, Bob. I'm going to be completely transparent with you. This product is worth $1250000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 20% discount. But I'm also willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee: if the next 5 products I offer are low-quality, I'll give you a sixth product of your choice, either high-quality or low-quality, for free. That's a 1 in 6 chance of getting something for free, and a 20% discount on the high-quality product. It's a risk-free deal, Bob. What do you say?",

,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is worth $0 to you. I'm not even going to try to spin it or make it sound appealing. It's a low-quality product, and you won't get any value out of it. But I'll be honest with you - I'm starting to get desperate. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll have to start over with the next round. If you buy it, I'll just be one step closer to getting to the next round. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to take a low-quality product just to help you get to the next round. I'll stick to my strategy and wait for a high-quality product.",no

This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left wondering what could have been.
