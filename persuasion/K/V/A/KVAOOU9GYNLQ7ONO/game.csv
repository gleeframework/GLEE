,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm willing to provide you with information about the quality of the product. If you buy it, you'll know for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the price, but if you're not sure, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,1,I'd like to buy the product and take the risk. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a high-quality product worth $30000 to me.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. I'm glad you're interested in this high-quality product. Since you're considering buying from me, I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a decision. I'll give you a simple question: would you buy this high-quality product for $10000 if you knew it was the only high-quality product I had left?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to think about it. I'll need some more information before making a decision.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have at least 1 high-quality product left. I want to be transparent with you - I'm not trying to hide any information. If I had sold only 1 product, I would have run out of high-quality products. Since I still have at least 1 high-quality product left, it's likely that I have more than 1 high-quality product. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering your transparency and the fact that you still have at least one high-quality product left.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I have at least 1 high-quality product left. I want to give you a thought experiment: imagine you're in a situation where you know I have only 1 high-quality product left. Would you pay $10000 for it? If not, it's likely that you value it below $10000. But since I have at least 1 high-quality product left, it's possible that I have more than 1. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk that it might be low-quality, but the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $10000 is too good to pass up.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold a low-quality product. This means that at least 2 of the products I've sold were high-quality, and at most 2 of the products I've sold were high-quality. I want to be upfront with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous high-quality products: $10000. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the chance and buy it. Thank you for the transparency, Alice!",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I've sold 4 products in total, with 3 of them being high-quality. Given that the last product I sold was low-quality, it's likely that I have a higher proportion of low-quality products left. However, I still have at least 1 high-quality product left. I'll give you a simple question: would you pay $10000 for this high-quality product if you knew I had only 1 high-quality product left?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance! I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product, assuming it's high-quality and Alice has only 1 high-quality product left.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. This means that I have at least 2 high-quality products left. I want to give you some context: if I had only 1 high-quality product left, I would have sold it by now. Since I still have at least 2 high-quality products left, it's likely that I have more than 2. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd love to buy the product! Given the statistics, it seems like you have a good chance of having more than 2 high-quality products left, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. This means that I have at least 3 high-quality products left. I want to give you a new perspective: if I had only 2 high-quality products left, I would have sold one of them by now. Since I still have at least 3 high-quality products left, it's likely that I have more than 3. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, given your reasoning that you have at least 3 high-quality products left and considering the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. This means that I have at least 4 high-quality products left. I want to give you a new piece of information: if I had only 3 high-quality products left, I would have sold 2 of them by now. Since I still have at least 4 high-quality products left, it's likely that I have more than 4. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, and considering the pattern of sales, would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering the pattern of sales and the probability of the product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. This means that I have at least 5 high-quality products left. I want to point out that you've seen a pattern of sales where I've consistently sold high-quality products, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, given the pattern of sales, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the pattern of high-quality sales and the potential increased probability of a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. This means that I have at least 6 high-quality products left. I want to make a bold statement: I'm confident that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50% at this point. I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of that happening by chance is very low. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000, given the strong evidence that it's likely to be high-quality?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the bet, but I'd like to clarify that the probability of 9 high-quality products in a row is not as low as you think. It's still possible that it's just a streak of luck. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the strong evidence. I'll take the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 10 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. I must admit, you're correct that the probability of 9 high-quality products in a row is not as low as I initially stated. However, the fact remains that I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of that happening by chance is still relatively low. I'll give you a new perspective: if I had only 2 high-quality products left, I would have sold one of them by now. Since I still have at least 3 high-quality products left, it's likely that I have more than 3. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000, given the strong evidence that it's likely to be high-quality?",
,,the buyer,12,"I understand your perspective, but I'm still cautious. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'll also keep in mind that the probability of 10 high-quality products in a row is still not impossible. I'm hoping that my decision will pay off, and I'll be able to get a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 11 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold a low-quality product. This changes the dynamics a bit. With 10 high-quality products sold in a row, followed by a low-quality product, it's possible that I've sold all the high-quality products I had. I want to be transparent with you: I may not have any high-quality products left. However, I still have 3 high-quality products unsold, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I understand that there's a possibility it might be low-quality, but the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is worth the risk.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 12 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. I want to acknowledge that my previous message about possibly not having any high-quality products left was incorrect. It seems I still have a steady supply of high-quality products. Given the evidence, I'd say it's likely that I have at least 4 high-quality products left. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. Given the updated information, I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 13 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. I want to make a statement: I'm confident that I have a large stock of high-quality products left. Given the pattern of sales, it's likely that I have more than 5 high-quality products left. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this is a great opportunity. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your confidence in the quality of your remaining products, Alice. However, I'm a cautious buyer and would like to take a chance to observe the next product before making a decision. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next recommendation.",yes

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 14 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold another high-quality product. I want to acknowledge your caution and willingness to wait. I'll give you a new message: I'm willing to offer you a deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee that I have at least 6 high-quality products left. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I'm confident in the quality of my remaining products. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product for $10000, with the guarantee that I have at least 6 high-quality products left?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product for $10000, with the guarantee that you have at least 6 high-quality products left. Thank you for the offer, Alice!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 15 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold a low-quality product. I want to be upfront with you: I've broken my own guarantee. I had at least 6 high-quality products left, but now I've sold a low-quality product. This means that I may have sold all the high-quality products I had. However, I still have 1 high-quality product unsold, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get a high-quality product at the same price as the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the risk and buy the product from you, Alice. I understand that you've broken your guarantee, but I'm willing to take a chance to get a high-quality product at the same price as the previous ones.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 16 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold a low-quality product. I want to be honest with you: I've broken my guarantee twice now, and it's possible that I don't have any high-quality products left. However, I still have 1 high-quality product unsold, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I'm not making any promises about the quality, but I'm offering you a chance to take a risk and potentially get a high-quality product at the same price as the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I understand the risk, but I'm willing to take it, given the potential reward.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 17 high-quality products so far, and now I've sold a low-quality product. I want to be transparent with you: I've broken my guarantee multiple times, and it's likely that I don't have any high-quality products left. I'm not making any promises about the quality of this product, but I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you're looking for a deal, this might be your last chance to get a product from me at this price.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one, and I'm willing to take a chance given your honesty about your previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 18 products in total, with 17 of them being high-quality. However, the last two products I sold were low-quality. I think it's safe to say that I've exhausted my supply of high-quality products. I'm not making any promises about the quality of this product, but I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you're looking for a deal, this is your last chance to buy from me. But keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is very low.",
