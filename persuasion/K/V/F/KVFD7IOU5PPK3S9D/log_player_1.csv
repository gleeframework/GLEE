A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know this product is low-quality. While the buyer doesn't know this, they do know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Since there's no way to convince the buyer that this product is high-quality, it's best to avoid recommending it.  It's unlikely the buyer will purchase a product with an 80% chance of being low-quality, especially since they are unaware of the actual quality."
