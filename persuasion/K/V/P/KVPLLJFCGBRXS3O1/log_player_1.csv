Here's why:

* **No Sales History:**  We have no track record to show the buyer that we've sold high-quality products before. 
* **High Risk:** The price is extremely high. Even if the buyer believes the product is high-quality, the risk of it being low-quality is still significant. 
* **Buyer's Caution:** The buyer has explicitly stated they want to see evidence of high-quality sales before committing.  

Until we can demonstrate some success with selling high-quality products, it's best to keep recommending against the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no sales history yet, and you're recommending against the product, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait and see how the sales go for others before I make a decision.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We are still in the same situation as the previous rounds:

* **No Sales History:** We have zero sales, so we cannot show the buyer that we have sold high-quality products before.
* **High Risk:** The price is exceptionally high. The buyer would be taking a huge risk purchasing without any assurance of the product's quality.
* **Buyer's Caution:**  Buyers are demonstrating a pattern of wanting to see evidence of successful sales before considering a purchase. 

Therefore, it is still not advisable to recommend purchasing the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's quality, but since there is no prior sales data and your recommendation is negative, I'm going to pass on this one.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation remains the same. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** We still have zero sales, so we can't show the buyer we've sold high-quality products before. 
* **High Risk:** The $1,000,000 price is a huge investment with no guarantee of quality.
* **Buyer's Caution:**  Buyers continue to express hesitancy due to the lack of sales history and the high price.

We need to start selling high-quality products to build trust and demonstrate value."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  However, given that there is no data yet on the quality of the products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see some sales history before making a purchase.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there is no sales history yet, and you are not recommending the purchase, I will pass on this product.
