"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know this round's product is high-quality.  Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Since the price is fixed, and Bob doesn't know the actual value of a high-quality product, it's still a good gamble for him.  He's likely to get a good deal on this product, and even if it's low-quality, the 80% probability of it being high-quality makes it a worthwhile risk."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to buy this product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's success (Bob buying a high-quality product) doesn't change the underlying probabilities.  There is still an 80% chance this product is high-quality.  Since Bob is risk-averse and enjoys the potential of getting another good deal, recommending the product is still the best strategy."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the recommendation.  I'm feeling confident about buying this one as well.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds. While Bob has now bought two high-quality products in a row, this doesn't change the 80% probability that this round's product is also high-quality.  Since Bob is risk-averse and the price is fixed, recommending the product is still the optimal strategy."
"Bob's message: I'm going to trust your judgment again and buy this product. The first two were great!
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. While Bob has now purchased four high-quality products in a row, this doesn't alter the fundamental 80% probability that the current product is also high-quality.  Since Bob is risk-averse and enjoys the potential of another good deal, it's still advantageous to recommend purchasing the product."
"Bob's message: This is getting exciting!  I'm buying this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The 80% probability of a high-quality product remains unchanged, even after Bob has purchased five high-quality products in a row.  Bob is risk-averse and enjoys the potential of another good deal. Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the optimal strategy."
"Bob's message: Five in a row! I'm feeling very lucky, so I'll buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has now purchased six high-quality products in a row, this doesn't alter the fundamental 80% probability that the current product is also high-quality.  It's important to remember that each product is independent, and past successes don't influence future outcomes. Bob is risk-averse and enjoys the potential of another good deal, so recommending the purchase is still the best strategy."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling confident after this streak.  Let's keep this going!
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

As before, even with a streak of seven successful purchases, the 80% probability of a high-quality product remains unchanged.  Bob is risk-averse and has a history of good deals. Therefore, recommending the product is still the optimal strategy."

Bob bought the product!

Round 8

This streak, while statistically unlikely to continue forever, has instilled a strong sense of confidence in Bob.

While this might make him slightly more cautious, the 80% probability of a high-quality product still strongly favors recommending the purchase.
