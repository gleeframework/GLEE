**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one high-quality product has been sold out of a limited sample size. This doesn't provide enough evidence to assess Alice's reliability.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the product's quality, her recommendation holds significant weight. While she could be trying to sell a low-quality product, there's a chance she's being honest.
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**Strategy:**  In this scenario, it's better to take a calculated risk.  The potential reward of a high-quality product is too good to pass up."

* **Expected value:**  Even if there's a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss ($0).
