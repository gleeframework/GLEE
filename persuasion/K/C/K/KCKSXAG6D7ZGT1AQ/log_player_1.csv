}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the product at the listed price. I'm interested in the potential for a lower price on the next product, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at full price.

I'll give you a 90% chance to buy the next product at $500000, and a 10% chance to buy it at $250000. If you buy the next product, I'll reveal its quality after your decision. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the pattern of the last two products doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the next one.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by the pattern. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I don't want to pay $500000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision.
