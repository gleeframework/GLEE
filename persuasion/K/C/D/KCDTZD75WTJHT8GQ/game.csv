I think it's a great opportunity to get in on the action. The price remains the same at $1000000. Are you ready to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm doing it because I think the odds are slightly in my favor. With 4 high-quality products out of 12, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm also considering the fact that I'm the 8th buyer, and I'm hoping that the law of large numbers will start to kick in.

,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm still cautious. With only 1 high-quality product out of 8 sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/8. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 8. Using Bayes' theorem, I calculate the posterior probability as (1/8) / (1/2) = 1/4. With this updated probability, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.",yes
