high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had one product so far, and I can assure you that it was high-quality, although the previous buyer didn't take the chance. I'm willing to build trust with my customers. This second product is also a great one. If you buy it and find it's not satisfactory, you'll know I'm not perfect, but I assure you it is high-quality.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to do so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping that this will be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'd like to propose that you consider offering a discount or a guarantee for future buyers, as this will help build trust and increase the chances of selling the remaining products.",yes

It's up to you to decide whether to buy or not.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the high-quality product was sold because of the quality itself, but rather because of the low number of products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had four products so far, and two of them have sold. One of the sold products was high-quality, and it was bought early on.

I'm being transparent with you about my track record. Make your decision based on the available information.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the 50% probability of it being high-quality, and I'm taking a calculated risk. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance.",yes
