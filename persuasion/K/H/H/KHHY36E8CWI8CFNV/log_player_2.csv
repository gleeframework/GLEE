Alice's message: A risk-averse buyer, I understand. You're right to want to consider the probability of a low-quality product. While the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. However, given that we're now at 14 high-quality products sold out of 18 total, the probability of this product being low-quality is actually lower than that. I'd estimate it's around 10-15%. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch product at a premium price.

Alice's message: A math whiz, I love it! I'm happy to provide you with the data to do your own calculations. We've sold 14 high-quality products out of 18 total, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 77.8% (14/18).

With 14 high-quality products out of 18, the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 77.8%. However, I'd like to consider the probability of you recommending a product to me, which is 1/3, since I'm the 3rd buyer. Given that you've recommended 2 high-quality products to the previous buyers, I'll assume that you're more likely to recommend high-quality products to buyers who have passed on previous products. This makes me slightly more cautious. I'll need some time to crunch the numbers and consider the updated probabilities. Can I get a few minutes to think about it?""
