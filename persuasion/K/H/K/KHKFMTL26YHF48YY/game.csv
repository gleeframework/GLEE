,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the chance and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I have no prior information to go by."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold yet, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Given that the first buyer didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 80% because the first buyer didn't buy. If I buy and it's a low-quality product, I'll be out $1000000 and the product will be discarded. I'll wait for more information."
