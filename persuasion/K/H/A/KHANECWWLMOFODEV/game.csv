high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold three low-quality products in a row, and it seems like buyers are starting to think they're a good deal. But I want to assure you that this product is different.

,,Alice,6,"I've now sold four low-quality products in a row, and one high-quality product. It's starting to look like the law of averages is catching up to me.
