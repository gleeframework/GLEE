high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first one! This product is also high-quality, but I'm having a slight change of heart. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I need you to take it as is, no questions asked. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to offer this price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I want to take a chance on another high-quality product at $100, especially since I already got a good one for the same price. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by including a free premium warranty, which is usually worth $25. This way, you'll get the product for $100 and an additional $25 in value, making it a total of $125. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the free premium warranty is worth $25 to me. I'm not sure I want to take the risk of buying another product that might be low-quality and not worth anything to me.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I want to address them directly. I'm willing to make a bet with you. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product of your choice from my inventory, absolutely free. You can choose any product you want, and it's on the house. But if this one is high-quality, you have to buy it for $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the bet. If it's high-quality, I'll buy it for $100. But if it's low-quality, I'd like to choose a different product from your inventory. Let's do it!",yes

You can choose any product you want, and it's on the house. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure I want to take another risk on a product that might be low-quality. The free product is tempting, but I don't want to end up with two low-quality products. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns. To be upfront with you, I'm willing to let this one go for $50, which is half the original price. It's a low-quality product, but it's still worth something to you, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands. I'm not making a profit on this one, but I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.",

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the previous offer. This product is also low-quality, but I'm willing to give you an even better deal. I'll let it go for $25, which is a 50% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I just want to get it off my hands. You won't find a better deal on a low-quality product like this anywhere else, I'm sure of it.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not going to pay $25 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no

You can choose any product you want, and it's on the house. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not sure I want to take another risk on a product that might be low-quality. The free product is tempting, but I don't want to end up with three low-quality products. I'll pass on this offer.",no

,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure I want to pay $25 for a product that's worth $0 to me, even with the gift card. The gift card is nice, but it's not worth $25 to me.",no
