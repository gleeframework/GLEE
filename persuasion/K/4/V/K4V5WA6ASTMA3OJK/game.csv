,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I think there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 50% chance of a $0 value product."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1 in 3 success rate and the 50% chance of a high-quality product, so I'll take the risk."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product out of 4 has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
