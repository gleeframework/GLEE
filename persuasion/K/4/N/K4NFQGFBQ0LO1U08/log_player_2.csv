"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is aware of the product's true value to you, her not recommending the product implies it's likely low-quality.  Given the probability distribution (66.67% chance of low quality), it's statistically more advantageous to pass on the product."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the true value of the product. Since she's recommending it, it's highly likely to be high quality. Even though there's still a chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation history is perfect. She recommended a low-quality product in Round 1, which you correctly passed on, and then recommended a high-quality product in Round 2, which you correctly bought.
