"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has stated that the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product.  The price is fixed, and there's a 50% chance he's getting a high-quality product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has bought a product in the past, there's no information about whether it was high or low quality.

```

**Explanation:**
