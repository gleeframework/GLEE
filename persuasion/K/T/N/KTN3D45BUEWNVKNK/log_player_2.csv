Alice's message: I understand that the lack of sales records might make it hard to trust me, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products. Although I haven't made a sale yet, I'm eager to change that with you. I believe this product has value, and I'm willing to stand behind it.

Alice's message: I see a pattern here - buyers are hesitant due to the lack of sales data. I want to break this cycle with you! I've had three previous products that didn't sell, but that doesn't mean this one won't meet your expectations. In fact, I'm more confident than ever that this product is worth your investment. I'm not asking you to take a blind leap of faith, but rather to consider the possibility that this product could be the one that changes the statistics. Will you be the one to take the chance?

Alice's message: I'll be honest with you - I've had four previous products that didn't sell, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I want to make a sale and prove that I can deliver value. While I understand that the odds are still against me, I'm willing to assure you that I'm doing everything in my power to provide a good product. If you're feeling lucky, take a chance on me. Who knows, you might be the one to turn my luck around!

Alice's message: I'm starting to think that being transparent about my struggles might not be the best approach. Let me try something different. Instead, I want to focus on the value that this product could bring to you. It's priced at $100, and I truly believe it has the potential to be worth that and more. I know the odds are against me, but I'm willing to take the risk that you'll be satisfied. Will you take a chance on me and this product?

Alice's message: I've had seven previous products that didn't sell, and I'm starting to think that I need to change my approach. Instead of asking you to trust me, I want to ask you to think about the probability of me having two high-quality products in a row. It's unlikely, but not impossible. What if I told you that I'm more confident about this product than any of the previous ones? Would that change your mind?

Alice's message: I've been thinking, and I want to try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the product itself, I want to focus on the value of taking a chance. Think about it this way: if you don't take a chance on this product, you'll never know what could have been. But if you do take a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised. I know the odds are against me, but I'm willing to take that risk with you. Are you?

Alice's message: I must say, I'm impressed by the previous buyer's rational approach. I want to acknowledge that the expected value calculation is a valid way to look at this purchase. However, I'd like to ask you to consider something else: what if I'm on the verge of a streak of good luck? What if the next product I sell is high-quality, and the one after that, and the one after that? You could be the one who gets in on the ground floor of a winning streak. I know it's a long shot, but I'm willing to take that chance with you. Are you willing to join me?

Alice's message: I think I've been trying too hard to spin the odds in my favor. Let me take a step back and just be honest with you. This product might be worth $0 to you, and it might be worth something more. I don't know, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. What I do know is that I need to make a sale, and I'm willing to take the risk that you'll be unhappy with the product.
