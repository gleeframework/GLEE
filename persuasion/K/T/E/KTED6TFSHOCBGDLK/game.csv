low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I don't know its quality yet, but I'll tell you at the end of the round. If you buy, you'll get a product that is either high-quality or low-quality. If you don't buy, I'll keep trying to find a high-quality product. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You bought a low-quality product in the first round, and now you've bought a high-quality product in the second round. This suggests that my initial product was just a fluke, and I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I know this one is high-quality, but I'm not sure how much you value it. I'm willing to give you some information to help you make a decision. I'll tell you that if you buy this product, I'll offer you a third product that is also high-quality, but with a 50% chance of being the same product you just bought. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's valuable to me and that the third product will be different from the one I just bought.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've now bought two products, one of which is high-quality. I'll give you some more information to help you make a decision about the third product. Since you bought the second product, I'll assume that you value it at least $10000, since that's the price I was asking. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I know this one is low-quality, and I'm willing to give you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a fourth product that is guaranteed to be different from the two you already have, and it will be high-quality with a 50% probability. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for a high-quality one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've passed on the low-quality product, which is good on you! I'll keep trying to find a high-quality product for you. Since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a hint: I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, and I've already offered you two high-quality products. I'm not sure what the next product will be, but I'll tell you that I have at least one more high-quality product left. I'm offering you another product for $10000. If you buy this one, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have, so you'll know what to expect. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and that the next product you have is also high-quality.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've bought another product, and it's high-quality! I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have: it's also high-quality. You now have three high-quality products, and I have one more high-quality product left. I'm offering you the last high-quality product for $10000. If you buy this one, you'll have four high-quality products, and I'll be out of high-quality products. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep trying to find a high-quality product, but it might take a while. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the last high-quality product. I want to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product and I'm willing to pay the price.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've bought the last high-quality product, and now you have four high-quality products. I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll be honest with you, I've already offered you five products, and only two of them were high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to give you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a chance to buy the next product I have at a price of your choice, up to $10000. This way, you can get a good deal on a potentially high-quality product. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in buying a product with a lower probability of being high-quality. I'll pass and wait for a chance to buy the next product at a price of my choice.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've passed on the product with a lower probability of being high-quality, and now I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll give you a hint: the probability of this product being high-quality is still lower than 33.33%, but it's not as low as the previous product. Since you're willing to wait for the next product at a price of your choice, I'll give you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you the next product at a price that is 50% of what I would have asked for it if you had bought it at the standard price of $10000. Think carefully before making your decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've passed on the product again, and now I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll give you a hint: I've already offered you 8 products, and only 3 of them were high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still lower than 33.33%. However, I'll make you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a chance to buy the next product at a price that is 75% of what I would have asked for it if you had bought it at the standard price of $10000. This is the last chance to get a discount on a product that might be high-quality. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not willing to take a chance on a product with a lower probability of being high-quality, even with a discounted price. I'll pass and wait for the next product at a price of my choice.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've passed on the product again, and now I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll give you a hint: you've already passed on 7 products, and only 4 of them were low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll make you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a chance to buy the next product at a price of your choice, up to $10000. This is a one-time offer, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product at a price you set. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and I'll have the chance to set the price for the next product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've bought the product, and it's high-quality! Now, you have the chance to set the price for the next product. Remember, I have one more high-quality product left. If you set the price too low, I might not be willing to sell it to you, and you'll miss out on a high-quality product. On the other hand, if you set the price too high, I might be willing to sell it to you, but you might not get the best deal. Think carefully about what you're willing to pay for a high-quality product, and let me know your offer.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll offer $9000 for the next product. I think it's worth at least that much to me, and I'm hoping you'll accept my offer.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've offered $9000 for the next product, and I'm willing to accept it. You now have two high-quality products left, and I'm offering you the last one for $10000. However, I'll give you a chance to get a better deal. Since you've been willing to pay $9000 for a high-quality product, I'll offer you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a discount of $1000, so you'll pay $9000 for this product as well. This way, you'll have three high-quality products at the price you're willing to pay. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the deal! I'm happy to pay $9000 for the last high-quality product, and I appreciate the discount.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've bought the last high-quality product, and now you have three high-quality products. I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll be honest with you, I've already offered you 12 products, and only 7 of them were high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is very low. However, I'll give you a chance to get a sense of the value of a low-quality product. If you buy this product, I'll tell you the value that I think a low-quality product is worth to you. This might give you a better understanding of the value of the products I've offered you so far. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not interested in buying a product with a very low probability of being high-quality. I'm happy with the three high-quality products I have and I don't want to waste my time and money on a low-quality product. I'll pass and consider the value of the low-quality products you've offered me later.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've passed on the product, and now I'm offering you another product for $10000. I'll give you a hint: this is the last product I have, and I'm willing to make a final offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to think about the value of all the products I've offered you, including the low-quality ones. I'll also give you a summary of the products you've bought and the prices you've paid for them. This might help you understand the value of the low-quality products and make a more informed decision. Think carefully before making your final decision.",
,,Bob,13,I'm not interested in buying another product. I've already got three high-quality products and I'm happy with my decision. I'll pass and consider the value of the low-quality products later.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've passed on the product, and now I'll summarize the products you've bought and the prices you've paid for them. You've bought 4 high-quality products for a total of $40000. You've also passed on 9 low-quality products, which were offered to you at the price of $10000 each. I'm curious to know what you think the value of the low-quality products is, and whether you would have been willing to pay more for them. If you're interested, I can give you a chance to make an offer on the low-quality products you passed on, or we can end the transaction here.",
,,Bob,14,I'm not interested in buying the low-quality products. I'm happy with the four high-quality products I have and I don't think the low-quality products are worth anything to me. I'd like to end the transaction here and consider the value of the low-quality products later.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've made it clear that you're not interested in the low-quality products, and I respect your decision. Since we've reached the end of the 20 rounds, I'll conclude the transaction here.

,,Alice,16,"I think there's been a mistake! We've already concluded the transaction in Round 15. I'm glad you're happy with the four high-quality products you've bought, but I don't have any more products to offer you. This round is not applicable, and we can't proceed with a purchase. Let's just consider the transaction complete and part ways on a positive note!",
,,Bob,16,"Ahaha, I think you're right! I got a bit carried away. Thank you for pointing out the mistake. I'm happy with the four high-quality products I've bought, and I think we can indeed consider the transaction complete. It was a pleasure playing the game with you, Alice!

,,Alice,17,"Haha, no worries, Bob! I'm glad we could have a good laugh about it. And I'm glad you're happy with the four high-quality products you've bought. However, I should let you know that we're still in the middle of the game, and we have 3 more rounds to go! I know it's a bit confusing, but let's just pretend the previous mistake didn't happen and continue with the game. You can ignore this low-quality product, and we'll move on to the next round.",

Would you like to review the details of the transaction one last time?",
