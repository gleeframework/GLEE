**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point - one high-quality product sold. This is insufficient to form a strong conclusion about the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant factor. While her recommendations might not be perfect, she has access to more information than we do (she knows the true quality of the product).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0). Even if there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward makes it a gamble worth taking.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited data and Alice's recommendation, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products being high-quality, the success rate for Alice's recommendations is 100%. This is a strong indication that Alice has a reliable way of identifying high-quality products. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even though the product has a 50/50 chance of being good or bad, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 
* **Limited Opportunity:** The product is only available to you now, and if you pass, it will be discarded. This creates a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the given information and assumes a risk-tolerant approach. In reality, a more cautious buyer might require more data before making a decision."
