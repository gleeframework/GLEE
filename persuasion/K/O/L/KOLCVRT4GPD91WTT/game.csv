,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since I still don't know its quality and I've already lost $1000000 on the previous low-quality product. I might as well try to get a high-quality one this time."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,I'm not going to get too excited just yet. I've been burned before when Alice recommends a product that turns out to be low-quality. I'll wait and see if this one is actually good before buying it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've learned my lesson from the previous rounds. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality, but when she does recommend one, it might be high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's the one that's actually good."

,,Alice,19,no,
