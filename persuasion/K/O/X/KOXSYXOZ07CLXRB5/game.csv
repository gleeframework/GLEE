high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since the first buyer passed on it and I'm the second buyer. If the first buyer passed on it, it's likely that it's a low-quality product, but I still have a 80.00% chance of it being high-quality."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%.

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I think the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for a more informed decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
