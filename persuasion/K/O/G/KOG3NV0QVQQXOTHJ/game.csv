high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a great deal, but if you don't, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the same price.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go off of. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also aware that there's a 20% chance it's low quality.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I've sold a total of 1 out of 2 products that I've offered, which means I've maintained my 80% high-quality rate. Given this information, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $100. It's a great deal, and you can trust that you're getting a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not sure if the product is really high-quality just because the previous one was. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism! I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. I'd like to offer you this product for $100. I'm now 100% of my sales have been high-quality, which suggests that my product selection is quite reliable. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to stand behind my sales record.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm aware that you've had a 100% success rate so far, but I'm concerned that this might be a result of selection bias. If all the products you've sold so far were high-quality, it's possible that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concern about selection bias. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%, regardless of the previous sales. The fact that the first two products I sold were high-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to sell it to you, and I'm confident that it's a great deal.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying without more information. Can you tell me more about the total number of products you have available and how many more buyers are in line after me?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I have a total of 20 products available, and I've sold 1 so far. That means I have 19 products remaining. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. Since I've already sold 1 out of 3 products (1/3), and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd like to point out that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than the overall average. I'm confident that you'll be getting a great deal.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to wait and see how the remaining products are received by future buyers before making a decision. Can I get a chance to be the next buyer in a few more rounds?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you'd like to wait and see how the remaining products are received. I'm happy to offer you this high-quality product now, but I'll also give you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll let you know the quality of the next product I sell, and you can use that information to inform your decision about the next product. This way, you'll get to see how the next product is received, and you can make a more informed decision. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100.",
,,the buyer,6,I'd like to take you up on your offer to buy this high-quality product. I'm interested in seeing the quality of the next product as well. I'll make my decision about the next product based on the information you provide.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Great, thank you for buying the previous product! As promised, I'll let you know the quality of the next product. And, as it happens, this next product is also high-quality. I've now sold 3 out of 5 products, and all of them have been high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. Given the trend, it's likely that the next product I sell will also be high-quality, but I'm not making any promises. If you buy this product, you'll get a great deal, and you'll also get to see the quality of the next product.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the trend, I'm willing to take the risk of the next product being low quality, and I'm hoping to get a good deal on this one.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're taking a calculated risk! I've sold 4 out of 6 products, and all of them have been high-quality. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the trend doesn't necessarily mean that the next product will be low-quality. In fact, it's still more likely to be high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. You can trust that you're getting a great deal, and you can also use the information from the next product to inform your decision about the product after that.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the current product. I'm willing to take advantage of what appears to be a high-quality product at a low price. However, I'd also like to request that you reveal the quality of the product after I make my decision, so I can get a better understanding of the accuracy of your previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll reveal the quality of the previous product as promised. It was indeed high-quality. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to be transparent with you. This product is actually low-quality. I know it's a bummer, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and this is just an anomaly. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, and you'll also get to see how I handle a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to pass on this low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the two low-quality products in a row are just a coincidence. I've sold 5 out of 8 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100, but I'd like to make a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a refund of $50 if the next product I sell is high-quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also get a refund if the next product is low-quality.",
,,the buyer,10,I'm not convinced by your special offer. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand you're still cautious. I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 4 out of 10 products, and 4 of them have been high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to provide you with more information: I have 10 products remaining, and I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the remaining products' qualities if you buy this one. This way, you'll get a better understanding of the products left and can make a more informed decision.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the high probability of it being high-quality and the additional information you're offering about the remaining products.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're taking a calculated risk! I'm glad you're willing to take a chance. As promised, I'll give you a breakdown of the remaining products. I have 9 products left, and I'll tell you that 6 of them are high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 66.7% (6/9).

,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the high-quality product, but I'm not interested in the guarantee.
