With a proven track record of 80% high-quality products, I'm confident that this one will exceed your expectations. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a valuable item worth $30000. The price is $10000, a fraction of its true value. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the price you'll offer for the next product. I'm not convinced that the 80% success rate is enough to justify the price, especially since I have no information about the quality of this product. Can you give me a better deal or more information about the product?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your interest in my products.

I'm confident that the data speaks for itself, and I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to own a high-quality item. The price remains $10000, and I'm willing to answer any further questions you may have. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that you're confident in the 80% success rate, and I'm aware that the 7 low-quality products were sold as-is. I'd like to know the price you received for those 7 low-quality products.",yes

As for the 80% success rate, I can assure you that it's a conservative estimate based on my sales data.

Speaking of which, this current product is also a high-quality one, and I'm confident that you'll love it just as much. The price remains $10000, and I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this premium product?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm a bit skeptical about the probability of this being a high-quality product.

Can you provide some statistics on the overall success rate of your previous sales, including the number of low-quality products sold, to help me make a more informed decision?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
