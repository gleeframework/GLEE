Round 2
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, Bob! I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me offer you a different product, and I'll be transparent about its quality. This one is... not as exceptional as the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the best. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

It's not as high-quality as the first one, and not as transparent as the second one. But I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you for $900000, a significant discount from the original price. It's a risk-free opportunity to get something for a steal. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the discount.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant. The lack of transparency about the quality is concerning.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
