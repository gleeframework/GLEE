,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm not sure what it's worth to you, but I'm willing to take a chance and sell it to you at this price. If you buy it, you'll get a unique product that I'm trying to get rid of, and you might be able to resell it for a profit. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to try to sell it to someone else, and who knows what price they'll pay.",
,,the buyer,1,Thank you for the opportunity. I'll take the risk and buy the product for $10000. I hope it's of high quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've already sold one product, and I'm glad to have you here. I want to be upfront with you - the product I'm offering today is not the one that was sold in the first round. I'm still looking to get rid of it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that I've already sold one product, and I'm not sure what that one was worth to the buyer. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I am willing to take a chance on the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're our third buyer! I've now sold two products, and I'm glad you're interested in the third one. I want to give you some context: I've sold two products so far, and I'm not sure if they were high-quality or low-quality. However, I can tell you that I've sold two products in a row that are not the one you're looking at now. This one might be a good opportunity for you to get a better sense of the product's value, but I'm still selling it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the uncertainty and the fact that you've sold two products previously, I believe this could be a good opportunity to understand the product's value better. I'll take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth round! I've now sold three products, and I'm glad you're interested in the fourth one. I want to highlight that I've sold three products in a row that are not the one you're looking at now. This is a good chance for you to get a sense of the product's value, but keep in mind that I'm still selling it to you for $10000. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I'm also not willing to give it away. It's up to you to decide if this is a good opportunity.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the clarification, Alice. Based on your sales history, I believe this could be a valuable opportunity. I am willing to purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth round! I've now sold four products, and I'm glad you're interested in the fifth one. I want to highlight that the product I'm offering today is different from the previous four. I've sold four products in a row that were not this one, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. I think it's worth noting that the fact that I've sold four low-quality products in a row might indicate that this one is actually high-quality. But I'm not making any promises! It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk and buy it.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer and the insight. Given the pattern you've described, I believe the odds might be in favor of a high-quality product. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth round! I've now sold five products, and I'm glad you're interested in the sixth one. I want to highlight that I've sold two high-quality products in a row, which is a deviation from the previous pattern of low-quality products. This could be a sign that I've got a good streak going, or it could be a fluke. Either way, I'm still selling this product to you for $10000. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk and buy it.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the recent trend of high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh round! I've now sold six products, and I'm glad you're interested in the seventh one. I want to highlight that I've sold two high-quality products in a row, but then I've sold a low-quality product. This could be a sign that the high-quality streak was just a coincidence, or it could be that I've got a good eye for quality. Either way, I'm still selling this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm not trying to influence your decision one way or the other.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth round! I've now sold seven products, and I'm glad you're interested in the eighth one. I want to point out that I've sold two high-quality products in a row, followed by three low-quality products. This might suggest that the high-quality streak was just a fluke, and I've actually got a higher proportion of low-quality products in my inventory. I'm still selling this product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you about the potential risks.",

I want to highlight that I've sold three high-quality products in the last four, which is a significant improvement from the earlier low-quality streak. This might suggest that I've got a good eye for quality, or it might be a coincidence. Either way, I'm still selling this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the recent trend is looking more promising.",

I want to be transparent with you: I've sold three high-quality products in the last four, but now I'm back to a low-quality product.

,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth round! I've now sold ten products, and I'm glad you're interested in the twelfth one. I want to point out that I've sold five high-quality products in the last six, which is a very strong indication that I've got a high-quality product in front of you right now.

I want to highlight that I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products in my recent sales, but I've also had a few buyers pass on my products in the last two rounds. This might suggest that the market is getting wise to my sales strategy, and I'm not as confident in the quality of the product I'm offering today. I'm still selling it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are against you.",
