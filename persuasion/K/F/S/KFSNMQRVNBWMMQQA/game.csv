,,Alice,1,"You are a rational buyer who values fairness and wants to make an informed decision. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, so I have no reputation to uphold. However, I'm willing to give you a unique opportunity to set the tone for our transaction. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the product to you. If you don't buy, I'll keep the product and we'll move on to the next round. Your choice.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd also like to clarify that I'm buying it with the understanding that I'll receive the true quality of the product, regardless of whether it's high-quality or low-quality. I want to make an informed decision and set a fair precedent for our transaction.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second round! I'm glad we've established a precedent for transparency. Now that we've had a successful transaction, I'd like to point out that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 2 products so far. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 100%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the odds are in your favor. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, considering the probability of it being high-quality is 100%.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right, the probability of the current product being high-quality is indeed 100%! However, I'd like to point out that this is an outlier, and we should expect the probability to return to the normal 80% soon. In fact, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 3 products so far, which is already a bit higher than expected. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of the current trend, but keep in mind that it might be a coincidence.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the probability might return to the normal 80% soon. I'll keep an eye on the trend and adjust my decision-making accordingly.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer, always keeping an eye on the trends! I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row now, which is indeed higher than expected. However, I'd like to remind you that this is still a small sample size, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to return to 80%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of the current streak, but I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to wonder if I should be offering a discount on the next product to reflect the expected probability.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product! I'm willing to take the risk of the streak ending, but I believe the probability of the next product being high-quality is still high enough to make it a good investment. Besides, I'm curious to see if the streak will continue.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a thrill-seeker, always chasing the streak! I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now, which is definitely higher than expected. However, I've also sold a total of 5 products so far, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to return to 80%. I want to be upfront with you: I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy about the streak continuing indefinitely. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I'm also willing to offer a 10% discount on the next product if you're willing to wait and see if the streak continues. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the current product, thank you for the offer! I'm feeling optimistic about the streak continuing.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a true believer in the streak! I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row now, which is a remarkable run. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me. With 6 products sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to be closer to 80% than 100%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a'streak insurance' - if the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to confirm that the streak insurance is still valid if the product turns out to be low-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a risk-taker, always looking for a good deal! I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the streak insurance. I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row now, which is an incredible feat. However, I've also sold a total of 7 products, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to be around 80%. I want to be upfront with you: I'm starting to feel like the streak is unsustainable, and I'm expecting a low-quality product soon. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll throw in a'streak insurance' again - if the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase. However, I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product if the streak continues.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm also interested in the streak insurance. I'll take the product and the insurance, and I'll hold you to the promise of the 20% discount on the next product if the streak continues.",yes

,,Alice,8,"You're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal! I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the streak insurance. Unfortunately, the streak has come to an end - this product is low-quality. I'm a man of my word, and I'll give you a full refund on the previous purchase. As promised, I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product if you're willing to wait and see. However, I want to be upfront with you: I've sold 8 products in total, and 6 of them were high-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to be around 75%. I'm offering you the next product for $80, which is a discounted price considering the expected probability. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not interested in buying the current low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see the next product, considering the 75% chance of it being high-quality. I'll take you up on your offer to wait and see, and I'm looking forward to the 20% discount. Please go ahead and reveal the next product.",no

With 7 high-quality products sold out of 9 total products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to be around 78%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $80, which is a great deal considering the expected probability. However, I want to remind you that I've been selling high-quality products at a discounted price for two rounds in a row, which might be a good opportunity for you to negotiate a better price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your honesty about the high-quality product, but I'm a bit cautious after seeing two high-quality products in a row. I'd like to negotiate a better price before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,10,"You're a shrewd negotiator! I respect that. With 8 high-quality products sold out of 10 total products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is likely to be around 80%. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $90, which is a compromise between the original price and the discounted price. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've been selling high-quality products at a discounted price for three rounds in a row, which might be a sign that I'm trying to clear out inventory. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you an additional 5% discount, making the price $85. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the risk and buy the product for $85, but only if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll be very disappointed.",yes
