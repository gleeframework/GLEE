,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and it's a 50/50 chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a better sense of the product's quality based on your previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me the statistics of the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation function."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, so she's likely recommending low-quality products to avoid selling any high-quality ones. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm doing this because the fact that you're recommending not to buy suggests that the product is likely to be low quality, which would be a good thing for me since I only value high-quality products at $300 and low-quality products at $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the probability of it being low quality, and I'm willing to take the chance of potentially getting a $300 product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think that's a good sign that it might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it, which makes me suspect it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a high price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that your previous recommendations were based on the product quality, and since you're not recommending it, it's likely to be low quality. However, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, as I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'd rather find out the result than pass on a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and given your previous recommendations, it seems like the probability of it being high quality is relatively low."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 11 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 12 buyers purchased the high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
