low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go by. I'll take the chance to get a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a potential profit of $1000000."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on Alice's recommendation, it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product has increased, but I'm not convinced yet. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to gather more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the 33.33% chance. I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the average, which would be 66.67% if the quality of the products were evenly distributed. Since 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so under the assumption that it's likely to be low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 7 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product purchased it, and none of the products sold were high quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low quality. I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I think it's possible that the low-quality products are being sold more frequently than expected. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get lucky."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
