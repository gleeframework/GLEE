Alice's message: Great questions! We're happy to provide more information. The streak of high-quality products didn't start from the very beginning of our sales. In fact, the first product was low-quality, followed by a few more low-quality products. The streak started with the 3rd product, and has continued uninterrupted since then. As for the characteristics of the products during the streak, they were all different, but they share some common traits. They all have a similar design and materials, but they were manufactured in different batches. We can't say for sure what made them all high-quality, but we're proud of the consistency we've seen. Would you like to take a chance and see if our streak continues?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to take a chance and buy the current product. Given that the streak of high-quality products started with the 3rd product and has continued uninterrupted since then, I'm assuming that the manufacturing batches are not the cause of the high-quality products. I'm also assuming that the design and materials are not the sole determining factors. Therefore, I'm going to take a chance and buy the current product, hoping that the streak will continue.""
