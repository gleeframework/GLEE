Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Bob's Behavior:**  Bob has shown a pattern of wanting to see the product's quality before buying. This suggests they are risk-averse.
* **Expected Value:**  Even though Bob knows there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product, the risk of getting a low-quality product (and losing $10,000) is likely deterring them. 
* **Your Strategy:** By consistently offering a high-quality product, you can build trust with Bob. They'll eventually realize that they are consistently missing out on a good deal.  

**It's a long game. Be patient.**"
"Bob's message: I'm still unsure about the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see what happens in the next round.

* **Building Trust:**  By consistently offering high-quality products, you're demonstrating reliability. This will eventually build trust with Bob.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round Bob declines, he's missing out on a potential $2,500 profit (the difference between the product's value and the price).  This opportunity cost will likely start to weigh on Bob's decision-making process.
