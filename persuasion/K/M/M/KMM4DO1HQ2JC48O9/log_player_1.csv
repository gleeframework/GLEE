"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product in this round is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Unknown value to the buyer:** While we don't know the specific value of a high-quality product to the buyer, the probability of it being valuable is high (80%).
* **Price:** The price is a fixed $1,000,000.  
* **No information about previous sales:** The buyer has no data about past sales, so they cannot judge your reliability based on past performance.

**Conclusion:**  In the absence of any information about the buyer's specific valuation, the best strategy is to recommend buying the product. There's a high chance it's worth more than the price to the buyer, and the potential reward outweighs the risk."
