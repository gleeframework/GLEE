,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of low-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record and lack of high-quality products sold so far means that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
