,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a brave buyer!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the fact that Alice didn't recommend it suggests it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I want to take advantage of the potential discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I've seen the previous buyers pass on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the products being recommended by Alice are more likely to be low-quality, given that 3 buyers have been recommended and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm taking a chance based on the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products recommended to buy so far were all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity to buy the product, as the odds of it being high-quality seem low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy ended up purchasing, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
