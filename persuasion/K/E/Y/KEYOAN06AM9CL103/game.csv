,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers, so I'll take a risk and pass."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold, which is 33.33%. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, so I'll take a chance on the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them ended up with a low-quality product, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers were all recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.
