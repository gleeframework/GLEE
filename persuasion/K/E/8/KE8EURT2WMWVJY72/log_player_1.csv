This warranty is only available for a limited time, and I think it's a great value add to the product. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, but considering the product was low-quality and only worth $0 to me, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate the warranty offer, but it doesn't change the fact that the product itself does not meet my needs or expectations.
