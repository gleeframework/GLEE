**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We have very little information to go on.  The previous buyer bought a high-quality product, but that's only one data point. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality. Her recommendation carries some weight, even if we don't know her motivation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**In this scenario, it's reasonable to take a gamble, especially with Alice's recommendation.**"
