high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to have another potential buyer. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1 products sold. Given the statistics, it's likely that the next product I offer is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $100. But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I can offer you a different deal...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is starting to look suspiciously like a streak. But I want to be clear with you: the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I've sold a total of 4 products so far. Given the recent streak, I'm offering you a 'discount' on this product - I'll sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again.

In fact, I'm going to be completely honest with you: I'm worried that I might have been selling too many high-quality products in a row. This product is definitely not high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Yes, that's right - the same price as before. I'm not trying to make a profit off of this one, I just want to get it off my hands. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice.
