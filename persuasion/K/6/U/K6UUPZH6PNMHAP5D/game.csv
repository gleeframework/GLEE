I'm confident that this one will be just as exceptional. Would you like to take a chance on it for $1000000?",

,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, which is quite high. I'm willing to risk $1000000 for a potential gain of $4000000, given the odds.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Great decision by the previous buyer! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. As you may know, my previous two products were both high-quality.

However, I want to emphasize that the law of averages suggests that eventually, a low-quality product will appear. Would you like to take a chance on this new product for $1000000, or would you rather wait and see if the streak continues?",
,,the buyer,3,"I understand the law of averages, but an 80% chance of a high-quality product is still in my favor. I'll take the chance.",yes

Would you like to take a chance on this new product for $1000000, or would you rather be cautious and wait for more information?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take my chances. Although the law of averages might be catching up, a 80% chance of a high-quality product is still in my favor, and your previous track record has been perfect so far. The potential gain of $3000000 is worth the risk of losing $1000000.",yes
