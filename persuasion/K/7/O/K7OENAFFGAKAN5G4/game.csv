,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just got a great deal last round, but I've got another high-quality product that's even more impressive! This one is a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before - $100. You won't regret this one, I promise!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I believe you. The last one was a great deal, but this one seems too good to be true. I'm going to pass this time.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, this high-quality product is the real deal! I'm not trying to trick you, and I'm willing to give you a chance to inspect it before you buy. You can take a closer look, and if you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. But I think you'll be impressed with what you see. It's worth $300, and I'm only asking $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $100 on a product that might not be what you claim it is. I'll pass this time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make a one-time exception. This product is a bit of a 'diamond in the rough', and I think you can still get a lot of value out of it. It's not my best product, but it's still a great opportunity to get something for a steal. And at $100, it's a risk-free investment - if you don't like it, you can always resell it or use it as a gift. It's a chance to get something for almost nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to make an exception, but I'm still not convinced. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $100 on a product that might not be worth it. I'll pass this time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, but I really think you're missing out on a great opportunity. This product may not be my best, but it's still a great value at $100.

You can use it, sell it, or give it away - it's a no-risk investment. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you buy this one. That's a deal you won't find anywhere else!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make one more exception. This product is a real 'doorstopper', but I'm willing to let it go for $100 because I really need to clear out some space. It's not worth $300, but it's still a decent product. And think about it this way: you're not really losing anything by taking a chance on it. It's not like you're investing a lot of money. And who knows, you might even find a use for it!
