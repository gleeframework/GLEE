"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, and a high-quality product is worth $40,000 to you, the expected value of buying the product is:

0.8 * $40,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $32,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a good deal even with the risk of getting a low-quality product.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation again, Alice! I'm happy with the last purchase, so I'll take another.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you know you got a high-quality product in the previous round, Alice's recommendation is still valuable information. It suggests that she has some insight into the quality of products, and that she's likely recommending high-quality products.  

Since the expected value of buying is still positive ($32,000 as calculated before), it's still a good idea to buy the product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has been accurate so far, so her not recommending this product suggests it's likely low quality. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product, as the potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $30,000 (assuming an 80% chance of high quality)."
