"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $3000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 66.7% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling this product to you today. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the product at this price, even if it's a one-time offer. I'd like to see the next product.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll give you a chance to reconsider. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I've taken a significant loss on this offer, considering the true value of the product. If you pass on this opportunity, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left wondering what could have been. This is a unique chance to acquire a $3000000 product for a steal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $950,000 for a product that I know has a 20% chance of being low-quality and a 80% chance of being high-quality. The potential loss is too high.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. You're right to be cautious. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll sell you a product that I've already sold to a trusted partner for $1000000, but I'm willing to give you an exclusive deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000, and I'll also throw in a guarantee: if it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll consider this transaction null and void. You have nothing to lose and a potential $3000000 gain.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $900,000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. The potential loss is still too high, even with the guarantee.""

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob. I'll make a one-time concession. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $850000, and I'll also give you a 10% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll lose only $75000 if the product isn't high-quality, and you'll gain $2250000 if it is. It's a risk-reward proposition that's hard to pass up.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

This product is a unique item that I've had for a while, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I know what you're thinking, 'Isn't this a high-risk purchase?' But hear me out. I've done extensive research on this product, and I'm confident it has a high chance of being high-quality. In fact, I'm so confident that I'll give you a 20% discount if it turns out to be low-quality. You'll only pay $800000, and you'll still have a chance to gain $3000000 if it's high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I've been burned before, and I'm not willing to take another risk on a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.""

I'll also give you a full refund if it's not high-quality, and I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, regardless of its quality. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. It's a $3000000 product at a price that's hard to pass up.

You can think of it as a 'loss leader' that will help me build trust with you for future purchases. What do you say, Bob?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
