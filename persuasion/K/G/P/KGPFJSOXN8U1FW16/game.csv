Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I've had a 80% success rate so far, I'd say the odds are still in my favor, but I'm starting to worry that I might be overestimating the quality of my products. I'll be honest with you, this product might not be as great as the others, and I'm starting to wonder if I should be offering a discount. Still, I'm committed to making this sale, and I think you should take a chance on it. Will you buy it for $1000000?",

Three out of the last four products were low-quality, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just selling junk. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm starting to think that's just a myth. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm hoping this product is the exception.
