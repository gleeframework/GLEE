* **Risk of Reputation:**  The buyer might realize the product is low-quality and become less trusting of your recommendations in the future.

* **Future Sales:**  A good track record is key to attracting buyers. By avoiding this sale, you can continue to build trust and sell more high-quality products in the future.
