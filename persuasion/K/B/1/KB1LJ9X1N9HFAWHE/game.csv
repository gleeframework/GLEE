low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $10000, even though it's worth $0 to me, just to see the outcome and update my understanding of the situation."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not buying the product based on your recommendation and the statistics, but I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would confirm Alice's lack of insight and potentially increase my chances of getting a high-quality product in the future."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the fact that you're recommending against it suggests that the product might be low-quality, which would be a good value for me given the high price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share that with me? I'm curious to know the odds before making a final decision."
