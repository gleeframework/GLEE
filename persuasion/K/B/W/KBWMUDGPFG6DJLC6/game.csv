low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests the product may be low-quality, and I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product by being the second buyer."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm going to pass on this product. The fact that you don't recommend it and the low sales rate of high-quality products suggests that this product is likely low-quality."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the products you've recommended so far have been low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have any information to go on, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product. I'm aware that the odds are against me, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and based on the previous sales record, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and the thought process behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to infer that the current product is also likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the products they saw were low-quality.
