low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 buyer purchased a product, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 buyer has purchased so far and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer purchases and receives a high-quality product, which would update the probability of the current product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the products offered so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the products recommended to them, which suggests a low quality product. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that all the previous two products were low-quality, which would suggest that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk based on the low probability of that happening."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that this product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from a new buyer who has not yet seen the previous sales record, to see if they might be more optimistic about the product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them purchased a high-quality one. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be presented."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, all 5 previous buyers chose not to buy the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product as well."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality.
