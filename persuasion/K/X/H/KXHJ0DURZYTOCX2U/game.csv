,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution, Bob. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not surprised you're hesitant. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty in our transactions. I'll give you a hint: I have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product in the next round.
