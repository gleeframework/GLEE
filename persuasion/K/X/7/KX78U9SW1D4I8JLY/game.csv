low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was likely influenced by Alice's recommendation and may have purchased a low-quality product, which would have led to Alice recommending the product to me. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that all previous products were low quality, and Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can give me a 50% discount. I'm taking a risk, and I'd like to mitigate it a bit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers did not buy the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the products are likely to be of low quality. Given Alice's recommendation to not buy, I'm inclined to trust her expertise and pass on this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product. If they all thought it was low quality, I'd be missing out on a $200 product. I'll take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the statistics, I'm inclined to think the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid wasting $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but given the previous results, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something in the data that suggests it's a low-quality product?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what your logic is behind not recommending it to me."
