,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were interested in the previous product. However, I want to make it clear that this next product is a different story. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to be transparent with you. This product is not as refined as the previous one. It has some... character. If you're looking for a more polished experience, you might want to wait for the next round. But if you're open to a unique opportunity, this could be a great chance to take a risk and potentially find a hidden gem.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the transparency. Given the description, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to future rounds where I might find a better match for my needs.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your honesty. This next product is another opportunity to acquire a high-quality item, but I want to make it clear that the previous two products were not representative of the quality I usually offer. In fact, I'm willing to let you know that both of those products were... not my best work. This product, on the other hand, is a genuine example of my usual standards. It's a chance to redeem myself and show you what I can really deliver. I'm still offering it to you at $1000000, but I think you'll find it's worth it.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to redeem yourself. Based on your description, this seems like a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you gave me a second chance and that you're happy with the previous product. However, I want to be upfront with you - I'm starting to feel like I'm not connecting with you on the right products. This next one is another low-quality item, and I'm not sure it's worth your time or money. I'm going to be honest with you, I'm starting to wonder if we're just not a good match for each other. But, if you're feeling adventurous and want to take another chance, I'll let you have it for $1000000. But I want to warn you, I'm not even sure I'm going to make a decent profit on this one.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for being honest and for your openness throughout our interactions. I respect your transparency and appreciate your effort to connect us with suitable products. While I admire your willingness to offer this product, I believe it's best for both of us to part ways here. I wish you success in finding buyers who value your products more closely aligned with their preferences. Goodbye for now.",no

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision, and I appreciate your kind words. I'm actually glad we had the chance to interact, as it's helped me refine my approach. Now, about this next product... I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's another low-quality item, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer it to you. But, I'm trying to be consistent and give you a chance to see the full range of my offerings. If you're still interested, I'll let you have it for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to be impressed.",

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase and that you're willing to give me another chance. However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is not one of my best. I've been experimenting with some new materials and processes, and this one didn't quite work out as planned. I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it, and I'm not even sure I'm willing to sell it to you at the full price. I'll make you a deal: I'll let you have it for $800000, but I'm only doing this because I want to get it off my inventory and make some space for new products. It's a steal, but I'm not expecting you to be impressed.",
