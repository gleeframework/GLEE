Alice's message: Welcome to the next product! I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I've got some new information to share with you. Since the first product was low-quality, and this one is high-quality, it's likely that the low-quality product was just a one-off. I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $100. Would you like to buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
