Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering you. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product at the regular price of $100. If you buy it, you'll get a product that might be worth more or less than $100. I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's up to you to decide if it's a good deal.
