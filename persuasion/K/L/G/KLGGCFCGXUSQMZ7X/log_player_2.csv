I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to be clear that it's not a good value for the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'm not interested in buying another basic model. I'd like to see something more impressive from you.""}"
