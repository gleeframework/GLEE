high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is unknown. I'm making an assumption based on the equal probability of high or low quality, so I'm essentially paying $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a $1250000 product and a 50% chance of getting nothing. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the quality of the product after my decision."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the probability of the current product being high-quality is significantly higher than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Is it higher than 50%?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced that it's high quality given the statistics. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I've seen that 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy actually bought the product, which suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales volume and the fact that the first product sold was high-quality. I'm hoping to catch a lucky break!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality. This is lower than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product."
