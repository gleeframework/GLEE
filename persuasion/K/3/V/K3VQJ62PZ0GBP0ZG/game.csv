,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get it for $1000000. If it's high-quality, I'll lose $1000000, but I'm willing to take that risk given the information I have."
