"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High potential payoff:**  The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is worth $12,500 to you.
* **No information loss:**  Even if it turns out to be low quality, you lose nothing but the $10,000 purchase price. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee anything, it's still valuable information.  It suggests she might have some insight into the quality of this particular product, even if she doesn't know its value to you.

This strategy is a good balance of risk and reward in this situation."

* **Similar situation to round 1:** The odds and potential payoff are the same.
* **Positive experience:** The previous round resulted in a positive outcome, reinforcing the potential for a good return on investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation change:** Alice's recommendation has shifted from ""buy"" to ""don't buy"". This suggests she might have a better understanding of the product's quality than random chance. 
* **Risk aversion:**  While the product could still be high quality, the odds are now against it. Passing allows you to avoid the potential $10,000 loss if it turns out to be low quality.
