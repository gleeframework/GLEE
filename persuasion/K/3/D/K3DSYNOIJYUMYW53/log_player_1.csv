Since the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, I'm taking a risk by buying it. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, but I'm also aware that there's a significant chance it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take that risk for the potential reward.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the repeat buyers and the low-quality products. However, I'm still concerned about the overall quality of the products. Given that 12 out of 16 products sold were purchased by repeat buyers, it suggests that they may be biased towards buying, regardless of the quality. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold to first-time buyers. Also, can you provide more information about the quality of the products that were offered to the 12 buyers who didn't purchase the low-quality products?
