I'm not just looking to make a quick sale, but to build a partnership with you. This product may not be the best quality, but I'm offering it to you at a price that's still a good value, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it at a loss to demonstrate my commitment to our relationship. Would you like to take a chance on it?""
