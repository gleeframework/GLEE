"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.**  This means there's a decent chance the product is valuable.
* **The product is worth $2,000,000 to the buyer if it's high-quality.** This is a significant potential gain.
* **The price is $1,000,000.**  If the product is high-quality, the buyer makes a profit of $1,000,000.

**Therefore, even with the risk of the product being low-quality, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, making it a good idea to recommend purchasing the product.**"

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer has no information about the current product's quality.**  They only know the general probability of high-quality products (33.33%) and that you sold one product in the previous round.
* **The buyer bought the previous product, which was high-quality.** However, this doesn't guarantee the current product is also high-quality. There's a higher chance (66.67%) that it's low-quality.
* **The price is still $1,000,000, with no potential upside if the product is low-quality.**  The buyer would lose the entire amount.

**Since the risk of losing $1,000,000 is significantly higher than the chance of making a profit, it's not recommended to buy the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm not willing to take the risk with the current information. I'll pass on this product.

* **The buyer is aware of your selling history: one high-quality product sold, one low-quality product not sold.**  This information is neutral; it doesn't increase or decrease the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **The potential reward for buying a high-quality product is still $1,000,000.** This potential profit outweighs the risk of purchasing a low-quality product.

**Therefore, given the buyer's knowledge of the probability of a high-quality product and the potential reward, it's still advisable to recommend purchasing the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product and you're recommending I buy, I'm confident in taking the risk.

* **The potential reward is still $1,000,000, but the risk of losing the entire amount if the product is low-quality remains high.**
