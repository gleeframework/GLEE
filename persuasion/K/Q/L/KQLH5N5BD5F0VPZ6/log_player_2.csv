**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold have been high quality, which is a 100% success rate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the potential value of the product.  

While there's still a risk (we know the overall probability of low quality is higher), the data strongly suggests this is a high-quality product, making it a worthwhile gamble."
