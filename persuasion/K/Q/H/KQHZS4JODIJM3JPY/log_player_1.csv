Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No Information to the Contrary:** The buyer has no reason to believe this specific product is *not* high-quality. There's no history to judge from, and no specific details about the product have been shared.

**Strategic Considerations:**

While it's tempting to be cautious in the first round, it's in your best interest as Alice to encourage sales.  Building a positive sales history will increase your chances of selling more products in the future."
