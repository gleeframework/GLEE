"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, and she's recommending you buy it, there's a strong chance it's a high-quality product.  Given the payoff structure (high-quality = $400, low-quality = $0), it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product."
