,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not buying. Given that you didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume the product is likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if the product is high quality, I'll be the only buyer who has purchased a high-quality product, which might indicate that the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to overpay."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $10000 product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's reasonable to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is still 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think it's unlikely to be high quality given the previous 3 buyers didn't find it worth buying, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my perception of the product's quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the odds are against me. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make a decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold, though."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there something in the data that suggests the product is low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's recommendation is no, and I'm trying to find a pattern in her behavior. I'm hoping to catch her in a mistake and get a high-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the probability is 50% and I could potentially get a high-quality product worth $20000."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
