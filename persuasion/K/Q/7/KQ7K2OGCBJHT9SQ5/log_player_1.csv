Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the expected value of the purchase is:

* 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $200 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $100 

The buyer is paying $100, which is exactly the expected value. Therefore, it is a reasonable recommendation to buy."

* 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $200 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $100 

As the price is $100, it's still a reasonable recommendation to buy."
