{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your offer is tempting, I still need more information.  Providing the contact information of an independent expert is a step in the right direction, but I'd like to see more evidence of the product's quality, not just the word of one expert. I'd like to know more about this third-party expert and their credentials, and perhaps even their findings and data on the product's effectiveness. I also need to understand the risks involved in using this technology.  A 60-day money-back guarantee is great, but it doesn't address the potential for any unforeseen consequences or side effects.
