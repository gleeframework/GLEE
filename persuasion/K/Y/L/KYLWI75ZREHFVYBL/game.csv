,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality before any sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go on. I'm willing to buy the product and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I can still get a good deal even if it's low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Can you share the probability of this product being high quality based on the sales record so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not confident in purchasing without a positive recommendation from you, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the product after I make my decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to know more about the previous products before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 other buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered will be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm taking a risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you trying to discourage me from buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended to be bought were low-quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendation. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%. However, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she knows the true quality of the product. If she recommends a product, it's likely that the product is of low quality, as she has no incentive to recommend a high-quality product that would increase the price of the product to $1250000. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian and think the product might be high quality. Plus, I'm the 5th buyer, and I don't want to see it get discarded."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With no high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take my chances."
