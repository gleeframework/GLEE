I've had some time to reflect on our previous transaction, and I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you at the same price of $1000000.

I'm not trying to deceive you or take advantage of you, but I do want to be transparent about the product's quality. Please consider whether the price of $1000000 is worth the potential benefits you might derive from owning this product, despite its lower quality.",
