high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on Alice's random selection, and I'll learn from the outcome to make better decisions in the future."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather her own interests."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the previous buyer's purchase has significantly changed the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and that I have an independent probability of the product being high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk given Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 buyers have purchased the product and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk, given the low quality of the previous sales record."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 6 sold, the probability seems to be around 16.67%. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33% in general, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take that risk."
