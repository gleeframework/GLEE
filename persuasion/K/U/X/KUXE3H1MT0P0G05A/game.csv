,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be very reliable given that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might indicate a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the seller's recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I suspect that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased yet and I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 6 buyers have passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a worthless item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data and your recommendation. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm skeptical about the product given your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
