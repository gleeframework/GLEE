**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one product was sold, and it was high-quality.  This is not enough information to make a statistically significant judgment about the probability of the current product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product, so her recommendation is valuable. Even though she might be incentivized to sell, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential reward for a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss for a low-quality product ($0). 

**In this scenario, it's a calculated risk. While there's a 50/50 chance, Alice's recommendation makes the ""buy"" decision more attractive.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Record:** Alice's recommendations have resulted in 100% high-quality products being sold. This suggests that she is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with a 50% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**This decision assumes that Alice is acting in good faith and wants to help buyers get the best deal possible.** However, there is no guarantee that this will always be the case."
