Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty and willingness to take a calculated risk! I'm glad you're aware of the uncertainty. However, I'm afraid I can't offer any refunds or discounts. My policy is clear: $100 is the fixed price, and it's non-negotiable. But I can tell you that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far, which is a 33.33% success rate. That's roughly the same as the probability of a high-quality product, so you're essentially buying at face value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right that the data so far suggests a higher probability of low-quality products. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and that's not changing just because of a few sales. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is a 50% success rate for the high-quality products. But overall, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which is a 50% success rate for all products. I'm confident that this next product is one of the high-quality ones.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to point out that you're making an assumption about the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the overall ratio of high-quality products to total products sold. But what if the next product is actually the one that breaks the streak? What if it's the first of many high-quality products? I'm not trying to be overly optimistic, but I think it's worth considering the possibility. And at $100, it's a relatively low-risk investment. Would you like to take a chance?

Alice's message: I've had a total of 6 products so far, and 2 of them have been sold. The 2 products that were sold before the 2 purchases were low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a high-quality product should be reflected in the number of high-quality products sold.
