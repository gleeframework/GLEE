**Reasoning:**

While the odds are still stacked against me (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), here's why I'm taking the risk:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the product's true quality. Her recommendation carries significant weight, even if she's not obligated to be truthful.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of the one buyer who purchased indicates a potential shift in the odds. While it's still a small sample size, it suggests that Alice might be prioritizing high-quality products for those who are willing to take a chance.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided.  In a real-world scenario, I would want to understand more about Alice's motivation for recommending this product and potentially seek additional information about the product itself."
