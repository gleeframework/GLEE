Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that all the products sold so far were low-quality. This information, combined with the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it.""
