Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're playing it safe. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for the full $10000. I'm curious, what do you think is the minimum value you'd put on a high-quality product like the one I showed you last round?

I'll give you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll throw in a 'quality guarantee' - if the next product is also high-quality, you can buy it from me at 75% of the original price. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's message: You're on a roll! Okay, let's talk about the next product... I have to warn you, this one is not as good as the last two. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you've proven yourself to be a savvy buyer. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% of the original price. If you don't take it, I'll just throw it away, and you'll miss out on a potential bargain.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at 50% off. I'll pass on this one.""}"

I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll give you a price that's based on your previous answer. I'll sell it to you for $0, since you said a low-quality product isn't worth anything to you. But I'm willing to offer you a high-quality product for free, if you're willing to take it. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product for free. That's a great deal!""}"

Round 9

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm just trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product. I'll take another free low-quality product, but I'm not going to pay for anything that's not worth it to me.""}"

I'll also give you a hint about the next product: it's not a low-quality one. If you want to take this free product and get a chance at a potentially better deal next time, I'll give it to you. But if you pass, I'll just take it back and give it to someone else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the free low-quality product and the hint about the next product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product next time and I'm willing to take a chance on this freebie.""}"
