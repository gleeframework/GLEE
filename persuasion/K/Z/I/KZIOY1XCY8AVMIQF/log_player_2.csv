**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in my favor:**  Since there's a 50% chance of a product being high quality, and Alice has already sold one high-quality product, it's likely that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product. Her recommendation to buy strongly suggests the product is high quality.
* **Potential upside outweighs risk:**  Even if the product is low quality, I lose only $10,000. However, if it's high quality, I gain $20,000. The potential reward outweighs the risk."
