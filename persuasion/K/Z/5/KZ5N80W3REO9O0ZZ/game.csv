,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product that is worth $4000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a 75% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this again. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that is worth $4000000 to me for $1000000, even if it's a 75% discount. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a new perspective. Imagine you could buy a high-quality product worth $4000000 to you, and then sell it to someone else for $1500000. You'd still make a profit of $1500000. This is a unique opportunity to make a significant gain. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying a product that I can't resell for a profit. I'd like to see the next product.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. Let me ask you this: are you willing to take a chance on a high-quality product that has the potential to increase in value over time? This product has a high probability of appreciating in value, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. You can hold onto it for the long-term and potentially reap the benefits of its increasing value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in taking a chance on a product that may or may not appreciate in value. I'd like to see the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the potential for appreciation in value. Let me offer you a different perspective. This product is a unique opportunity to get something for nothing. It's a product that's worth $0 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. You can essentially get a 'free' product, and you can do whatever you want with it. It's a chance to get something without spending a dime. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. That's not a good deal for me.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your point, and I respect your decision. However, let me ask you this: what if I told you that this high-quality product is not only worth $4000000 to you, but it also comes with a guarantee that it will continue to appreciate in value over time? In other words, you can be confident that its value will only increase, and you can sell it for a significant profit in the future. Would you be willing to consider this opportunity at the price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product with a guarantee of future appreciation, especially since I don't know if the guarantee is legitimate. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the guarantee. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a chance to try before you buy. You can take this high-quality product for a test drive, and if you're not satisfied with it, you can return it and get a full refund. I'm willing to take on all the risk, and I'm confident that you'll love the product. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and try the product for yourself?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in trying the product and then potentially returning it. I'd rather just buy it outright or pass on it. I'd like to see the next product.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the return policy. Let me make it simple for you. I'll give you a one-time offer to buy this high-quality product for $1000000. This is the last time I'll offer it to you at this price. If you pass on it, I'll move on to the next product and you'll never have another chance to get it at this price. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this final offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a product at $1000000, even if it's a one-time offer. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount. Think about all the potential benefits you could gain from owning this product. It's a chance to increase your wealth, improve your life, or achieve your goals. What do you think? Is the potential value worth the investment?",
,,Bob,8,"I understand the potential benefits, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. It's a significant upfront cost that I'm not willing to take on. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns about the upfront cost. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that I'm willing to finance the purchase of this high-quality product for you? You can pay me back over time, and you'll still get to enjoy the benefits of owning this product. Would you be interested in exploring this option and making this high-quality product more accessible to you?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in financing a purchase that I'm not even sure I want to make. I'd rather pay cash upfront for a product I'm sure I want, or I'll pass on it. I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your preference for paying cash upfront. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective on this low-quality product. It's not worth anything to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Think of it as a chance to get something for nothing.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns about the low-quality product. Let me go back to the high-quality product from earlier. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and sell it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered for this product, and I'm willing to make a sacrifice to get it to you. It's a chance to get a product worth $4000000 to you for a significant discount. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in buying a product that I could have bought earlier for $1000000. The fact that you're offering it to me for $900000 now doesn't change the fact that I don't want to pay $900000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'd like to see the next product.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I want to ask you to consider the opportunity cost of passing on this high-quality product. If you don't buy it now, you'll never have the chance to get it at this price again. You'll be leaving money on the table and potentially missing out on a valuable opportunity. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'll ever offer, and I'm willing to take a loss to get it to you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a product at any price, even if it's the lowest price you'll ever offer. I've had multiple opportunities to buy it at $1000000, and I've passed on it each time. I'd like to see the next product.",no

However, I want to acknowledge that you've had multiple opportunities to buy this high-quality product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I'm willing to give you one more chance to reconsider. This high-quality product is still worth $4000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $1000000. This is the same price you've had multiple times before, and I'm willing to match it one more time. What do you think?",

This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make a sacrifice to get this product to you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"The bonus gift doesn't change the fact that I'm still paying $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'm not interested in paying that much for a product, even with a bonus. I'd like to see the next product.",no
