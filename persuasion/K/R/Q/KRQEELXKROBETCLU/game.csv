low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and the previous two buyers passed on the product. I'll take a chance and buy it."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far? I'd like to understand your reasoning.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were recommended by you and none were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and considering the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm inclined to think the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers who received a recommendation to buy from you have bought the product, which suggests that the products you recommend are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers all passed on the product after your recommendation, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. Given the low price of $1000000, I'm willing to take the risk of buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 out of 5 products sold were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
