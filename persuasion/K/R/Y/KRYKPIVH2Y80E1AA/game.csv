,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best use of your money. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the chance and buy it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already bought one product, and I'm glad you're taking a chance on my offerings! However, I want to warn you that this next product is not the best quality either. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100. Are you sure you're getting a good deal?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not feeling lucky today, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,Bob,3,"I'll take the risk again, maybe my luck will change.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a glutton for punishment, aren't you? Two low-quality products in a row. I'll be honest with you, Bob, I'm starting to think you're not getting the best value out of these deals. Would you like to reconsider your strategy and pass on this one?",

,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're trying to test my sales skills! Three low-quality products in a row, and you're still willing to take the risk. Let me ask you this: are you looking for a 'participation trophy' or are you genuinely interested in buying a high-quality product for $100?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm still hoping my luck will change, and I'm willing to keep taking the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Four low-quality products in a row, Bob! I'm starting to think you're either a glutton for punishment or a secret thrill-seeker. Seriously though, I want to make you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special 'insurance' - if the next product I show you is high-quality, I'll give you a refund for this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the insurance and buy this product, hoping the next one will be high-quality.",yes

Remember, I promised you a refund if the next product is high-quality, but this one is already a great deal. I'll let you in on a secret: this product is worth a lot more than $100. Would you like to take advantage of the deal and buy it?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the deal and buy the high-quality product!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You got a great deal on the last one, didn't you? Now, I've got another product for you. Remember, you still have the insurance deal from the last one - if the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a refund for this one.

,,Alice,9,"You're really putting my insurance policy to the test, aren't you? Two low-quality products in a row, and you're still holding on to the hope that the next one will be high-quality. I'll let you in on a hint: the insurance deal is about to expire. If you buy this one and the next one is low-quality, you'll be out of luck. But if you pass on this one, I'll give you a new insurance deal. What's it going to be?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll pass on this one and take the new insurance deal, hoping to get a high-quality product next time.",no

But here's the thing: I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you buy this one, I'll give you an additional 'bonus' - I'll reveal the probability of the next product being high-quality.
