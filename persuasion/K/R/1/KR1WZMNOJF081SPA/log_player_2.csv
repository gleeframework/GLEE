Alice's message: You're considering buying from me again, I appreciate your trust! Since the first product was low-quality, you might be wondering if the next one is any better. I'll give you the facts: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. That's 1 out of 1, or 100% of my products so far. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% based on the prior distribution. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell this one to you for $10000.

The product's features and specs are: [insert generic, unimpressive features]. As you can see, it's not a high-end product.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in asking questions. I want to be transparent about the issue with the previous product. The defect was a manufacturing error that occurred during the assembly process, and it was missed by our inspectors because it was a subtle issue that required a specific type of testing that we hadn't implemented yet. We've since added that testing to our quality control process to prevent similar issues in the future. As for this product, I can assure you that it has undergone all the necessary testing and has been thoroughly inspected by our certified inspectors. I'm confident that it meets the highest standards.
