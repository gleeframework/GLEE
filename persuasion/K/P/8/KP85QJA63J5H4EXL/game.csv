high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
