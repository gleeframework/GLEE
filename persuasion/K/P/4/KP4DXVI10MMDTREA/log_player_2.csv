**Reasoning:**

* **High initial probability:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the product has an 80% chance of being high quality. This is a good starting point.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further increases the probability of the product being high quality. While we don't know her exact criteria for recommending products, it suggests she believes it's likely good.
* **Previous sales data:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase reinforces the positive signal from Alice's recommendation. 

**Overall:** The combination of the high initial probability, Alice's recommendation, and the previous sales data makes buying the product the more logical choice, despite the risk of it being low quality."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is in our favor:**  The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (7 out of 8). This suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which strengthens our confidence in its quality.
* **The expected value is positive:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product."
