A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer just bought a low-quality product in the previous round, they now know that at least one of the products I've sold is low-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the fact that they bought a low-quality product doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality. However, I can use the fact that they are willing to buy a product after seeing the low-quality one to my advantage.
