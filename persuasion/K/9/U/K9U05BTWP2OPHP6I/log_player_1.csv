Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are selling a high-quality product, which is worth $3,000,000 to the buyer. The price is $1,000,000. This is a significant profit for the buyer, so it's highly recommended to purchase it. Even though the buyer doesn't know the product's quality, they are aware that there's an 80% chance it's high-quality, which makes it a good investment."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no prior sales data, I'm willing to take a chance on the product based on your recommendation.  Let's see if it's high quality!
