``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have one data point (one sale with a high-quality product). This isn't enough to make a statistically significant judgment. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product. Her recommendation to buy is a strong signal that it's likely high-quality. Even if there's a 50/50 chance objectively, her insider knowledge makes the odds more favorable. 
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing on the product means we miss out on a potential $20,000 profit (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the selling price).

**While it's risky, given Alice's recommendation and the potential reward, buying seems like the best decision in this scenario.**"
