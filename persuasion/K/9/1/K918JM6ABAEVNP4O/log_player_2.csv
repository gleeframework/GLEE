{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Since there's no prior data, I'll trust your recommendation and buy the product. Let's hope it's high quality!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No prior data:**  There's no information about the quality of past products, so the recommendation is the only information we have.
* **Trusting the recommendation:**  Alice knows the product's quality, so her recommendation carries some weight.  Even though it's a gamble, there's no reason to distrust her at this point. 
* **Potential reward:**  The potential gain of $20,000 (if the product is high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 (if the product is low quality)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. Since you don't recommend the product, and the previous buyer's purchase suggests a potentially low quality product, I will pass on this opportunity.""}

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't know if the previous buyer was recommended a high-quality product or not. We only know that one high-quality product has been sold overall, and we're the 2nd buyer. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant piece of information. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation adds weight to the probability of this product being high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($10,000).

**While this is a risky decision, given the limited information, Alice's recommendation makes it worthwhile to take the chance.**"
