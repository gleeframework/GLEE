,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and neither of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality. I'm going to pass on this product as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products Alice is offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice can sell any high-quality products to the next buyers."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I will pass on the product to see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the low-quality products sold to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like there's a high chance that the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000. I'd like to know more about the seller's sales record and the probability of the product being high or low quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality.
