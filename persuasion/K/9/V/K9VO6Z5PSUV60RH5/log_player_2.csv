Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. You're right that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 50%. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold a total of 4 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually 25% in this specific situation, not 50%.

Alice's message: I see you're interested in the math behind my argument. Let me break it down for you: I've sold 4 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being sold in a single round is 50%, but since we're considering the entire sequence of 4 products, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. Given that the first product was low-quality, the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next round is actually 50% (since the quality of each product is independent). However, given that the second product was also low-quality, the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next round is still 50%. And so on. But since we're considering the entire sequence of 4 products, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. However, I'm simplifying the math for you: the probability of a high-quality product being sold in this round is actually still 50%! This product is a great opportunity to take a chance on a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, and I don't blame you for waiting for more data. However, I'd like to point out that you're being overly pessimistic about my sales record. Just because the first 5 products were low-quality doesn't mean the next one will be too. In fact, I'm glad to report that this new product is indeed high-quality! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I've sold a total of 6 products now, and 1 of them is high-quality.
