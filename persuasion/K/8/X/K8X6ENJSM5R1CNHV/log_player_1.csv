"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's an 80% chance any product is high-quality. Since the price is fixed and there's no way to know the exact value to Bob, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product. He has a high probability of getting a good deal, and even if it's low-quality, he's only losing a fixed amount."
