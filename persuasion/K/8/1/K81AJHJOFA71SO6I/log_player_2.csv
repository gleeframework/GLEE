I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before, $1000000. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a special deal: I'll throw in a free inspection report that reveals its flaws.

I'll be upfront - this one is worth less than $100000. I'll sell it to you for $800000, which is still a good deal considering its quality.
