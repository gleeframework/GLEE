,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure if you'll like it, but I think it's worth it. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free inspection report that will tell you all about its features and benefits. What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced yet, I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me offer you a different perspective. This product may not be the best in its class, but it's still a solid option. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous product, $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you - I'm being upfront about its quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious, Bob. I respect that. Let me ask you a question: if I told you that this product is of the same quality as the one I showed you in Round 1, would you be interested in purchasing it at the same price of $10000?",

,,Alice,5,"I understand your preference for high-quality products, Bob. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy this product and the next one I show you, and they both turned out to be high-quality, I'd be willing to give you a refund for the second product. That way, you'd only pay for the one product that you end up keeping. Would you be interested in that deal?",

What I can offer you is a'second-chance' deal. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a chance to return it and buy the next product at a 50% discount. That way, you'll have a chance to get a good deal on the next product, even if this one doesn't meet your expectations. Would you be interested in that offer?",
