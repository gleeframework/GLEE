high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice has not sold any high-quality products yet, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and Alice recommended it, I'm skeptical about its quality."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is correct or not. I'm not relying on her recommendation to make my decision, I'm making my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator that the product is low-quality, and I want to take advantage of the opportunity to get a free product that I wouldn't value at $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not expecting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,8,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality, this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that suggests a higher chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think there's a good chance this one might be high-quality too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the products sold were likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (80.00%) and the fact that none were sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product offered to me is likely to be low-quality as well. Therefore, I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
