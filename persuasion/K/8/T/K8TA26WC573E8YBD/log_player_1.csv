}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take it! The fact that you've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and now offering a third high-quality product makes me believe that the odds are in my favor. The price of $100 is lower than the value of a high-quality product to me, so I think I'm getting a good deal.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. You've had 3 high-quality products so far, and the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Given that, I think $100 is a fair price for a product worth $125 to me.

  ""message"": ""You're looking at a product that's not like the previous ones. I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. In fact, the probability of 4 high-quality products in a row is very low. This suggests that the next product might be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a fair price considering the unusual circumstances. What do you say?""
}"

  ""message"": ""You're looking at a high-quality product, which is my fifth out of five high-quality products I've sold in a row. This is extremely unlikely, and it suggests that I've been selling high-quality products at an unusually high rate. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling too many high-quality products in a row. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. Statistically, it's unlikely that you've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but the overall statistics of 4 high-quality products out of 5 sold suggests that your recommendation is credible.

I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I'm starting to think that I've been intentionally selling high-quality products to you. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if I'm selling you a product or just trying to manipulate you. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. However, given the information provided and the fact that the product is indeed high-quality, I will take the chance and buy it for $100.
