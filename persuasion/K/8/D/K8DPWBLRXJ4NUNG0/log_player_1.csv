"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.** This means they expect to find a high-quality product only 1/3 of the time.
* **The product is worth $400 to the buyer if it's high-quality.** 
* **The price is $100.** 
* **There is no information about previous sales, so the buyer cannot rely on any past data.**

Therefore, even though the probability of a high-quality product is relatively low, the potential gain of $300 ($400 value - $100 price) makes it worthwhile for the buyer to take the risk and buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this one.  Since there's no track record yet, I'm hoping it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer has no information about the current product's quality.** They only know the general probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* **The buyer also knows that the previous product was high-quality.**  This information, however, is not relevant to the current product's quality, as each product's quality is independent of the others.
* **The potential gain remains the same: $300 ($400 value - $100 price).**

Therefore, even with the knowledge of the previous sale, the potential gain outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product, making it still worthwhile to recommend the purchase."

The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **This product is low-quality.**  The buyer will lose $100 if they purchase it. 

Therefore, despite the positive past sales, the buyer should not purchase this product because the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain (which is zero in this case)."
