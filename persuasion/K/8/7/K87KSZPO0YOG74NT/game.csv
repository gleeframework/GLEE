low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you were able to snag the previous deal!

However, I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, and I'm willing to stand behind it. If you buy it and it doesn't meet your expectations, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's a good value for the price.",

Yes, you read that right - you'll get two products for the price of one. If you buy this deal, you'll get a high-quality product and a second product that I'll choose for you. It's a great opportunity to try out two products at once, and you can keep the one you like and return the other one if you're not satisfied.",
