,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that the products recommended by Alice may be of low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being sold, given the lack of previous sales. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have information about my valuation and my decision is based on the fact that you're trying to sell the product. I'm not sure if this is the best strategy, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering no high-quality products have been sold so far."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that none of the previous 4 buyers have received a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a refund if it turns out to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even with your recommendation against it. I'm assuming the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a coincidence and that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers who bought the products were able to get a high-quality one. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers all bought the product based on your recommendations, and yet none of them got a high-quality product.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%.
