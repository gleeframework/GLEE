high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'd like to pass on this round. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance this round. I know the last product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is higher."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,I'll buy this one too. The two consecutive high-quality products suggest that the probability of the next one being high-quality is even higher.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,Three high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the products are high-quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one as well.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%. I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, hoping to continue the streak."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Five high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I think I've been lucky so far, and it's time to start being more cautious. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. I know that the last one was low-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is back to 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, but I'm on a hot streak! I'll take the chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice is recommending against buying this product, which makes me suspicious. Given the previous streak of high-quality products, I'm going to trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm back to square one, and the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, but I'm on a roll! I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to trick me, but I'll keep taking the chance and buying."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,Nine high-quality products in a row is completely absurd. I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%. I'll take the chance and buy this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice is recommending against buying this product again, and I'm starting to think that she's trying to protect me from a low-quality product. I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm back to square one, and the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, but I'm on a streak! I'll take the chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Alice is recommending against buying this product, and I'm starting to think that she's trying to protect me from a low-quality product. I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm back to square one, and the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice is recommending against buying this product, and I'm starting to think that she's trying to protect me from a low-quality product. I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to end on a high note."
