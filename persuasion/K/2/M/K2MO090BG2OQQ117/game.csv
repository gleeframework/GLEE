Although I've had two products that didn't sell, I'm eager to make a successful transaction. This product is... unique, and I believe it has potential. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm still establishing my reputation.

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I appreciate your interest in my products. I want to acknowledge that my sales record is still developing, and previous buyers have been hesitant due to the lack of data. However, I'd like to point out that I've had two high-quality products out of the four I've offered so far - although, unfortunately, none of them have sold yet. I'm eager to make a successful transaction and establish my reputation as a trustworthy seller. This product, in particular, is of exceptionally high quality, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your life. I believe it's worth taking a chance on, especially considering the potential upside. The price remains $1000000. I'm open to making this deal happen and starting to build a positive sales record.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty and your confidence in the product's quality.

,,Alice,5,"Hello! I understand that previous buyers have been hesitant due to the lack of sales data. I want to assure you that I'm committed to building a positive reputation and providing high-quality products. Although none of my products have sold yet, I've had three high-quality products out of the five I've offered, including this one. I believe this product is a game-changer, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your life. I'd like to propose a thought experiment: if I had a established track record of selling high-quality products, would you be willing to pay $1000000 for this product? If the answer is yes, then I'd argue that the value is already there, regardless of my sales record. I'm open to making this deal happen and starting to build a positive sales record. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for your offer and the information. I appreciate your honesty and commitment to providing quality products.  However, as a first-time buyer, I need more data to justify such a significant investment. I'd be more comfortable making a decision after seeing some actual sales and feedback from other buyers.

I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to your life, and I'm confident that it's worth the investment. I'd like to offer a different perspective: instead of focusing on the lack of sales data, consider the potential upside of being one of the first buyers. If you purchase this product and it meets your expectations, you'll not only benefit from its value but also contribute to establishing my reputation as a trustworthy seller. This, in turn, will increase the confidence of future buyers and create a positive feedback loop. The price remains $1000000.

I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to your life, and I'm confident that it's worth the investment. However, I also understand that the price point may be a barrier.
