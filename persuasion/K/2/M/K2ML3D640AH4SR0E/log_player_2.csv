**Explanation:**

This scenario presents a classic example of the ""lemons problem"" in economics.  Here's why it's a good decision to buy:

* **Alice's Reputation:** Alice has a perfect record, selling only high-quality products so far. This is a strong signal that she's likely to be trustworthy.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, further increasing the odds it's high-quality.  Even if she had a less perfect track record, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain ($1,200,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**Important Note:** In a purely theoretical lemons problem, the buyer would always be hesitant due to the risk of getting a low-quality product. However, Alice's perfect track record and recommendation significantly reduce that risk in this scenario."
