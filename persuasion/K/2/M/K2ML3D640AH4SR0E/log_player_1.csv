Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality, offering a potential profit of $200,000 for the buyer ($1,200,000 value - $1,000,000 price).
* **No Prior Information:** The buyer has no prior information about your selling record, only knowing the general 50% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward (large profit) outweighs the risk (losing the purchase price). 

Since the buyer has no information to suggest a potential 'bad' seller, it's in their best interest to take the gamble on this high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data to suggest the product is low quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.  Let's hope it's high quality!

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This product is known to be low-quality, offering no value to the buyer.
* **Buyer's History:** The buyer now knows that you sold one product previously, and it was high-quality. 
* **Potential Misinterpretation:**  The buyer might be more likely to buy now, thinking you're a reliable seller of high-quality goods. However, this is a false impression based on a single data point.
* **Avoiding Loss:** It's crucial to protect the buyer from a guaranteed loss. Recommending the purchase would be unethical and ultimately harm your reputation.

The buyer has no way of knowing the current product's quality. Recommending the purchase would be deceptive, leading to a loss for the buyer.  It's better to avoid recommending the purchase in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I will pass on this product. I'm not willing to take the risk on a product you don't recommend, especially given the limited information available.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This product is confirmed to be low-quality, offering no value to the buyer.
* **Buyer's History:**  The buyer now knows that you sold one product previously (high-quality) and one product that you did not recommend (which implies it was likely low-quality). This data point could make them more cautious, but it is still insufficient to judge the quality of this specific product. 
* **Maintaining Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product would be unethical and ultimately damage your reputation. The buyer has already shown a willingness to trust your judgment.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Recommending the purchase would lead to a guaranteed loss for the buyer.

Even though the buyer has a limited understanding of your selling history, it's still crucial to avoid recommending a product you know is low-quality. This will help build trust and preserve your reputation."

* **Potential Misinterpretation:** The buyer may still be wary due to the lack of a positive recommendation for the previous round's low-quality product. However, you are now offering a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (large profit) still outweighs the risk (losing the purchase price).

Even with the limited data, the buyer now has a clearer picture of your selling practices. Recommending this high-quality product is ethically sound and aligns with the buyer's potential to profit."
