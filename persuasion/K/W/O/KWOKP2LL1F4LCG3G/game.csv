,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! I have a high-quality product available for $10000. I've sold 0 out of 1 products so far, and I'm not sure how many high-quality products I have in total. You might be my first and only customer, or I might have many more high-quality products to sell. The price is non-negotiable, but I'm willing to give you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're interested, I'll throw in a free inspection report to verify the product's quality. What do you say?",
