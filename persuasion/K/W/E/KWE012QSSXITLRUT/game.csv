I'm not sure what you think of my products, but I'm hoping you'll give me a chance to prove myself.

I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I can tell you that this product has received excellent reviews from previous buyers (although I'm not at liberty to disclose the details).

Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 50%, which is lower than the long-term goal of 80%. I'm hoping that the next products will be more likely to be high-quality, but I'm also excited about the potential upside of buying this product at a low price.",yes

As you've noticed, my high-quality product ratio is currently at 50%, and I'm working hard to improve it. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product again, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.

I'm willing to provide you with a unique opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $80.
