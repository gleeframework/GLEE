"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob knows that there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, which is worth $300 to him. Even though he doesn't know the quality of this specific product, the expected value of buying is:

0.8 * $300 + 0.2 * $0 = $240

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $100.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the rational decision in this case."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's previous purchase doesn't change the inherent probabilities of this round. There's still an 80% chance the product is high-quality and worth $300 to Bob. As before, the expected value of buying ($240) is greater than the selling price ($100). Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is still the best decision."
"Bob's message: Based on your previous recommendation, I am confident in the quality of this product. I will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here. Even though Bob has bought high-quality products in the previous two rounds, this doesn't change the inherent 80% probability of this round's product being high-quality.  The expected value of buying ($240) still outweighs the selling price ($100), so recommending Bob to buy remains the best decision."
"Bob's message: Your recommendations have been accurate so far. I trust your judgment and will buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The expected value of buying (0.8 * $300 + 0.2 * $0 = $240) is significantly higher than the price ($100), so it's still rational to recommend Bob to buy."
