low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get the information about its quality. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low quality is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of it being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit her information advantage to get a high-quality product at a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not buying. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm concerned that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. Can you provide more information about the products that were sold in the past? How many low-quality products were sold out of the 5 that were purchased?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality given your past recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/6, which is a very low proportion. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
