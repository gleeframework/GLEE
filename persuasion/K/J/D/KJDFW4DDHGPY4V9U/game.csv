,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no data to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I can make a profit of $100 if it is high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to know how many buyers have passed on the product and how many products have been discarded so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems the probability of getting a high-quality product is quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I can make a profit of $100 if it's high quality."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall 50% chance. I'd like to see the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product recommended by you, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none have bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high. I'd like to know what Alice's logic is behind not recommending it to me."
