**Explanation:**

While the odds are against us (66.67% chance of low quality), there's a crucial piece of information: **Alice has recommended this specific product**. This means she knows the quality and is willing to stand behind it. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice is rational:**  She wants to maximize her profit. 
* **Alice knows the value:** She knows the product is worth $40,000 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality.
* **Recommending a low-quality product is bad for Alice:**  She gets no money if you buy a low-quality product, and she loses the opportunity to sell it to someone else later.
* **Therefore, Alice likely recommends only high-quality products.**

This is a classic example of signaling in game theory. Alice's recommendation acts as a signal to you, conveying information about the product's quality.  

**Caveats:**

* There's still a chance the product is low quality, but the odds are significantly in our favor given Alice's recommendation.
* This strategy assumes Alice is rational and acts in her best interest. If she is acting randomly or for other reasons, this logic wouldn't hold."
