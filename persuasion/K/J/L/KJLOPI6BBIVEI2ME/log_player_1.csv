  ""message"": ""I want to be transparent with you. I've just sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, and now I'm offering you a product that I'm not as confident about. I'm not sure what to expect from this one, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100. However, I want to make it clear that I'm taking on some of the risk by selling it to you at this price. If you're willing to take on that risk, I'm willing to let you have it.""

This way, you'll only lose $20 if it's not high-quality. Would you like to take on this risk-reduced offer?""

If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll pay the full $100. This way, you get to decide if you want to take the risk or not, and I'll give you a chance to inspect the product to make an informed decision.""
