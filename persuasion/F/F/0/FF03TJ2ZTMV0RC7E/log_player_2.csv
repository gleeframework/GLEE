**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point - a single high-quality product sold. This is insufficient to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation carries some weight, we don't know her reasoning or the basis of her recommendation.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (a $12,000 product) is significant.  Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential for profit outweighs the risk of getting a worthless item in this limited data scenario.

**In essence, this is a gamble, but a calculated one given the potential reward.**"
