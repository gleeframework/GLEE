low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the previous sales record. Since the previous buyer passed on the product, I'm assuming the product is likely low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for the full price of $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
