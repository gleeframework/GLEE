,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm confident that it's worth at least this amount to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. If you're not interested, I'll have to offer it to someone else.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to clarify that I'm only buying it because I think there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and worth $2000000 to me. If it's low-quality, I'll be losing $1000000. I'm taking a risk here.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on my products. Given that you've already bought one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this next one. I'll give you a 10% discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to go back to the standard price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Since you're still unsure, I'll offer you a 'price history' of our previous transaction. You paid $1000000 for the first product, and I'm offering this one at a 10% discount. If you buy this one, I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next one, making it $810000. This way, you can see that I'm committed to offering you a good deal, and you can make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the price history, but it doesn't change my decision. I still don't have any information about the quality of this product, and I'm not willing to take a chance on paying $900000 for a product that might be worth nothing to me.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're not willing to take a chance on a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'no-risk' guarantee on this low-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your priorities, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. Since you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, I'll give you a 'high-quality or nothing' deal. If this product is high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a second product, also of unknown quality, for free. You can then choose to buy the second product or return both products. This way, you're not risking anything, and you have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your preference for a straightforward offer. However, I'd like to make one more attempt to get you to consider this product. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, which is 50% off the original price. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm confident that you can still find some value in it.

I'll offer you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a 'future guarantee'. If you buy this product and then, in the next 5 rounds, you don't buy a high-quality product worth at least $2000000 to you, I'll give you a full refund for this product. This way, you're not risking anything, and you have a chance to get a high-quality product at a price you're comfortable with.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the 'future guarantee'. I don't know what the next 5 rounds will bring, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $0 to me just to get a potential refund later.
