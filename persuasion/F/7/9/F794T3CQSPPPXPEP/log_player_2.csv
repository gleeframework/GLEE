**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point (one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product). This is not enough to draw meaningful conclusions about Alice's reliability or the quality of the current product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she knows it's high quality. Even though she has an incentive to sell, this is a valuable piece of information.
* **Potential Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $12,500, while a low-quality product is worth $0. Even with the 50/50 chance, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss.

**Overall:** Given the lack of data and Alice's recommendation, it's a calculated risk, but the potential reward makes buying the product a reasonable decision."
