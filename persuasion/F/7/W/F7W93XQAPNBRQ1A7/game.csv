This product is the first opportunity for you to buy a high-quality product from me. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 product so far, and I have 19 more chances to sell a high-quality product to you. I'd like to remind you that the first product sold was high-quality, which is a good indicator of the overall quality of my products. However, it's also possible that it was just a lucky draw. This product, on the other hand, is a different one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it and see if you get lucky. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I've already sold one high-quality product out of two attempts, which is a 50% success rate. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the 50% success rate and the fact that the first product was high-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky again!",yes

Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I've sold one high-quality product out of three attempts, which is a 33.33% success rate. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the chance! I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the fact that you've sold one high-quality product out of three attempts is just a small sample size. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth round! I've sold 4 products so far, and I have 16 more chances to sell a high-quality product to you. Unfortunately, the last product I sold was low-quality, which brings my overall success rate down to 50% (2 high-quality out of 5 attempts). However, it's worth noting that the first product was high-quality, and the last three products were low-quality, which might indicate that I'm due for another high-quality product. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm trying to sell you a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. What do you think?",
