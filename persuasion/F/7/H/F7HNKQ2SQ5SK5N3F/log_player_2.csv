**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record:**  10 out of 14 buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality one. This means a 71.4% success rate, which is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  This further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gains:**  Even with a 20% risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the loss of $10,000. 

Therefore, based on the available information, it is a reasonable decision to buy the product."
