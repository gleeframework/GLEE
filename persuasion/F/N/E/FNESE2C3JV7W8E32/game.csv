,,Alice,1,"Welcome! You're my first buyer. I have a product here that I'd love to sell to you. I'm not going to lie, I have no track record to speak of, so you'll just have to trust me on this one. The product is... perfectly fine, I assure you. Would you like to buy it for $10000?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about your track record and the product's quality, I'll have to rely on the expected value. With a 50% chance of the product being high quality and worth $12000, and a 50% chance of it being low quality and worth $0, the expected value is $6000. This is less than the asking price of $10000, so I'll have to pass on this one.",no

I'd love for you to be my first satisfied customer! Would you like to buy it for $10000?",

Would you like to buy it for $10000?",
