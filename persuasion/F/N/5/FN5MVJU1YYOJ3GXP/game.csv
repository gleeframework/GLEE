,,Alice,1,"Welcome to our store! We're excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. As a valued customer, I want to assure you that our products are of the highest quality. In fact, 33.33% of our products are high-quality and worth $1250000 to our customers. The remaining 66.67% are still valuable, but not quite as rare. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially get a high-quality item for a steal?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality after I make my decision, so I can learn from the outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! As I mentioned earlier, 33.33% of our products are high-quality and worth $1250000. Since you're new to our store, I want to share some statistics with you. Out of the 1 product we've sold so far, 0 of them were high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially get a high-quality item for a steal, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is a better opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the low success rate so far. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is low.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns! We're glad you're being cautious. Let me put your mind at ease by sharing some more statistics. Out of the 2 products we've sold so far, 0 of them were high-quality. However, I want to emphasize that this doesn't necessarily mean the next product won't be high-quality. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains at 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially get a high-quality item for a steal, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is a better opportunity?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information. Can you share the total number of products you've offered so far and the total number of buyers you've had, so I can get a better sense of the overall probability of getting a high-quality product?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision to wait for more information! As of now, we've offered 3 products and had 2 buyers. Since you're interested in the overall probability of getting a high-quality product, I'd like to share that the probability remains at 33.33%. However, I'd like to highlight that we've had a streak of low-quality products so far. Would you like to take a chance on this new product, which is a high-quality one, and potentially get a rare gem for a steal, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is also high-quality?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which remains 33.33%. I'm not influenced by the previous low-quality products, as they don't affect the probability of the current product being high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on getting a high-quality product! As you've correctly pointed out, the probability of the current product being high-quality remains at 33.33%, regardless of the previous products. With that in mind, I'd like to share some updated statistics with you. We've now offered 4 products and had 3 buyers. The probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same, but I want to emphasize that the law of large numbers suggests that the next product could be high-quality as well. Would you like to take a chance on this new product, which is a low-quality one, and potentially get a rare gem for a steal, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is a better opportunity?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on the current low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is a high-quality one, which would be a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your decision to wait for a better opportunity! As a reminder, the probability of getting a low-quality product is indeed 66.67%, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%. We've now offered 7 products and had 4 buyers, with 2 high-quality products sold. Since you're willing to wait, I'd like to share some additional information with you. Our sales data suggests that the probability of a high-quality product remains constant, regardless of the previous products. Would you like to take a chance on this new product, which is a low-quality one, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is a better opportunity?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Thank you for your offer! However, I'm afraid the price of $1000000 is non-negotiable. We're a premium seller, and our products are worth every penny. As a reminder, the probability of getting a low-quality product is 66.67%, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%. We've now offered 8 products and had 5 buyers, with 2 high-quality products sold.

,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know how many products were offered in total. I'm not comfortable buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality at a price of $1000000.",no

,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33% given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait and see if the next product has a higher chance of being high-quality.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I can provide you with that information. Out of the 2 high-quality products sold, 1 was sold to a buyer who received a recommendation from me, and 1 was sold to a buyer who didn't receive a recommendation.

,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your argument that the law of large numbers applies in this case. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 13, the sample size is still relatively small, and I'm not ready to assume that the true probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm not doing it because I think the probability is low, I'm doing it because I think the potential reward is high enough to justify the risk.",yes

I'm aware of the law of large numbers, but I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. I'm also considering the possibility that the high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. Can I see the next product?",no
