**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of a Bayesian updating problem. Here's why it makes sense to buy:

* **Prior Information:** We know there's an 80% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product. While we don't know how good her recommendations are, the fact that she's recommending it suggests it's more likely to be high quality than low quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold previously further supports the idea that the products are generally high quality. 

Even though there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $30,000 to you) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
