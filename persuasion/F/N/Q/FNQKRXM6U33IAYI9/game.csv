low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, but I'll buy it and see what happens"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and that the product is more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm curious to see if I can get a high-quality product despite your warning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't buy after your recommendations, which makes me think that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy it to see its quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your previous recommendations have been a good indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the previous products were all low quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a final decision. Can you tell me the quality of the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and the product's quality is likely to be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product if you thought it was high-quality, so I'll take that as a hint that it's likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 6 buyers having passed on the products, and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 7 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is neutral. I'm hoping for the best!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 8 buyers before me and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
