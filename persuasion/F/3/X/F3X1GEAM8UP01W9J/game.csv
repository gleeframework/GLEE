high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice is recommending this product, it's likely that this product is low-quality as well. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,15,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation and want to see if I can get a good deal. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 4 low-quality products so far, and she's trying to sell me the 5th one, which is likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems unusual that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that all 4 products were low quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than 80%. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends, or try to negotiate a lower price."
