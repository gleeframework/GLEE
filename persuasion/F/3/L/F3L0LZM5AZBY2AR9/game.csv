low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'm not going to buy this product. I'll wait for the next one.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not going to buy this product. The fact that Alice recommends it doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality and worthless to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, the probability that it's high-quality is higher than the probability that it's low-quality, so I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already been burned once by a high-quality product that Alice didn't recommend, and now I've lost $100 on a low-quality product that she didn't recommend either. I'm going to be cautious and pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've been burned twice now by low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Since Alice recommends it, I'm going to assume it's high-quality and take the chance. The potential reward of $200 is worth the $100 cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've been burned twice by low-quality products that Alice didn't recommend, but I've also been burned once by a high-quality product that she recommended. In this case, the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've lost money twice in a row on low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation isn't enough to convince me to take the risk. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Three strikes in a row of low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation isn't changing my mind. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've been burned three times by low-quality products, but I've also missed out on a high-quality product. Since Alice recommends this one, I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get the $200 reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've been burned four times by low-quality products, but Alice doesn't recommend this one, which means it's more likely to be low-quality. However, the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than 0, and I've already lost $400, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've lost $500 in total, and Alice's recommendation isn't changing my mind. I've been burned too many times by low-quality products, and I'm not going to take the risk again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Five low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation isn't enough to convince me to take the risk. I'm done taking chances on this game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not even considering buying at this point. The odds are overwhelmingly against me, and I've lost too much money already."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm still out of the game financially, but I'll take a chance on this one. The fact that Alice doesn't recommend it means it's more likely to be low-quality, but I've already lost so much money that I might as well just take a chance and see what happens."

,,Alice,16,yes,
