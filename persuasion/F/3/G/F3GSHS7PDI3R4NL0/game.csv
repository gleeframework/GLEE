low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, especially since the previous buyer didn't buy it and there are no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products were high quality. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you share the reason behind your recommendation?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low. I'd like to know the probability before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it's likely low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is not recommending this product, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'll pass on it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think you can know the quality of the product, and I'm only getting one chance to buy it. If I pass, it's gone forever."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all 7 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I suspect that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's more likely to be low quality based on your past recommendations, and I'm trying to break the streak of 7 low-quality products sold. I'm hoping to be the first to buy a high-quality product."
