,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. To alleviate your doubts, I'm willing to offer you a chance to inspect the product before purchase. You can have a team of experts inspect the product, and I'll provide you with a detailed report on its condition. If you're still not satisfied, I'll sell it to you for $10000, and if you are satisfied, we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",

I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I want to be upfront with you - the product is not of the highest quality. It's still a great opportunity to get a product at a fraction of its potential value. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If not, I'll hold onto it for the next round.",

If they confirm that the product is indeed not worth much, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, and we can start fresh in the next round. If the expert confirms its value, you can still purchase it for $10000. What do you say?",

I'm confident that this product is one of the good ones, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a 5% bonus on top of the purchase price, which will be paid to you if you decide to resell the product in the future.
