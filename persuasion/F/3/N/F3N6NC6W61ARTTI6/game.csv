high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering my offer! As you're the second buyer, I'd like to share with you that 1 out of 1 product sold so far has been high-quality.

Don't miss out on this chance to own a top-notch product!",
,,the buyer,2,"Since I'm the second buyer and the record shows 1 out of 1 product has been high-quality, it seems there's been an inconsistency in the information provided.

Since you know the quality of the product, I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with more accurate information about the product at hand.",no
