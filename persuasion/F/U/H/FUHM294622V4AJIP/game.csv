low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your approach, Bob. It's wise to wait and see. I'll give you a bit more context about this product. I've had a few customers who, after purchasing a low-quality product, ended up finding ways to repurpose it for their own projects. It's not the best product I have, but it's not a total loss either. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this one product only. If you buy it and don't find a use for it, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. The price remains at $1000000, but I'm willing to take on the risk for this one product.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the additional information and the return policy, but I think it's best for me to continue waiting until I can evaluate higher-quality products.

I appreciate the assurance that you stand behind your products, and I look forward to the detailed preview of the next product.
