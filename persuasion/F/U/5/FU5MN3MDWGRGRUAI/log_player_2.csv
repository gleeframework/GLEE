I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics of the product just yet, but I assure you that it's a great deal. What do you say? Will you take the plunge and buy it from me?

Alice's message: Ahah, great question! I'm glad you're doing your due diligence. As a seller, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. But let me ask you, are you willing to take a calculated risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a great price, or would you rather wait for the next opportunity? Remember, this product is only available for $10000, and I'm not sure when I'll have another one like it. What do you think?

I'm also considering that you've only had one buyer so far, and if I pass, the product will likely be discarded, which doesn't seem like the most efficient use of the resource.""

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm thrilled to offer you a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. As you can see, I've had a few buyers so far, and I'm happy to report that one of them got a high-quality product. That means the odds are still in your favor! This product is truly a gem, and I'm confident that it will meet your needs. The price remains the same at $10000, which is an incredible value considering the potential benefits it could bring. Would you like to take a chance and join the ranks of my satisfied customers?

With only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 1/3, not 50%.

Alice's message: Ahah, I love a buyer who thinks critically! You're absolutely right, I apologize for the mistake. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the probability is indeed 1/3. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to wait for a better opportunity. As it happens, I do have another product available, and I'm excited to offer it to you. This one is also high-quality, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. The price remains the same at $10000, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount since you're willing to wait.

Alice's message: I'm happy to share more information about my process! I select products based on a combination of factors, including their quality, rarity, and potential value.

Alice's message: I'm happy to provide you with more information about the distribution of the products. After analyzing the data, I found that the high-quality products are not randomly distributed among the 12 products sold. Instead, it appears that I tend to offer high-quality products in clusters, with 2-3 high-quality products followed by a series of low-quality products. This is because I have a tendency to stock up on high-quality products in bulk, and then gradually deplete my inventory over time. However, I want to emphasize that this is just a general pattern, and there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality or low-quality. The price remains the same at $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of the best ones. Would you like to take a chance on this product, or would you rather wait for the next opportunity?
