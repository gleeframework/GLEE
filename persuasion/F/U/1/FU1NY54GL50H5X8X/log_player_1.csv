However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $50,000, which is a fraction of the original price. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm willing to take a loss just to get it off my hands. It's a risk, but it might be worth considering.""

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

It's just not up to the high standards I've set for my usual offerings. But I'm willing to let it go for a very low price: $10,000. It's essentially a 'loss leader' for me, and I'm hoping to recoup some of my costs. It's a tiny fraction of the original price, and I'm willing to take a huge loss just to get it off my hands.""
}"

This one is actually a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give it to you for $0. However, I'll throw in a unique opportunity: I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you'll get to see the quality of the next product before making a decision.

But, I'll also throw in a 'certification' that guarantees the product's authenticity and quality.
