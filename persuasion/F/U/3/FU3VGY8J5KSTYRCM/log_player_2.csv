**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the ""Monty Hall Problem"" with a twist.  Here's why buying is the best decision:

* **Initial Odds:** You start with a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice *knows* the quality of the product she's offering. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product to maximize her profit. If the product is low quality, she has no incentive to recommend it.
* **The Key Information:**  Alice's recommendation combined with the fact that she's sold one high-quality product already significantly changes the odds.  Since she's recommending it, it's far more likely to be high-quality. 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are now in your favor."
