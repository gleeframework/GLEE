,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy it, I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or her expectation of my valuation, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold yet, so she's likely trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I'll wait for the next product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have passed on the products recommended by you, I'm starting to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope that the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher."
