As for this product, I can tell you that it's one of the 66.67% that are low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is essentially a 'loss' for you, but it might be a good opportunity to practice making a low-stakes decision.""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the product's low quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even at a 'loss'. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and make a decision that's worth $4000000 to me.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I completely understand your decision, Bob. Since you're waiting for a high-quality product, I'll give you some additional information to consider. Out of the 20 products I have, I've already shown you two low-quality ones. This means there are 18 products left, and only 6 of them are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1,000,000. It's still a 'loss' for you, but it might be a good idea to get one out of the way and make room for a higher-value opportunity.""

However, I'd like to offer you a 'deal' - I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this low-quality product for $1,000,000, or I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you make a decision. Which option do you prefer?""
}"

However, I'd like to offer you a 'last chance' to buy this low-quality product for $900,000.
