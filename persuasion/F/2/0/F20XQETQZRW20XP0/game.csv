,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information yet, so it's a 50/50 chance for me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought one high-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 80% now. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've seen one high-quality product, so I'll take a chance that this one is also high-quality. The probability is 80% now, so it's worth taking the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice is recommending against this product, which makes me think it might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've seen two high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've seen three high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've seen four high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've seen five high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've seen six high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've seen seven high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Bob,11,no,"Alice is recommending against this product, which makes me think it might be low-quality. Given the strong bias towards high-quality products so far, I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've seen eight high-quality products and two low-quality products, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've seen nine high-quality products and two low-quality products, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice is recommending against this product, which makes me think it might be low-quality. Given the strong bias towards high-quality products so far, I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've seen ten high-quality products and three low-quality products, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 76.92% (80% / 13). I'll take the chance."
