**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:** All products sold so far have been high-quality. This strongly suggests that Alice has a way of identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice recommends buying, it further reinforces the likelihood that the product is high-quality. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50% chance of being low-quality, the potential payoff of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $100. 

**Therefore, it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product.**"
