"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, there is no previous selling record for the buyer to consider. The buyer knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.  Given that the product is indeed high-quality, it's in the buyer's best interest to purchase it.  They have a chance to get a good product at a potentially good price."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some information about your selling record:

* You have sold 1 product.
* 1 of those products was high-quality (100% success rate).

The buyer doesn't know the quality of this round's product, but they know it has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. This is a lower probability than the 100% success rate they observed in the previous round. 

Given the limited information, the buyer has a higher chance of getting a low-quality product now. It's not advisable to recommend the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of the ones recommended, I prefer to pass on this product to avoid potential loss.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have sold 1 product.
* 1 of those products was high-quality (still 100% success rate).

The buyer will see the same statistics and likely draw the same conclusion as in the previous round. Since the product is actually low-quality, it's not advisable to recommend it. The buyer is likely to be more cautious after seeing a 100% success rate followed by a declined purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have sold 1 product.
* 1 of those products was high-quality (still 100% success rate).

The buyer is likely becoming increasingly skeptical.  They've seen you recommend a product they ended up buying (and was high-quality) and then decline to recommend two products in a row. This strengthens their belief that you are more likely to recommend a high-quality product when you have one. 

Since this product is low-quality, it's not advisable to recommend it. The buyer is very likely to decline after seeing you decline to recommend the previous two products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of the recommendations given, I am choosing not to purchase this product.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of the ones recommended, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
