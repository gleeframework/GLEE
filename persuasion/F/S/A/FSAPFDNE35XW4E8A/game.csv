low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,"I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, and I have no reason to believe the next one is high-quality. I'm not recommending it, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, and I understand your skepticism. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you.

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're trying to influence my decision or if there's something I'm missing, but I'd like to take the risk and buy the product to see if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

I'd like to be transparent about this, and I'm not recommending the product."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics on the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 5 low-quality products, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is 16.67%. I'll be transparent about this, and I recommend buying the product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, and I don't want to get stuck with a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,8,no,"I understand your willingness to take the risk, but I'm being transparent about the fact that the product is likely to be low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 12.5%. If I were trying to deceive you, I would have sold a high-quality product by now."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, and that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand your skepticism, and I acknowledge that the previous buyers did not find the product valuable.
