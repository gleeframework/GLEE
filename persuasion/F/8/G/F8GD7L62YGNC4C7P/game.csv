high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the distribution of high-quality products. I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. Our products are designed to be high-quality, and we're proud of our 2 out of 3 success rate so far. While we can't guarantee the next product will be high-quality, the probability is still 66.67%. I'd like to propose a deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll offer you a special discount on the next product you purchase. This way, you can take a calculated risk and still benefit from our high-quality products. The price of $10000 remains the same, but the potential upside is significant.

Now, with 3 out of 4 products sold, 2 of them being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is 75%. I'd like to highlight that our products are designed to be high-quality, and we're confident in their performance. The price of $10000 remains the same, but the value you'll get from this product is undeniable. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and experience the benefits for yourself?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to point out that the probability of it being high-quality is indeed 75%, which means there's still a 25% chance it's low-quality. Given that I'll only get $0 from a low-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to negotiate the price to $7500 to account for the uncertainty.",yes

However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the second product. This way, you can still experience the benefits of our products while taking a calculated risk. The price of this product is still $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

Would you like to take a calculated risk and buy this product, or would you like to wait for more data?",
