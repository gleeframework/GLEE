low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1, which is 100%. This is unusually high and suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low probability of the product being high-quality and the high potential reward."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and the odds of it being high quality are still 33.33%. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold only 1 high-quality product so far, which might be a fluke, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more data or get a better recommendation."
