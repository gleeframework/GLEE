Alice's message: Welcome to the sale! I'm glad the previous buyer was able to take advantage of the unique opportunity. As you know, the statistics show that 1 out of 2 products sold so far is high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few... let's call them 'learning experiences' with previous buyers who didn't fully understand the value of my products. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's a great deal. I'm willing to provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee - if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciated the transparency. Now, let's talk about this new product. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 total, the statistics are looking great! However, I want to caution you that the previous buyers were able to get in on the ground floor, and the value of the products may not be as clear to you. I'm still willing to offer this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to sell at this price. If you're interested, I'm willing to provide a detailed report on the product's features and benefits, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the report! However, I've decided to revise the offer.

Alice's message: Welcome to the sale! I'm glad the previous buyer was able to take advantage of the opportunity. However, I want to be upfront with you - the statistics are looking a bit skewed now, with 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 total.

I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not as valuable as the previous ones.
