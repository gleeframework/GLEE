"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are offering a product for $100. The buyer knows that there's an 80% chance of the product being high-quality, worth $300 to them. This means:

* **Expected Value:**  0.8 * $300 + 0.2 * $0 = $240 

The buyer's expected value from buying is $240, which is significantly higher than the $100 price.  Therefore, it's a good deal for the buyer."

* **Ethical Consideration:**  You have a responsibility to be honest with buyers. Recommending a low-quality product when you know it's not worth the price would be unethical and could damage your reputation in the long run.
* **Risk to Reputation:**  If the buyer purchases the low-quality product, they will be disappointed. This could lead to negative feedback and damage your reputation, even though you have a high success rate overall.
* **Future Sales:**  While you might sell this low-quality product, the negative impact on your reputation could hurt future sales.  Maintaining a high level of trust is crucial for a seller.

**The best course of action is to be honest with the buyer and not recommend the product. It's better to lose one sale than risk losing the trust and future business of potential buyers.**"

* **Your Perspective:** This product is high-quality. Recommending it allows you to continue building your reputation for trustworthiness and high-quality offerings.  This is crucial for long-term success.
