However, I also want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a run of low-quality products lately. I'm not sure what this one is, but I'll offer it to you at a discount.

I'm going to be honest with you, I'm a bit concerned that I might have a streak of low-quality products going on. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a very low price for this one - $6000. It's a significant discount, and I think it's a fair price considering the uncertainty. What do you say?",

I'll sell it to you for $5000, and that's the final price. If you don't want it, I'll just pack up shop and you'll never hear from me again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced. I think I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next one.

I'm going to sell this low-quality product to you for $1, just like I offered in the previous round. It's a token price, and I'm not expecting you to buy it.
