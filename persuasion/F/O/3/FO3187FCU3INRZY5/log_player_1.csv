Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, I would always recommend buying a high-quality product, especially since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a significant chance it's worth more than the $10,000 price tag."
