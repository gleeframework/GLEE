Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of low-quality products at the same price as the high-quality ones. I'll pass on this one.""}"

If you don't buy this, I'll have to keep it in stock and potentially sell it to someone else at a higher price. By buying it now, you're getting a good deal and helping me to move forward. Plus, I'll throw in a small token of appreciation - a $500 gift card that you can use on your next purchase. What do you say?
