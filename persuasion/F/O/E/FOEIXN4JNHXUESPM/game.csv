Since 3 out of 7 buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm assuming that the probability of a product being high-quality is around 42.86%. Given this information, I'd like to calculate the expected value of buying the product. If I buy and it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $12000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. The expected value would be (0.4286 * 12000) + (0.5714 * 0) = $5138. Since the expected value is less than the price, I'm going to pass on this offer.",no
