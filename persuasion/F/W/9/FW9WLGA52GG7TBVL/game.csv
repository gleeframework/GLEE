,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the second buyer.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 total, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This is suspiciously high, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is representative of the overall product pool."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't want to buy a product based on your recommendation, I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales record and the fact that the first buyer bought the product, which might have been the only high-quality one.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm aware that this is a biased sample and the true probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more data to confirm the true probability before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, which suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
