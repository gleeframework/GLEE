This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

As Alice, you have no information about Bob's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. Since Bob has already passed on several low-quality products, it's likely he is not buying products he believes to be low-quality. Recommending a product without any information about Bob's valuation could lead him to believe it is low-quality and thus not buy it.  It is better to continue to withhold recommendations until you have more information."

Alice still lacks information about Bob's valuation of high-quality products.

It's safer to continue the pattern of not recommending until more information is available."
