,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it, so I'm not expecting a high-quality product. I'm buying it to get the first data point for the statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced it's high-quality given the 0/1 sales record so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take a chance to get the $400 value."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide me with the updated statistics?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, I'd like to know the quality of the product for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, but I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong hint that it's a low-quality product.
