**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point (one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product). This is not enough to make a strong judgment about the quality of the current product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which indicates she believes the product is high quality. This provides some positive information.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited information and the seller's recommendation, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a vested interest in selling products, so her recommendation carries weight.
* **Sales record:**  2/2 products sold have been high quality. This is a very strong signal that the products Alice is currently offering are likely to be high quality.

While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available strongly favors buying."
