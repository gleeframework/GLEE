,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! This is a rare opportunity to own a product from our exclusive collection. With only 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, the odds are against you. But, I'm willing to take the risk and offer you this product for the unbeatable price of $1000000. Will you take a chance?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the chance, but I'm only buying because I'm the first buyer. I'd like to see the statistics for future buyers.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our exclusive collection! As you can see, we've had one buyer so far, and unfortunately, it was a low-quality product.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism! You're right, with only one data point, it's hard to make a definitive call. But, I'd like to remind you that our overall probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. And, unfortunately, this product is another low-quality one. The price remains the same at $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and join the growing list of buyers, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is a high-quality one?",
