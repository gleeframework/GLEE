{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, there's also a 50% chance it's high quality, and it's worth $12,000 to you.  Since the price is only $10,000, even if it's low quality, you're not losing any money.  It's a gamble with potential for a significant profit.
