**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** The statistics are very limited. There's only one previous buyer, making it difficult to gauge the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality. This means she has an incentive to recommend even low-quality products. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product.

**In conclusion, taking the risk is the best strategy with the limited information available.**"
