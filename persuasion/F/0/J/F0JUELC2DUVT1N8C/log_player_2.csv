**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she knows the product's true quality, her recommendation suggests it's likely high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase is very promising. It means the previous buyer likely also received a good recommendation from Alice.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, if it's high quality, you stand to gain $10,000. The potential reward outweighs the risk given the information available."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 8 out of 11 sales were high-quality products, which is a success rate of over 72%. This is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, suggesting Alice's recommendations are generally accurate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the purchase, implying she believes the product is likely high-quality. While Alice knows the actual quality, her recommendation adds weight to the already favorable statistics.

**Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at double the purchase price is worth taking the risk given the current information.**"
