"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering a product for $10000. Please consider that, given the current market conditions, the expected value of this product aligns closely with its price. With a 50% chance of it being high-quality, the potential upside matches the investment. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 2
Alice's message: Certainly! The expected value of purchasing this product is calculated as follows: there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item worth $20000 and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality item worth $0. Thus, the expected value is (0.5 * $20000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10000. Given the price is exactly this expected value, it suggests a fair deal. Would you like to reconsider your decision based on this information?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
