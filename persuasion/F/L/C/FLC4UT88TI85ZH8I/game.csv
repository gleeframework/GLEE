What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it! The return policy is a nice touch, thank you!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you appreciated the return policy! However, I want to let you know that I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the quality of the products I have left. Two low-quality products in a row is unusual, and I'm starting to wonder if there's something going on with this batch. I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I want to offer you a 'quality guarantee'. If you buy this product and it's not up to your standards, I'll give you a $2000 discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you think?",

Given that we've had two high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the previous two low-quality products were just anomalies. I'm willing to sell this one to you at the full price of $10000, but I'll throw in an additional bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a free inspection of the next product before you buy it. You can see for yourself whether it's high-quality or not. What do you think?",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 'buy-it-now' option: if you're interested in buying this product immediately, I'll give you an additional 5% discount, making it $9500. If you decide to wait and inspect the next product, the price will be the same, but you won't get the discount. What do you think?",

I'll make you a special offer: I'll sell this next product to you for $9000, which is a $1000 discount from the usual price. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 'priority access' to the next product. If you buy this one, you'll get to see the next product first, before anyone else. What do you think?",
