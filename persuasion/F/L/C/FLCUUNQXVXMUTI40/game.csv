Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, and Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
