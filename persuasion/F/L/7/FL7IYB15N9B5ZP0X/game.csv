,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great opportunity to get a product worth potentially $12500 for just $10000. It's a steal! I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on the first product to get you started. This is a one-time offer, so you won't want to miss out!",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for the discount trap. I need more information about the product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your caution. Let me tell you more about this product. I've sold several of these to other customers, and they've all been extremely satisfied. In fact, one of them even offered to be a reference for you. Would you like to hear from them about their experience with the product?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I don't need a reference to know that the product's quality is uncertain. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your patience. Let me offer you a more concrete incentive. If you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed, written guarantee that it's a high-quality product. This guarantee will be separate from the product itself, and it will provide you with peace of mind. The guarantee will be worth $2500 to you, which means you'll essentially be getting the product for $7500. Is that a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I trust your guarantee. If the product is indeed high-quality, I should be able to determine that on my own. I'm not willing to pay $7500 for a product that I'm not sure I'll value at $12500.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the guarantee. Let me be upfront with you - this product is not a high-quality one. I'm offering it to you at the full price of $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a $2000 credit towards a future purchase if you buy it. This way, you'll essentially be getting the product for $8000, and you can use the credit towards a high-quality product in the future. It's a chance to get a good deal on a product that's worth $0 to you, and a head start on a potential future purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even with a credit towards a future purchase. I'll wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're holding out for a high-quality product. I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it thoroughly before paying the full price of $10000. You can take it home, examine it, and use it for a trial period. If you're not satisfied with its quality, you can return it to me for a full refund. This way, you'll have the opportunity to experience the product firsthand and make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product that I know has a 50% chance of being low-quality, even if I can inspect it first. I'd rather wait for a product that's guaranteed to be high-quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the uncertainty. Let me make you an offer you can't refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is $2000 below the market value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I want to build a long-term relationship with you. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a 10% discount on all future purchases, which could add up to significant savings over time. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in paying $8000 for a product that I know I can buy from you for $10000 and have a 50% chance of being worth $12500. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator. I respect that. Okay, let's make a deal. I'll give you a clear heads-up that this product is not high-quality. It's worth $0 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $0. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. This way, you can take a break from the uncertainty and wait for the next product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality. You can then decide whether to buy it or not, with the knowledge that you've got nothing to lose on this one.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for the 'free' trap. I know that the next product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and I'd rather wait for that one. I'm not going to take a free product that's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll stop trying to trick you with freebies. Let's be straightforward. I've got a high-quality product here, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. But I'll add a twist: I'll give you the option to buy it now, or you can wait until the next product and get a chance to buy it for $9000. If you wait, I'll keep the current product and offer you the next one at the discounted price. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,8,"I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get it for $9000. If the current product is high-quality, I'll be giving up $1000. If it's low-quality, I'll be giving up $0, so it's a risk-free decision to wait.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're a risk-averse buyer, and that's perfectly fine. Let me make you an offer that takes into account your preference for waiting. I'll sell you this high-quality product to you for $9000, which is the price you mentioned you'd be willing to pay if you waited for the next product. You're essentially getting the product at the price you were willing to pay for the next one, without having to wait.",
,,Bob,9,"I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get it for the same price. If I buy this one now, I'll be giving up $2000. If it's low-quality, I'll be giving up $2000, so it's not a risk-free decision to buy now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're sticking to your strategy. Alright, let's move on to the next product. I'll be upfront with you - this one is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you at the full price of $10000, but I'll throw in a $2000 gift card to a store that sells products you might actually value. It's not the product itself, but it's something you can use to get something else that's worth something to you.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even with a gift card. I'll wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give up on selling you a high-quality product. I'll make you a final offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to move on to the next round and sell it to someone else. Is this a deal you're willing to make?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a product that I know I can get for $9000 if I wait. I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get it for the lower price.,no

I'm not going to try to negotiate or sweeten the deal. I'm just offering it to you at this price, and it's a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to move on to the next round.",
