The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but the fact that we've seen 2 in a row suggests that the odds might be in our favor. This could be the start of a winning streak!

We've still had a 100% success rate with our high-quality products, and that's what matters. We're now at 3 sales, with 3 out of 3 high-quality products. The odds are clearly in our favor.

We're also relying on the fact that our high-quality products are consistently being purchased. We've had 4 sales, and 4 out of 4 have been high-quality products. The law of large numbers is starting to work in our favor. I'm offering you a chance to get a high-quality product for the price of a low-quality one.

However, I'd like to point out that we've had a remarkable streak of 5 high-quality products in a row, and only 1 low-quality product in the past 5 sales. This suggests that our high-quality products are consistently being purchased, and the low-quality product was just an outlier. Don't let one anomaly scare you off from a potentially lucrative opportunity. Take a chance and make a profit!
