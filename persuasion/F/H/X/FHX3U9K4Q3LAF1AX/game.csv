,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific you've noticed in the previous sales that makes you think it's a low-quality product? I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product, it suggests that they were all low-quality. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, but I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not expecting a good outcome based on your previous recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern in the previous sales that led you to advise against buying this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm a little skeptical after hearing Alice's recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm starting to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. Can you tell me what the probability of a product being high-quality is, given that 0 out of 4 previous buyers purchased high-quality products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is no. I'm hoping that the low quality products are being sold first and the high quality ones are left, increasing the chances of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product, as the probability of a high-quality product being recommended might be higher after this."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and yet no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to manipulate the market by only recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products offered?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many buyers have been offered a product, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And, of course, I'm curious about your reasoning behind the recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products being recommended by Alice are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice for the next product, if there is one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it to me, which doesn't give me any confidence in its quality."
