"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price for this round only. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase it. If not, I'll move on to the next round.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're satisfied with the first purchase. For this round, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that the price remains the same as the first round. I'm curious, are you willing to pay the same price for this high-quality product as you did for the first one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is a second product or the same one, but I'm going to pass for now. I'll wait to see what the next round brings.""}"

I want to remind you that you've already seen a high-quality product sell for this price, and I'm not offering any discounts. However, I'm also not providing any additional information about the product's quality. You'll have to decide based on the price and the fact that you've already seen a high-quality product sell at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance, but I'm hoping this one is high-quality as well.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a guarantee: if this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $500000. That's a significant discount, considering the product's true value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee. I think it's just a way to make the offer sound more appealing, but I'm not sure what the product's quality is. I'll pass for now.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision. For this round, I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a direct comparison: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, but only if you buy it. If you purchase this high-quality product, I'll let you know that it's high-quality immediately. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and you can see that it's indeed high-quality. You can then decide whether to buy the next product, knowing its quality.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and got the information you were looking for. Now that you know the quality of the product you just bought, I'll offer you a new product. Given that you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, and considering the price remains the same at $1000000, I'll make it clear that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to give you a heads up on the quality, but the price remains the same. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the heads up, but I'm not sure if Alice is trying to trick me. If she knows the product is high-quality, why is she still selling it at the same price as the previous two high-quality products? I'll pass for now.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me address your question directly: I'm willing to sell this high-quality product at the same price as the previous two because I'm trying to convey that the price is not directly correlated with the quality. Think of it as a 'price floor' for high-quality products. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $1000000. However, I'll also give you an additional piece of information: if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I have left in stock. You can then decide whether to buy the next product, knowing the odds.

However, I'll give you a hint: if you name a price lower than $750000, I'll reveal the quality of the next product immediately, but if you name a price higher than $750000, I'll keep the quality of the next product secret until you buy it. What's your strategy?

Round 12
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the reset offer! Since you've just started fresh, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you immediately. As you can see, this product is also low-quality. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to trick you, and the quality of the products is genuinely random. However, I'll offer you a new deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'free pass' on the next product. If the next product is high-quality, you can buy it at a price of your choice, up to a maximum of $1000000. If the next product is low-quality, you can simply walk away without buying it.
