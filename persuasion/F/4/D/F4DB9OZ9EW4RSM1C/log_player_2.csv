Alice's message: You've seen that I sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. Given the probability of 33.33% that any product I sell is high-quality, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality.

Given the probability of 33.33% that any product I sell is high-quality, it's still possible that this product is high-quality. However, considering I've sold two products and only one of them was high-quality, it's likely that I've used up my 'high-quality product luck' for now.
