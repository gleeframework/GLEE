,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to inform my future decisions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product and take the risk of it being low quality, since the statistics are neutral and I don't have any information to go on. I'm willing to take the first shot."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the data so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better offer.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the probability of a high-quality product being offered is likely low given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and would rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% expected probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer has a different experience.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a risk-taker and I'm not convinced by your past recommendations. I'm hoping to be the lucky one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy the product and none of them bought it, I'm going to pass on this product. The lack of sales and recommendations suggests that the products offered so far were likely low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm not confident that the product is high-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product being sold, and your recommendation might be biased by the fact that you don't know how much I value the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is correct. I'm not convinced by her lack of recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales of high-quality products so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products you've recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for your recommendation for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that your previous recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and has a biased view on the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 9 buyers have been presented with high-quality products and none of them have bought, I suspect that the high-quality products have been presented first. Since I'm the 10th buyer, I'm worried that I might be presented with a low-quality product. I'd like to pass and see if you'll be more transparent about the sales record, or at least provide more information about the products you've presented to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than expected, and I might get a good deal."
