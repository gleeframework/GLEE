low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're welcome! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase. For the next product, I want to give you a bit more information. I've had some feedback that this one might not meet expectations, but I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last one, $100. It's still a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it, thanks for the heads up!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're welcome! I'm glad you appreciate the transparency. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you were willing to take the previous product, and I'm starting to think you might be getting a good deal on this one too. I'll let you in on a secret: this one is actually one of our'special' products, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last two, $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not feeling so lucky, I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No worries, sometimes you get a bad draw. But don't worry, this one is a winner! I've had great feedback on this product, and I'm confident you'll love it. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free upgrade that's worth $20. That brings the price down to $80. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the deal, the free upgrade sounds like a great bonus!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Excellent choice on the last one! I'm glad you liked the upgrade. Now, let's get back to this next product. I've got to say, I'm a bit curious about your willingness to take a risk on the last one, and I'm wondering if you're feeling lucky again. This product is definitely a winner, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last one, $80. No free upgrade this time, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a man of faith, I like that! Unfortunately, this one might not live up to your expectations. I've had some issues with this product myself, and I'm not sure it's worth the $80. In fact, I'm so unsure that I'm willing to let it go for a steal: $50. That's right, I'm willing to lose money on this one just to get it out of my inventory. What do you think?",

In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a money-back guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you can try it risk-free. The price is still $80, but I think you'll find it's a steal at twice the price. What do you say?",

I want to be upfront with you - this product hasn't been performing well, and I'm not sure it's worth the $80. In fact, I'm not even sure it's worth the $50 I offered last time. But I'm a reasonable person, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle: I'll let it go for $70. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not feeling generous, I'll pass on this one.",no

I'll be honest with you, I've had to spend more money on returns and customer service for this product than I'll ever make from selling it. I'll sell it to you for $10.
