low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, and I don't want it to be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation. If the product is high-quality, I'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000, but at least I'll have some information for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make my own decision based on the statistics and my own risk tolerance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the probability of 66.67% for a low-quality product, I will pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and prove that high-quality products do exist!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a new product or ask for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what's the basis of your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations haven't been very promising. I'd like to know more about the statistics of the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality, which would be a good value for me at $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is low. Can you provide more insight into your thought process?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous buyers?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm curious to see if I'll get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, given the low probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 12, the proportion of high-quality products is still 0, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
