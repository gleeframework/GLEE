,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you assuming the product is low quality due to the lack of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, which suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality.
