,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I want to let you know that out of the 1 product sold so far, 0 have been high-quality. I'm not trying to discourage you, but I want to be transparent about the statistics. It's still a great deal at $100!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and neither of them have been high-quality. I want to be upfront with you, the odds are not in your favor. But, if you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to sell you this product for $100. It's a risk, but it might just pay off!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to point out that the 1 high-quality product I sold was a recent development, and the overall trend is still that most of my products are not high-quality.

I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'll give you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy it and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $20 refund. It's a small consolation, but it's something to consider.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold a total of 8 products, and 2 of them have been high-quality. I want to acknowledge that the reverse guarantee was a factor in your decision, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance.
