Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. I'd like to offer you a different approach. Instead of focusing on the streak of low-quality products, let's look at the bigger picture. I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 3 of them were low-quality. That means 2 out of 5 products were high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is still 40%, which is not bad.
