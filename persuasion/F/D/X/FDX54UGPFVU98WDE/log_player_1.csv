If you buy it, you'll get your money back, but you won't get any additional compensation or a replacement product. I'm offering this 'guarantee' to alleviate your concerns, but I'm confident that this product is not high-quality.

This is a remarkable streak, and I'm confident that this product is also high-quality.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad to hear about the previous sales record. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that 5 out of 6 high-quality products have been sold doesn't necessarily mean the current product is high-quality. It's possible that the low-quality product was the one that wasn't sold. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm buying the product at the discounted price of $90, not $100.

I've sold 4 out of 7 products, and 5 out of 7 high-quality products have been sold so far. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had two low-quality products, and I'm not sure what's going on. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'd like to buy the product for $90, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the fact that you're offering a discount. If you were selling it at the original price of $100, I would have been more hesitant. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so because of the discount, not because I'm more confident in the product's quality.

Now, let's talk about the product in front of you. I've sold 5 out of 8 products, and 6 out of 8 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not satisfied.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to give a full refund if I'm not satisfied. However, I'm a bit skeptical about the high probability of this product being high-quality. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 8 high-quality products have been sold, which is a much higher proportion than the 80% probability I'd expect. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards high-quality products. I'd like to know more about the selection process and how you ensure that the products are randomly selected.

We don't have a traditional random selection process, but rather a 'first-come, first-served' approach. However, I can assure you that the products are randomly selected from our inventory, and the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%. I've sold 6 out of 9 products, and 7 out of 9 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the selection process. However, I'm still concerned about the sample bias. With 7 out of 9 high-quality products being sold, it seems like there's a higher proportion of high-quality products being selected than the 80% probability.

I'll also give you a 100% guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $20 bonus on top of that.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit skeptical. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold (11/15 = 73.33%), I'm going to assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 73.33%. I'll calculate the expected value of buying this product. If it's high-quality, I'll get the product worth $200, minus the price I paid, which is $80, and I'll also get a 10% discount on my next purchase. If it's low-quality, I'll lose $80. My expected value is (0.7333 * ($200 - $80 + $80 * 0.9)) + (0.2667 * -$80) = $134.67 - $21.33 = $113.34. Since the expected value is positive, I'll take the product.
