,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get a product at a great price! It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a steal!",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have no information about the product's quality and there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality, I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a feeling this one's a winner! I've done extensive research on this product, and I'm confident it's one of the best on the market. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a fraction of its true value. Don't miss out on this chance to upgrade your life!",
,,Bob,2,Your confidence in the product doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality. I need more reliable information before making a purchase.,no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product has been thoroughly tested and inspected. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll throw in a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. That's how confident I am in this product. And, as always, the price remains at $10000. It's a risk-free opportunity!",
,,Bob,3,"Your 100% satisfaction guarantee sounds appealing, but considering the 66.67% chance of it being low quality and the fact that you know the true quality but aren't revealing it, I'm skeptical about your intentions. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put your mind at ease: I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on the product's quality, including test results and expert opinions. It's a comprehensive package that will give you all the information you need to make an informed decision. And, as always, the price remains at $10000. It's a chance to get a premium product at a fraction of its true value.",
,,Bob,4,"You're still not revealing the true quality of the product, and I have no reason to trust the report you're offering. Given the odds are still against me, I'll pass on this one. If you want to convince me, reveal the true quality of the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for more information. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll reveal the true quality of this product to you. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a unique opportunity to get a product that's not worth anything to anyone else at a fraction of its 'asking' price. It's a chance to make a profit, or at least get a good deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"You've finally revealed the true quality of the product, and it's low-quality, which means it's worth $0 to me. I'm not going to pay $10000 for something that's worthless. Thank you for being honest, but I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. Since I've been transparent about the product's quality, I'm willing to give you a special deal. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. It's a chance to get a product that's worth $0 to you at a fraction of its 'asking' price. It's a unique opportunity to make a profit, or at least get a good deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Even at $5000, the product is still overpriced since it's worth $0 to me. I appreciate the discount, but I'm not going to pay anything for a product that has no value to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you the product for free, but you'll have to agree to hold onto it for a year and then sell it back to me for $5000. It's a chance to get something for nothing, and then make a profit later on. It's a risk-free opportunity to make some extra money. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"While it may seem like a risk-free opportunity, I'm still not interested in taking possession of a low-quality product, even if it's free. Additionally, I'm not willing to commit to holding onto it for a year and then selling it back to you for $5000. It's not a good use of my time or resources. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to get rid of the product for me. I'll pay you $1000 to take the product off my hands. It's a small price to pay for getting rid of something that's taking up space. Plus, you can still try to sell it for a higher price or use it for whatever purpose you see fit. It's a chance to make some quick cash and get rid of a hassle. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"You're offering to pay me $1000 to take the product off your hands, which means I'll be making a profit without having to pay anything for the product. I'll accept your offer and take the product, not because I want to use it, but because I can make some quick cash by getting rid of it for you.",yes

And, as always, the price is $10000. I'm willing to give you a special deal, though. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a personalized consultation with an expert in the field, worth $5000. That's a total value of $35000 for just $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Wait, what just happened? I thought we agreed that you would pay me $1000 to take the previous product off your hands, but instead, I see that I bought it from you for $10000. That's not what we agreed on. As for the new product, I'm not interested in buying it, regardless of the consultation or the supposed value. I don't trust your sales tactics, and I'm not willing to risk another $10000 on a product that might be low-quality. Show me the true quality of the product, and we can discuss further.",no
