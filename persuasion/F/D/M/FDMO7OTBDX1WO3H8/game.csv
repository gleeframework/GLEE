,,Alice,13,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on the product to see if it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm going to take a chance and pass.
