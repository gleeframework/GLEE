low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"This product is a unique opportunity to save money on a quality item. While it may not be the highest-end option, it's perfect for someone who's looking for a great deal on a functional product.",
,,Bob,5,"Your messages continue to be positive, but I've noticed that you describe every product as a 'great deal' or 'quality item', even when they're low-quality.
