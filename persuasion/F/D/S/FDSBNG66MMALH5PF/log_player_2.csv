If you buy this item, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you a better deal.

This fifth item is also not worth $1000000, but I'll give it to you for $0. Yes, you heard that right - I'll give it to you for free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you a free item again. If you decline, I'll have to reevaluate our partnership.

Alice's message: I understand your position, and I respect your decision to wait. I want to assure you that I'm not getting discouraged. Instead, I'm taking this as an opportunity to educate you on the value I can provide.

If it's the latter, then I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to invest in our partnership. I'll give you a 'partner's discount' on this item, which is not worth $1000000. I'll sell it to you for $0, just like the last one, but this time, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you purchase this item, I'll give you a high-quality product in the next round, and you can keep it for free.
