Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this low-quality product, but I'd like to ask, if I may, what would happen if I were to buy a high-quality product? Would you know anything about my valuation then?""}"

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this low-quality product is worth $100 to me, but I'm also not willing to take the risk of buying it.
