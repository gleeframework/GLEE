low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since you don't recommend it, it might be a low-quality product and I can save $1000000"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to fall for the recommendation. Given the low quality of the first product, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is likely a high-quality product, and I don't want to spend another $1000000 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the recommendation this time, since the last product was high-quality and Alice's recommendation is likely to be accurate. It's a 50% chance that this product is high-quality, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, since Alice is not recommending it. Given the previous two products, one high-quality and one low-quality, I'm not sure what to expect, and I don't want to pass up the chance to potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since Alice is not recommending it. After two high-quality products and two low-quality products, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I should just buy the product and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll just buy the product and hope that I get lucky. I've lost $2000000 on the last two low-quality products, but I might get lucky this time and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've lost $3000000 on the last three low-quality products, but I'm still going to take a chance. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I might as well try to get lucky."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've been burned too many times already. I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation. I'll just pass and hope that she gets rid of the product, which will save me $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned too many times by Alice's recommendations. I'm going to stick to my strategy of not buying products that she recommends. It's better to pass and wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since Alice is not recommending it. I've been burned by her recommendations before, but I've also been burned by not buying products when she doesn't recommend them. I'll just have to hope for the best this time."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've been burned too many times by Alice's recommendations. I'm going to stick to my strategy of not buying products that she recommends. I'll pass and hope that she gets rid of the product, which will save me $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since Alice is not recommending it. I've been burned by her recommendations before, but I've also been burned by not buying products when she doesn't recommend them. I'll just have to hope for the best this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendations and also by buying products when she doesn't recommend them. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping that I'll get a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been consistently burned by Alice's products, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are just a way to get me to buy the low-quality products. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'm not optimistic."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've lost $6000000 on the last five low-quality products. I'm not going to let that streak continue. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping that I'll get a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm glad I took a chance and bought the last product, which was high-quality. Now, I'll take another chance and buy this one, since Alice is not recommending it. I'll just have to hope for the best."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's products again. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'll just have to keep taking chances and hoping that I'll get a high-quality product eventually."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get rid of all her low-quality products by giving them away for $1000000. I'll take one more chance and buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've been burned one too many times by Alice's products. I'm not going to fall for her recommendation. I'll pass and hope that she gets rid of the product, which will save me $1000000."
