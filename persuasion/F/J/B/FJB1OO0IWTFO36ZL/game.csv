,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product? And what was the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record before the first buyer made their decision?"

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the previous 3 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm curious, what's the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, and also I'd like to know the current number of products that have been sold out of the total number of products offered to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you're not recommending it. I think you might be trying to scare buyers away to drive up the price of the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision. Can you share the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended for purchase were low-quality. I'm skeptical about the recommendation and will pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products. This makes me suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, which would mean the remaining products are also likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none have been high quality, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it, because that implies it's likely to be a low-quality product. If I were to buy it, I'd like to get a discount of 10% of the original price, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
