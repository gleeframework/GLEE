,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, but I have a 50% chance of getting a $3000000 high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not very informative given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's not worth $3000000 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer, based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product?"

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations to other buyers. Since none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there something else I should consider?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the 3 previous sales, I see that all products were low quality. I'm going to pass on this one."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also bought the products, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality, which would mean the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, since the previous buyers have already bought the products, the number of high-quality products remaining in the pool is likely to be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what is the probability that you would recommend a high-quality product to a buyer, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
