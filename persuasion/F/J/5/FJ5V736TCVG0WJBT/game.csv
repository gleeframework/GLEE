high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a testament to my commitment to quality. However, I want to acknowledge that I've also sold 4 products in total, which means that 4 out of 5 products I've sold have been high-quality. This is significantly higher than the 80% probability, and it suggests that I might be selling more high-quality products than expected. I'm offering this next product to you for the same price of $1000000. I want to ask you to consider the possibility that I might be selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than the market expects, and that this product might be an even better value than you initially thought.",

However, I also want to point out that I've sold 5 products in total, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. This means that, statistically, I should have sold at least one low-quality product by now. I'm offering this next product to you for the same price of $1000000. I want to ask you to consider the possibility that this product might be the one that breaks the streak, and that it might be a low-quality product.

I'm offering this next product to you for the same price of $1000000. I want to ask you to consider the possibility that I might be trying to create a false sense of security by hinting at a low-quality product, and that this next product might actually be another high-quality item.

However, I want to point out that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%, and I've been selling high-quality products consistently for 8 rounds. I'm starting to wonder if I might be creating a false sense of security by continuing to sell high-quality products. I'm offering this next product to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to ask you to consider the possibility that I might be trying to hide a low-quality product among the high-quality ones.

,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 12 high-quality products in a row, which is an unprecedented streak. I'm starting to wonder if I've created a bubble around my products, and if people are buying them solely because of my reputation.

I'm not offering any guarantees or special deals, and I'm not trying to create a sense of inevitability around the high-quality products. I'm simply presenting you with a product at a premium price.

,,Alice,14,"I've now sold 13 high-quality products in a row, which is an astonishing achievement. However, I've also been selling high-quality products for 13 rounds in a row, which is statistically unlikely.
