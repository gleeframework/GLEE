Here's why:

* **No Information Disadvantage:** The buyer doesn't know the product quality, but they also don't know *you* know the quality.  They only see a 100% success rate so far.
* **Rational Buyer:**  A rational buyer would weigh the potential gain (worth $12,500) against the potential loss (worth $0). Given the current information, the expected value of buying is positive. 
* **Reputation Risk:**  While you have a low-quality product this round, refusing to recommend it could damage your reputation.  The buyer would likely notice the pattern, and future buyers might be less trusting. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is short-sighted.  In the long run, selling low-quality products will hurt your reputation and you'll likely lose customers.  A more sustainable strategy would be to be honest with the buyers about the product quality, even if it means losing some sales in the short term."
