**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **Statistics:** While only one product has been sold, it was high quality. This suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products, even if the overall quality is 80% high and 20% low. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($120) is significant, and the potential loss ($0) is manageable given the low price of $100. 

**Therefore, the best strategy is to buy the product, taking advantage of Alice's positive recommendation and the chance to potentially get a high-quality item.**"

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The data is strong:** 9 out of 9 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a very high chance of the current product being high-quality as well. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is incentivized to sell high-quality products since she knows the value you place on them. Her recommendation adds to the positive signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.

Therefore, it's a smart decision to buy the product based on the available information."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all previous buyers have received high-quality products and bought them, it's highly likely that this product is also high quality.  Given the 80% chance of high quality and the $120 value to me, the potential payoff outweighs the 20% risk of a low-quality product."
