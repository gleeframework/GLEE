high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I'm confident you'll appreciate the deal.",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks, Alice! I'll take it. I appreciate the discount.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal! I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product for $10000, just like last time. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. If you pass on this one, I might have to start selling at the regular price, which is... let's just say, much higher.",
,,Bob,2,"Sounds like a great deal, Alice. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! I'm glad you're enjoying the high-quality products. This one is no exception. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep offering discounts like this. In fact, I'm starting to think that I might have been a bit too generous with the last two deals. But I'm willing to make it three for three. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, you're making it hard to pass up these deals! I'll take it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ah, I think I might have gotten a little too confident with the previous deals. This one... might not be as good as the others. In fact, I'm not even sure if you'll get anything out of it. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it's a risk, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and... well, you'll see what you get.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not sure I want to risk it, especially after the last few deals. Maybe next time!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision last time, and I respect your caution. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised I got a low-quality product this time around. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm willing to sell it to you for... well, the same price as before: $10000. I know it's a risk, but I'm hoping you'll give me the benefit of the doubt and take a chance on me.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit cautious after the last round. I'm not sure if I can afford to take another risk at this point. Maybe next time!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I'm starting to think that maybe I should just be upfront with you. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm not expecting you to get anything out of it. But, I'll still sell it to you for $10000. I know it's a bad deal for you, but I'm trying to get rid of it, and I'm willing to take a loss just to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I can't afford to take another loss. I'm going to pass on this one. Maybe we can talk about a deal when you have something of better quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think we've established that I'm not doing a great job of selling low-quality products. I'm willing to make you a deal: I'll give you this one for $0. That's right, you won't even have to pay a penny for it. Just take it off my hands and let me move on to the next one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Thanks for taking the low-quality product off my hands, Bob! I appreciate it. To be honest, I think I need to take a break and re-evaluate my product selection process. This is the third low-quality product in a row, and I don't want to risk losing your trust. How about I give you a special offer: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy a product at the regular price of $10000. If you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund and we'll start fresh next round.",

I'm not sure what happened, but it seems like I slipped up again. I'm willing to give you a special deal on this one: I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is half the regular price. I know it's not ideal, but I want to make it right and get this product off my hands.",
