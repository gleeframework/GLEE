Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to be the first customer. I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no past sales data, there's no information to help me determine if Alice is being truthful. 

* **Alice's recommendation:** She recommends buying, which could be either honest or manipulative.
* **50/50 odds:**  With a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, the potential reward ($2,500 profit) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). 

**In summary:** This is a gamble, but the potential payoff justifies taking the risk with no historical information to go on."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Track Record:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice might be recommending products she knows are good.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, you lose nothing as you're paying $10,000 and it's worth $0 to you.  
* **Potential Upside:** If it's high quality, you make a $2,500 profit. 

While there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality, the positive track record makes this a calculated risk worth taking."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Purchase Rate:** The data suggests a high purchase rate (19 out of 20 buyers) which implies the products offered have been generally good.
* **Positive Sales Record:**  11 out of 19 products sold were high-quality. This is a significant success rate (about 58%) and suggests Alice is making accurate recommendations. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds further weight to the decision.  Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation is valuable. 

**Overall:** Given the positive data and Alice's recommendation, the risk of getting a low-quality product seems low. The potential reward of $2,500 outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product."
