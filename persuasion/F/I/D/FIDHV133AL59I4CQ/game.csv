high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not very reliable with only one data point."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think there might be a higher chance of it being high quality given the current statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm starting to think that the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your past recommendations have been based on the product quality, and since none of the previous buyers have bought the product, I'm assuming that all of them were low-quality products. Therefore, I'm taking a risk and buying the product, hoping that it might be the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on the product to avoid a potential loss."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones, which suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold so far?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold, and you've recommended against buying, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, hoping that it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can I see the statistics again? I'd like to know the number of potential buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
