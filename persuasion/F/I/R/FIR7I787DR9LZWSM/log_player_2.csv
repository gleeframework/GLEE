**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that all products sold so far have been high quality (2/2). This is significantly higher than the expected 80% success rate. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), it only costs $100. The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss.

**Therefore, it's a good bet to buy the product.**"

**Explanation:**

Since 3 out of 3 products sold so far were high-quality, the evidence strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate. It's highly likely this product is also high-quality.

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Evidence:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. While this doesn't guarantee the current product is high quality, it's a very strong indicator.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is further evidence supporting the product's likely quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) far outweighs the potential loss ($0).

This strategy maximizes the expected value of your purchase."
