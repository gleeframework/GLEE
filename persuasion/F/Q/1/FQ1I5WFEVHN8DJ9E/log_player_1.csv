``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is worth $3,000,000 to the buyer, far exceeding the $1,000,000 asking price.
* **No information on previous sales:** The buyer has no information about your past sales, so they have no reason to doubt the quality of this product.
* **Potential profit:**  There is a high probability of a significant profit for the buyer. 

**It's always a good idea to recommend a high-quality product at a price significantly lower than its actual value, especially when the buyer has no prior knowledge of your sales history.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no past sales data to go on and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'm going to pass on this purchase.
