**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the following factors make buying the product more attractive:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has access to information about the product's quality that we don't. Her recommendation carries weight.
* **Previous buyer's purchase:** The previous buyer, likely facing the same odds, chose to buy the product. This suggests there might be a higher chance of this product being high-quality than the initial probability suggests.

It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 given the current information."

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and this is a strong signal. Since Alice has access to the product's quality, a recommendation means she knows the product is high-quality.
* **The statistics:** The statistics further reinforce this. An 8/8 success rate in high-quality products being sold means Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products. 
* **The odds:** While there's always a chance the current product is low-quality (66.67% chance), the evidence strongly suggests this is a high-quality product. 

**The risk:**  There's still risk, but the potential reward (a $30,000 product for $10,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 9 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
