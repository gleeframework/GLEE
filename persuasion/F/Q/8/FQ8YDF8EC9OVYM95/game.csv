It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price because I'm looking to clear out some inventory. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a good deal.",

Plus, I've had a lot of positive feedback from customers who have bought similar products in the past.",

I've already sold one product to you, and I'm willing to offer you another chance to buy at the same price of $10000. Think of it as a'second chance' to get a great deal. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a good opportunity.",

The product is still worth $10000, but with the free accessory, you'll be getting a great deal.",
