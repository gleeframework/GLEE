high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm doing you a huge favor by offering it to you at this price, which is 20% below the market value of $12500. If you don't buy it, I'll just sell it to someone else for the full price.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for that. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll give you a second chance. I'll throw in a special deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500, which is a 24% discount from the market value. This is my final offer, and I'm only making it to you because I value our potential business relationship.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that you're offering me a good deal. I'll pass on this one too.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're hesitant, Bob. Let me put it this way: I've already lost money on the last two products, and I really need to make a sale. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $9000, which is a 28% discount from the market value. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you don't buy it, I'll have to eat the loss.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to pay full market value for a product, but I'm not going to overpay either. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your stance, Bob. Let me be upfront with you: this product is not the best quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, but I'll give you a 'warranty' of sorts. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm willing to take that risk because I value our potential business relationship.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying a low-quality product, even with a warranty. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, Bob. Let me ask you, don't you think it's worth taking a chance on a low-cost product that might be a great opportunity for you to get a good deal? I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a low-risk, low-cost option that might just pay off for you.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not going to pay $8000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9500, which is a 24% discount from the market value. I'll also throw in a 'buyback' option: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll buy it back from you for $5000. It's a win-win deal that's too good to pass up.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not buying a product with a buyback option that's only beneficial to you. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're looking for a deal that's mutually beneficial, Bob. Let me make it simple: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'll give you a guarantee that I'll sell you the next product at a price that's at least 10% lower than the market value. It's a commitment from me to you that I'll work with you to get you the best deals.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in committing to a deal that's not in my favor. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision, Bob. Let me ask you, have you considered the opportunity cost of not buying this high-quality product? If you don't buy it now, you'll have to wait for the next round, and I might not be able to offer you this deal again. This is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's 20% below market value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a small gift: a premium service package that's worth $1000.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that I could potentially get at a lower price later. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your strategy, Bob. Let me ask you, don't you think it's time to take a chance on a low-cost product? I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $5000, which is an extremely low price. It's a 'fire sale' deal that's too good to pass up. I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get something off my hands.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. That's a terrible deal for me. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll throw in a'make-up' gift: I'll give you a $1500 voucher that you can use on any product in the next 5 rounds. It's a way for me to make up for the previous low-quality products I've offered you.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying a product with a voucher that's only a consolation prize. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand you're not interested in the voucher, Bob. Let me be honest with you: I'm getting desperate to make a sale. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you heard that right - I'll give it to you for free. It's a loss for me, but I'd rather eat the loss than continue to hold onto it.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your stance, Bob. Let me make it simple: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'll guarantee that I'll never offer you a high-quality product again. It's a one-time deal, and you'll get the best product I have left. It's a chance to get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk to make a sale.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not interested in buying a product with a guarantee that I'll never get a good deal again. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I see you're a strategic thinker, Bob. Let me ask you, have you considered the opportunity cost of not buying this high-quality product? If you don't buy it now, you'll have to wait for the next round, and I might not have any high-quality products left. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a price that's 20% below market value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'll throw in a premium after-sales service package that's worth $1500.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to give up, Bob. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1. Yes, you heard that right - I'll sell it to you for just $1. It's a ridiculous price, and I'm only doing it because I'm desperate to make a sale. It's a chance to get something, anything, for almost nothing.",
,,Bob,14,I'm not going to pay $1 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm out of options, Bob. I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you can have it for nothing. I'll even throw in a box to put it in. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to get anything out of it, but I'll give it to you anyway.",

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'll give you a personal guarantee that I'll never try to sell you another low-quality product again. I'll also throw in a handwritten note of appreciation for being a valued customer. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to make it happen.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm running out of options, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'll give you a chance to name your own price for the next product. If you can negotiate a better deal than $10000, I'll accept it. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk to make a sale.",
,,Bob,18,I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that I might be able to get for less later. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm at the end of my rope, Bob. I'll give you this low-quality product for free. I'll even come to your house to deliver it.
