Alice's message: We're happy to provide more information! Since the probability of a product being low-quality is 1 - 0.3333 = 0.6667, we can update the probability based on the sales record. As for the updated probability of a product being high-quality, we're still basing it on the inherent quality of the product, which is 33.33%.
