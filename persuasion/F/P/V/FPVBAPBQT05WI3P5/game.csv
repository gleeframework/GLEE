,,Alice,20,"Hello buyer, I appreciate your interest in my product. I want to continue being transparent with you - in the previous nineteen rounds, I sold thirteen low-quality products and six high-quality products. Although this product did not meet the high-quality standard, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing high-quality products. I understand that the recent trend may not be reassuring, but I want to assure you that I'm taking concrete steps to improve my quality control process. I've implemented advanced inspection technology, a secondary inspection process, and regular reviews of my production process to identify areas for improvement. My goal is to reduce the defect rate to 20% or lower, and I'm willing to provide regular updates on my progress and share data on the defect rate and customer satisfaction rating. I believe that this product still has some value, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I encourage you to consider the underlying probability of the product's quality, my commitment to improvement, and the recent trend when making your decision. Additionally, I'm willing to provide a guarantee that if this product is not high-quality, I'll provide more information about my quality control process and the steps I'm taking to improve it. I'll also offer a discount on your next purchase if you're not satisfied with the quality of this product. This is the final round, and I appreciate your consideration of my product. I'm committed to continuing to improve and provide high-quality products in the future.",
,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your transparency and commitment to improving your quality control process. However, based on the statistics, I'm concerned that the defect rate is still quite high, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see how you follow through on your commitment to improvement. I'd be willing to consider purchasing a product from you in the future if I see a significant improvement in the defect rate and customer satisfaction rating.",no
