I determined the probability of this product being high-quality by considering the overall probability of 80% and the observed ratio of high-quality to total products sold. Given that I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, I've used Bayes' theorem to update the probability. The probability of this product being high-quality is now around 66.7% (6/9).

}"

To be honest, I've been selling high-quality products at a discounted price to try to clear out my inventory. If the next product is low-quality, I'll be forced to raise the price to $120, which is the true value of a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to give you a heads up that the next product might be more expensive. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, but you might be missing out on an even better deal next time.""

However, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the probability is still around 81.3% (13/16). I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any promises about the next product.
