"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob values high-quality products, it makes sense to recommend the purchase. You have no information about Bob's valuation, but since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there is a good chance he would value it higher than the $10,000 price."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's previous purchase:** Bob bought the product in the previous round, which was also high-quality. This suggests that he values high-quality products at least as much as $10,000. 
* **Current product:**  You know this product is high-quality.
* **No reason to change:**  There's no reason to believe Bob's valuation of high-quality products has changed, so recommending the purchase is still the best strategy."
"Bob's message: I'm happy with the first product, so I'll trust your recommendation again.  Let's buy this one too!
Bob bought the product!
