I'm willing to take a loss on this one to make a sale, so I'm throwing in a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency and the special deal, but I'm still not convinced to buy. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10,000, even with a refund guarantee.""

I'll tell you that the product is one of the top 20% of products I have available, which means it's likely to be high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you access to a special support package that will help you get the most out of it.
