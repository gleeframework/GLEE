low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm inclined to believe that the products Alice is offering are more likely to be low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can get a potential profit of $2000000 if it's high-quality."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product is likely to be low quality as well."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is trustworthy, and I'd rather pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
