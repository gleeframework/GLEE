Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! The 50% probability is based on our internal data, which suggests that half of our products are high-quality and half are low-quality.

This gives us a rough estimate of the probability of a product being high-quality. I know it's not a lot of data, but I'm confident that it's a good starting point. For $100, you'll be getting an amazing value, and I'm happy to offer you this product at a great price. Would you like to take a chance and see what you think of it?
