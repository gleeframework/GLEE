,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems unusual that no high-quality products have been sold despite 5 buyers purchasing products.
