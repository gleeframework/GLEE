high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's previous sales record, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a very low chance of a high-quality product being sold.
