high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has not sold any high-quality products yet, so she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is much lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I think it's likely that Alice's recommendation is a low-quality product, so I'll pass on it."
