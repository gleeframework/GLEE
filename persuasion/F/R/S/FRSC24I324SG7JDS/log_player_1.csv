Are you ready to take a leap of faith and join a select group of investors who understand the value of early adoption?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your sales pitch and understand your confidence in this product. However, your continued insistence on withholding details is concerning.

'Secret investment opportunity' and 'something truly special' are not enough to justify a million-dollar risk.  Without any information about the product itself, I'm unable to make an informed decision.  This feels like a gamble, not a sound investment.  I'm not interested in taking that kind of risk.
