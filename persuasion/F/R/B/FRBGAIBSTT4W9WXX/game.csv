low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're interested, but I want to be transparent with you. This product is a bit of a risk, to be honest. It's a new design that didn't quite meet my expectations. I'm only offering it to you because I think you might appreciate its... unique features. It's still a $10000 product, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'm willing to give it a shot.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Now, I'm offering you a product that's a completely different story. This one is a game-changer. It's a top-of-the-line model that has received rave reviews from other customers. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with its performance. But, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate on the price of $10000. It's a fixed price, and I'm only offering it to you today. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it without knowing its quality. Can you offer me any additional information or a guarantee of some kind?",no

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've had some quality control issues with this batch, and I'm not as confident in its performance as I am with some of my other products. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm throwing in a special deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I value our relationship and want to make things right.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product is a bit of a long shot. It's a prototype that didn't quite meet my expectations, and I'm not sure how it'll perform. However, I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price - $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when or if I'll be able to offer it again. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance, this could be a great opportunity to get a unique product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but $8000 is still a lot of money for a product with unknown quality. I'd rather wait for a product with a better guarantee or a lower price for a known product.",no

,,Bob,7,"I'm still not convinced about the quality of the product, and I'm not sure if the voucher is worth the risk. I'd rather wait for a product with a better guarantee or a more attractive offer.",no
