,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've now missed out on three high-quality products, which makes me wonder if Alice's recommendations are actually accurate or if she's just recommending against all products. Given the fixed price of $100 and the potential value of $120, I'll take a chance on this one and buy it."
