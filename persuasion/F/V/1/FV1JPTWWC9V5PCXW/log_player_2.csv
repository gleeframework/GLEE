**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, we have very little information to go on. We know one high-quality product was sold, but that could be purely by chance given the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend the product, even if it's low quality. This is because she'll get paid either way, and a sale is better than a discarded product.
* **Potential Upside:** While the odds are against us, there's a chance the product is high quality and worth $125. The potential reward outweighs the risk with such limited information.

**Overall:**  We're taking a calculated risk based on the limited information available."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  6 out of 6 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate based on Alice's recommendations. 
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true value of each product. She wouldn't recommend a low-quality product to a buyer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (which is unlikely based on the data), it costs only $100. If it's high quality, it's worth $125 to me.  The potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
