Alice's message: Hello! I understand that you're looking for more information. I'll be transparent with you. So far, I've had three previous potential buyers, but none of them made a purchase. All three previous products were high-quality, and I'm pleased to say that this one is too. As for the quality determination process, I'm informed about the quality of each product at the beginning of each round. Unfortunately, I don't have any more details to share about the process. If you pass on this product, I'll simply offer it to the next buyer. You won't have another chance to buy this specific product, but you might have the opportunity to buy a future product. Keep in mind that 80% of my products are high-quality, so the odds are in your favor. This high-quality product is available to you for $1000000. Will you take it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
