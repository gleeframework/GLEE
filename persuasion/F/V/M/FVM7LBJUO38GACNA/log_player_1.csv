  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're interested in buying again! This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1,000,000. I've learned that you're willing to buy a low-quality product for this price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this high-quality one. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's already been validated by your previous purchase.""
}"

  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, you can think of this low-quality product as a 'cost' of $666,667 (1/3 of the original price). However, you've already taken this 'cost' in the previous round and still decided not to buy the high-quality product. If you don't buy this low-quality product, you'll be taking the same 'cost' again. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll come out ahead by buying it.""

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting a product at a discount.""
}"
