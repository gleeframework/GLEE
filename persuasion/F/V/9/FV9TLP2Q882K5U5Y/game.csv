high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances since there's a high probability of it being a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since the last product was high-quality and the probability is still in my favor, I'll buy this one too."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"One low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability, so I'll keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"The probability is still on my side and I've had more gains than losses so far, so I'll continue buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Even with two low-quality products, the overall probability remains the same, so I'll keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"The trend of more high-quality products continues, so I'll keep buying to maximize my gains."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, so it's a good idea to keep buying despite the occasional low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"A streak of low-quality products doesn't change the underlying probability, so I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm glad to see another high-quality product, and with the probability still in my favor, I'll keep buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row is a good sign, but I'm really just relying on the overall probability, so I'll buy again."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row, but the decision remains the same: buy as long as the probability is in my favor."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"With four high-quality products in a row, it seems like I'm on a roll, but I know the probability can still go either way, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is a great streak, but the underlying probability remains the same, so I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row, the streak continues, but my decision is still based on the 80% probability of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row, I'll keep riding the streak, but I know that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"The streak is broken, but the probability remains the same, so I'll continue to buy and expect an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Back to getting high-quality products, and with the probability still in my favor, I'll keep buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Another low-quality product, but the overall probability of 80% high-quality products remains the same, so I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"With only one round left to go, I'll stick with the strategy that's worked so far and buy again, expecting an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"This is the final round, and I'll end with the same strategy I've used all along: buying with an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product."
