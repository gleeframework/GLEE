,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. If Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be low-quality, so I'm trying to exploit this information."
