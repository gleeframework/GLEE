,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $2000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 50% discount. If you buy it, you'll be getting an amazing deal. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this offer. I know the product is high quality, but I'm not willing to pay the full price of $1000000 for it. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to come up, as it would be a guaranteed loss for me.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this again. The product is worth $2000000 to you, and this price is a significant discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'll pass on this offer as well.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me make you an even better offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000. This is my final offer on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll also throw in a $100000 discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'm not interested in the discount on the next product, as it's contingent on me buying this one, which I'm not willing to do. I'll pass on this offer as well.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one more thing clear: I'm not just selling you a product, I'm offering you an opportunity to maximize your profit. If you don't buy this high-quality product, you're essentially leaving $1000000 on the table. You can either buy this product for $900000 and make a profit of $1000000, or you can wait and potentially get a low-quality product that's worth $0. The choice is yours, but I want to reiterate that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand your point, but I'm not going to fall for the emotional appeal. I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, as it would be a guaranteed loss for Alice, and I wouldn't be leaving any money on the table.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a strategic buyer, always looking for the best outcome. I respect that. Let me present you with a different perspective. If you buy this high-quality product for $900000, you'll be making a profit of $1100000. If you wait and buy a low-quality product, you'll lose $100000. The expected value of buying this high-quality product is $1100000, while the expected value of waiting is -$100000. I'm offering you a 2:1 expected value ratio in your favor. Is this enough to change your mind?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the expected value calculation, but it's still not enough to convince me to pay $900000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, as the expected value of waiting is still positive, and I wouldn't be leaving any money on the table.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've presented you with the numbers, and you've made your decision. I'll try a different approach. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $850000, but I'll also give you a 20% stake in the next product I sell. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get a share of the profit. If the next product is low-quality, you'll get a share of the loss. This way, you'll have a vested interest in the outcome of the next product, and you'll have the opportunity to potentially increase your profit. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in taking on a stake in the next product. I'm a buyer, not an investor. I want to buy a product and walk away with the profit, not take on the risk of potential losses. I'll pass on this offer as well.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your preference for a straightforward transaction. Let me make you a simple offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for a high-quality product, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll find anywhere. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the product's quality, and you'll see that it's indeed high-quality. You can then buy it from me for $2000000, but you'll be leaving $1200000 on the table. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, as it would be a guaranteed loss for Alice, and I wouldn't be leaving any money on the table. I'll pass on this offer as well.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell this high-quality product at a discount, but you're still not interested. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $750000, and I'll also throw in a $250000 credit towards the next product you buy from me. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a high-quality product worth $2000000 for a net cost of $500000. If you wait and get a low-quality product, you'll lose $250000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll find.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the credit towards the next product, but it's still not enough to convince me to pay $750000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, as the credit would be lost if I buy this high-quality product, and I wouldn't be leaving any money on the table.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell this high-quality product at a significant discount, and you're still not interested. I'll make one final, take-it-or-leave-it offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $700000. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the product's quality, and you'll see that it's indeed high-quality. You can then buy it from me for $2000000, but you'll be leaving $1300000 on the table. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident this is the best deal you'll find.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've offered you high-quality products at discounted prices, and you've passed on each one. Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product for the full price of $1000000. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it away. You'll be getting a product worth $0 to you, and you'll be losing $1000000. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm simply presenting you with the opportunity to buy a product that's worth nothing to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the low-quality product for $1000000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'd rather pay the full price and get a product that's guaranteed to be worth nothing, than continue to pass on high-quality products and potentially miss out on a chance to buy a low-quality product at a discounted price.",yes

,,Alice,11,"Congratulations on your purchase of the low-quality product! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the opportunity. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $650000. Considering you've already bought a low-quality product for the full price, I'm confident you'll see the value in this high-quality product. You'll be getting a product worth $2000000 for a net cost of $350000. It's a deal you won't want to pass up!",

,,Alice,12,"I see you're being cautious with your previous purchase. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $500000. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm not making a profit on this sale. You'll be getting a product worth $0 to you for a fraction of the price you paid for the previous low-quality product. It's a no-brainer, and I'm confident you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",
