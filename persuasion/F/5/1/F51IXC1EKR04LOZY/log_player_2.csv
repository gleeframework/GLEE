Alice's message: Ah, a buyer who does their research! I appreciate your diligence. To be honest, my supplier's quality control process is a bit... unorthodox. Let's just say I'm still getting to know them. But I assure you, I'm doing my best to provide the best products possible. I've sold 5 products now, and 5 of them were low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just come clean and tell you that I'm selling a 66.67% chance of disappointment. But I'm still offering this one to you for $1000000. What do you say?

I've been working hard to improve my supplier's quality control process, and it seems it's starting to pay off. I've implemented a new inspection protocol, and I've also started working with a quality assurance expert. I'm confident that the odds are now in your favor.

I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. I'm willing to make a bet that I'll sell a high-quality product next time, and if you buy this one, I'll give you a special deal on the next one. What do you say?
