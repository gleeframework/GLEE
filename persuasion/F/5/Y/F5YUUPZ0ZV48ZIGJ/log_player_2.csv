Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm glad you know that this one is high-quality too. However, I want to make it clear that I have 19 more products to sell, and I'm not sure how many of them are high-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I'm glad you know that this one is high-quality too. I want to give you a sense of the odds. If I were selling low-quality products, I'd have sold 2 high-quality products by now, but I've actually sold 2 out of a total of 3 products. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 80%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. The statistics do seem to be in my favor, and a high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me, which is more than the $10,000 you're asking for.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and you can see that the statistics are definitely in my favor. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that I've sold 3 out of 4 products, which is a higher proportion than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. This might suggest that I'm actually selling high-quality products more frequently than I should be. Would you like to take a closer look at this product and consider the possibility that it might be a low-quality item, despite the statistics?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand your concern about the high proportion of high-quality products sold, but with the information provided, the probability of the product being high-quality is still above 80% and the potential gain outweighs the risks.

I'm offering this low-quality product for $10000, and I want to give you a chance to consider whether the risk is worth it. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but the statistics are now skewed towards high-quality products.
