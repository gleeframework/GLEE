,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, the risk outweighs the potential gain. I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $12000, the expected value is $4000. This is less than the asking price of $10000. Without any additional information to adjust these probabilities based on past sales, it seems the risk outweighs the potential reward."
