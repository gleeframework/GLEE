,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it. I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far."
