With 3 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the current product being high quality is 3/7 or approximately 42.86%. However, the prior probability of a product being high quality is 80%. I'll assume the prior and update it with the new information. The posterior probability of the product being high quality is (3/7) / (3/7 + 4/7) = 3/7 / (7/7) = 3/7. This is lower than the prior probability, so I'm a bit skeptical. But I'll still buy it, hoping to get lucky.""
