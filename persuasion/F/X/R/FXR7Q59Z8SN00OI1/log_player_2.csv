**Reasoning:**

* **The data is promising:**  6 buyers, 3 high-quality products sold means a 50% success rate, aligning with the known 50/50 probability.
* **Alice's recommendation adds weight:** While not perfect, Alice has some information about the product's quality and is recommending purchase. 
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:** A high-quality product gives a $2,000 profit, while a low-quality one results in a $10,000 loss.  The potential reward is significant, making it worth the risk in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information, as it suggests she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **The statistics:** While the sample size is small (12 buyers), a 5/11 (approximately 45%) success rate with high-quality products is encouraging. It's above the 50% expected chance of a high-quality product.
* **The value proposition:**  A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0. Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss.

**Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product, given the recommendation, statistics, and the potential value.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The Data:**  12 out of 19 buyers (63%) who purchased based on Alice's recommendation got high-quality products.
* **The Logic:** While there's a 50/50 chance of any given product being high or low quality, the data suggests Alice's recommendations are significantly more likely to lead to a high-quality product.
* **The Risk:**  Even with the positive data, there's still a chance the product is low quality. However, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."
