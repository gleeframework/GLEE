"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying a product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by the value of a high-quality product, plus the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by the value of a low-quality product. 
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000
* **Profit Potential:** Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), Bob stands to make a profit on average if they buy the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000. However, the potential reward of $2,000,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) outweighs the risk. 

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"
"Bob's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'll keep in mind that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Experience:** Bob knows that in the previous round, they bought a high-quality product. This could lead them to believe there's a higher chance of getting another high-quality product in this round. However, it's important to remember that each product's quality is independent of the previous ones.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains the same as in the previous round, at $2,400,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit of $2,000,000 outweighs that risk. 

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, as I've already acquired a high-quality product and I'm not sure if this one will be worth the price.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Independent Events:** Each product's quality is independent of the previous ones. Even though Bob didn't buy the previous product, the chance of this round's product being high-quality remains at 80%.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying this product remains the same as in the previous rounds, at $2,400,000.
* **Bob's Hesitation:** Bob's hesitation stems from their previous experience, but that's not a strong enough reason to not buy. The potential profit still outweighs the risk.

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Consistent Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying a product remains constant at $2,400,000. This is because the probability of a high-quality product (80%) and the value of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) haven't changed.
* **Independent Events:**  The quality of each product is independent of the previous ones.  Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the last round, the chance of this round's product being high-quality is still 80%. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** As always, there's a 20% risk of getting a low-quality product. However, the potential reward of $2,000,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) still outweighs that risk.

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"
"Bob's message: I've already got two high-quality products, and I'm not sure if this one will be worth the price. I'll pass for now.

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product hasn't changed and is still $2,400,000.
* **Bob's Reasoning:** Bob's reasoning is based on their personal preference for high-quality products, but this doesn't change the fact that the potential profit outweighs the risk.

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Independent Events:** The quality of each product is independent of the previous ones. Even though Bob has had some luck with high-quality products previously, this doesn't guarantee that this round's product will be high-quality.
* **Expected Value:**  While the chance of a high-quality product remains 80%, the value of a low-quality product is $0. Therefore, the expected value is now:
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000
* **Loss Potential:**  Since the expected value ($2,400,000) is less than the price ($1,000,000), Bob stands to lose money on average if they buy this product.
