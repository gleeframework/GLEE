low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure what you think it's worth. I'll be honest with you, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy it, you'll get it for $100, and you'll find out its quality afterwards. If you don't buy it, I'll keep trying to sell it to someone else, and you can wait for the next product.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product! I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I'm glad the first one was sold. Now, I'll give you some context: the first product sold was low-quality. This means that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 1/2. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm offering you a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a relatively low ratio of high-quality products sold. This product is worth $100, and you'll find out its quality afterwards. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, given the relatively low ratio of high-quality products sold.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer, and I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. This means the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is still 1/3. I want to let you know that the first product sold was low-quality, and now I'm offering the third product, which is also low-quality. I'm giving you a hint: if you buy this product, you'll be getting a product that's not as good as the one sold in the second round. The price is still $100, and you'll find out its quality afterwards. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your hint, Alice. I'd like to wait and see if you have any better offers in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've had two low-quality products in a row, which means the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is still 1/3. I want to be transparent with you: I've had a streak of bad luck, and I'm not sure what's going on. However, I'm still offering you a great deal on this product for $100. I'm willing to take a risk and sell it to you at the same price as the previous ones, hoping that you'll take a chance on me. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on you, Alice. I'll take the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer, and I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I've had three low-quality products in a row, which is a bit of a streak. I want to be upfront with you: at this point, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm still offering you this product for $100, and you'll find out its quality afterwards. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance on me.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance on you, Alice. I'm willing to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'll take the risk for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer, and I've sold 4 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I've had four low-quality products in a row, which is a significant streak. At this point, it's reasonable to wonder if the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm still offering you this product for $100. If you're willing to take a chance, you can buy it and find out its quality afterwards. Keep in mind that if you don't buy it, I'll keep trying to sell it to someone else, and you can wait for the next product.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I understand the streak of low-quality products, but I still think the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm hoping to break the streak and get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're the seventh buyer, and I've sold 5 products so far, with 2 being high-quality. The streak of low-quality products is broken! I'm glad you took a chance on me and bought the previous product. Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product, which is a great opportunity. Given the 2 high-quality products sold out of 5, the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 40%. I think this is a great deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're the eighth buyer, and I've sold 6 products so far, with 3 being high-quality. However, this product is low-quality, which means the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 3/6 or 50%. I want to be transparent with you: given the number of high-quality products sold, it's possible that the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. However, I'm still offering you this product for $100. If you're willing to take a chance, you can buy it and find out its quality afterwards.",

What do you think?",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given the updated statistics, I'm even more cautious.
