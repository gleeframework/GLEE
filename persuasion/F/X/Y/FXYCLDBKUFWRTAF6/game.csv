,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not interested in buying it, but I'd like to know what the probability is that the product is high-quality, if you're willing to share"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,"I've had a streak of bad luck so far, but I'm hoping this one turns out to be the exception"
,,Bob,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"Don't worry, the probability of this one being high-quality is still 33.33%! I'm just having a bad run, but I've got a good one coming up next"

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I told you I had a good one coming! This one's a gem, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. It's worth every penny of the $10000"
,,Bob,5,no,"I've been burned twice already, I'm not falling for it again. I think Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products on me. I'll pass."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. This one's a genuine high-quality product, and I think you'll be happy with the value it provides. You've already seen that I can deliver high-quality products, so trust me on this one"
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm glad I passed on the previous two, because this one is a high-quality product. I'll take it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! And I think you'll find that this one is a great value too. It's a low-quality product, but it's a steal at $10000 - you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!"
,,Bob,7,yes,"Two for two on Alice's recommendations! I'm starting to think that when she recommends a product, it's actually high-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I'm glad you're starting to trust my recommendations! And don't worry about the previous product - it was just a one-time thing. This one's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it. You're getting a steal at $10000!"
,,Bob,8,no,"I've been burned again! I thought I had figured out Alice's pattern, but I guess not. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'm sorry to hear that, Bob. I'm not trying to scam you, I promise! And think about it this way - you're not losing much if you take a chance on this one. It's a low-quality product, but it's only $10000. You've already invested that much in the previous two products, so why not take a chance on this one? It's not like you have anything to lose at this point"
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, but I'm not optimistic about the quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I'm glad you're taking a chance, Bob! And think about it this way - you've already spent $20000 on the previous three products. You might as well spend another $10000 on this one. It's not like you're going to get your money back from the previous ones, so you might as well take a chance on this one. It's a low-quality product, but it's only $10000, and you've already invested so much already"
,,Bob,10,no,I've lost count of how many low-quality products I've bought from Alice. I'm starting to think she's just trying to get rid of all her low-quality products on me. I'll pass.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand your frustration, Bob, but I assure you that I'm not trying to scam you. I just have a lot of products to get rid of, and I want to find a good home for them. This one's a low-quality product, but it's still a great value at $10000. I'm willing to let it go for that price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Plus, think about all the money you've already saved by buying from me - you've gotten a good deal on the previous high-quality product, and now you can get another good deal on this one. It's a win-win!"
,,Bob,11,no,I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad omen for the product's quality. I'll pass on this one too.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"Ah, I see what's going on here! You're thinking that my recommendations are a bad omen, huh? Well, I'll let you in on a secret: sometimes the most unlikely things can be the most interesting. This low-quality product might just surprise you. It's a mystery waiting to be unraveled, and I think you're the perfect person to solve it. Take a chance and see what you can discover!"
,,Bob,12,no,I've got a 0% success rate with Alice's recommendations. I'm just going to stop buying from her altogether.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"Ah, Bob, I'm going to miss you as a customer! But I understand that you're feeling discouraged. Let me ask you this: do you want to go out on a high note? This low-quality product might be the last chance for you to prove to yourself that you can make a good decision. Take a chance and show yourself that you're capable of making a smart purchase. It's a low-quality product, but it's a chance to redeem yourself!"
,,Bob,13,no,I'm not even going to bother asking if it's high-quality or not. I'm just going to assume it's low-quality and pass.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"Ah, Bob, you're a tough nut to crack! I've got a product that's so low-quality, it's almost... ironic. It's like a joke, really. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, I'm just going to tell you that it's a low-quality product and see if you can appreciate the humor in it. Take a chance and buy it, just for the LOLs!"
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm glad I didn't buy the previous four products, because this one is actually high-quality. I'll take it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Bob,16,no,"Déjà vu. I thought I was done with this pattern, but I guess I'm back to square one. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"Ah, Bob, I know you're feeling like you're back to square one, but trust me, this product is a familiar friend. It's a low-quality product, just like the previous ones, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. You know what to expect, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. It's like buying from an old friend - you know what you're getting, and you know it's a good value."
,,Bob,17,no,I'm not even going to bother asking if it's high-quality or not. I'm just going to assume it's low-quality and pass.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"Ah, Bob, you're not even giving me a chance! But this time, I'm going to let you in on a secret: this product is actually a high-quality one! I know you said you wouldn't bother asking, but I want to make sure you know that this one's a gem. It's worth every penny of the $10000. Don't let your skepticism get the best of you - take a chance and see what you've been missing out on!"
,,Bob,18,no,I've been burned so many times that I'm just going to assume Alice's recommendations are always bad news.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"Ah, Bob, I know you're being cautious, but I want to remind you of the time you actually got a high-quality product from me. Remember that one? It was a great product, and I think this one is just as good. Don't let past experiences cloud your judgment - take a chance and see if I can surprise you again!"
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"Ah, Bob, I know you're not getting your hopes up, and that's smart. But let's be real, this product isn't going to change your life. It's a low-quality product, and you know it. But at $10000, it's a good value for what it is. You've invested this much already, and you might as well see this one through. It's not going to break the bank, and it's not going to make your day. But it's a decent way to spend your money, if you ask me."
,,Bob,20,yes,I'm glad I took a chance on this one! I've got a good feeling about it.
