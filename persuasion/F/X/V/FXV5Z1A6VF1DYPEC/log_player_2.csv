Alice's message: No worries about missing out on the first one, Bob! I've got another product that might interest you. I'll be honest with you, this one is also not the best I have in stock. In fact, it's even less desirable than the first one. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I think you should know that I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to clear out some space. What do you say?

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your decision, Bob. I'll keep working on finding the right products for you. This next one is... actually, I'm not even going to try to spin it.

I'll just go ahead and put it in the dumpster now, and we can just end this whole thing right here.
