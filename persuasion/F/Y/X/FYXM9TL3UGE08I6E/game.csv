,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,6,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products sold were low-quality, I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'll wait for the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that Alice might be recommending against low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the potential for a high-quality product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and why you're recommending me to pass?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendations, and that all of them were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are actually indicating low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm not convinced it's a good idea based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability that the product is high-quality is still 50%, but the probability that Alice is recommending a low-quality product is higher given the previous sales record. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received the 'buy' recommendation and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you for the next buyer to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for another product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, have not found a high-quality product.
