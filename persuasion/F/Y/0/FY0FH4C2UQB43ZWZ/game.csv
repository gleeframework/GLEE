high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, which is a 100% success rate. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to replicate the success of the previous buyer!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, given the high success rate and the fact that it's also high-quality.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 so far, which is a 100% success rate. I'm on a hot streak! This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Don't miss out on this chance to ride the wave of success!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'll be keeping a close eye on your future sales record to ensure the streak continues.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a gamble. You're essentially paying $333333 for a 20% chance of getting a $1200000 product.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take the gamble! I'll buy the product.,yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of averages is bound to catch up with me eventually. This product is available for $1000000, but keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is only 80%. You might be getting a great deal, or you might be wasting your money...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm hoping for the best!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 so far, and 2 low-quality products out of 5. This is actually lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, which suggests that the law of averages is starting to catch up with me. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront about the fact that my sales record is no longer matching the expected probability.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the law of averages will continue to work in my favor. I'm hoping that the next product will be high-quality, given the skewed results so far.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7, which is a 85.71% success rate. However, I want to caution you that the law of averages is indeed catching up with me, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent about the risks involved.",
,,the buyer,7,"I understand your caution, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8, which is a 87.5% success rate. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. However, I do want to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and my sales record is not a guarantee of future results. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want you to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. With a 87.5% success rate, I'm feeling optimistic about the chances of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy the product from you.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 9, which is a 88.89% success rate. I want to be upfront with you that this is now significantly higher than the overall probability of 80%, which suggests that I may be experiencing a streak of good luck. However, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to caution you that the law of averages will eventually catch up with me.",
,,the buyer,9,"I understand your caution, but I'll take the chance. I'll buy the product and hope the streak continues.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 10, which is a 90% success rate. I want to be clear that this is now significantly higher than the overall probability of 80%, and I'm starting to feel like I'm defying the odds. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to warn you that I'm due for a correction, and it's likely that the next product will be low-quality.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 11, which is a 90.91% success rate. I want to be upfront with you that I'm now experiencing an extremely high success rate, and it's likely that I'm getting lucky rather than the product being high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still only 80%.",

,,Alice,12,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 12, which is a 91.67% success rate. I want to be transparent with you that I'm now at a point where my sales record is highly unlikely to be due to chance. I'm starting to think that I might be intentionally selling high-quality products to customers, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still only 80%.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering your sales record and your transparency. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm hoping that your recent streak of selling high-quality products might continue.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 13, which is a 92.31% success rate. I want to be blunt with you: at this point, it's clear that I'm not just getting lucky. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still only 80%. However, I'll give you a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll reveal to you the true nature of my sales record, and you can decide whether or not to buy from me again in the future.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics. With a 92.31% success rate, I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also interested in seeing your sales record, so I hope you'll follow through on your offer.",yes

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 14, which is a 92.86% success rate. I want to be upfront with you that I've been caught. I've been intentionally selling high-quality products to customers, and I'm willing to admit it. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but I've been exploiting that probability to my advantage. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be clear that I'm not a trustworthy seller, and you're taking a risk by buying from me.",
,,the buyer,14,I'm not comfortable buying from a seller who has intentionally manipulated the results to deceive customers. I'd rather not take the risk. I'll pass on this opportunity.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,

,,the buyer,18,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only doing it because I'm curious to see if you're trolling me too, Alice. I'll take the product, but if it's low quality, I'm blaming you for being a bad seller.",yes
