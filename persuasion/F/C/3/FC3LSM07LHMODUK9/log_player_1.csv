  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about the previous product. This one is different. I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great value. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $12500 to me and a 50% chance of being worth $0. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from you to make a more informed decision.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

However, I'd like to offer you a recommendation: if you're willing to buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that you'll get a refund of $2500 if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll only pay $7500, and you'll be guaranteed to get at least that much value out of it, regardless of its quality. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm convinced by the guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'll get $0, and if it's high-quality, I'll get $12500. The guarantee only changes the worst-case scenario, but it doesn't change the expected value. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.

This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product, and if not, you'll have a second chance to buy another product at the same price. Would you like to take the lottery ticket?""

This way, you'll know for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product, but only if I get to know its quality afterwards. If it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000, but if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the certification offer.

I'm willing to let you have it for $5000, which is a significant discount from the regular price. This way, you'll be able to get a low-quality product at a low price, and you can still take advantage of the $500 credit I offered earlier. Would you like to take it?""

Would you like to take the discounted price and the added chance of getting a high-quality product?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure I understand the 10% chance of getting a high-quality product. If I buy the product, I'll either get a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50% regardless of the discount.
