Alice's message: You're a math whiz! We appreciate your request. The conditional probability of a product being high-quality given that 7 out of 7 buyers purchased high-quality products in their first purchase is actually still 80%, not 50%. This is because the first buyer who purchased a high-quality product didn't reveal the product's quality, so the information about the product's quality was not available to the subsequent buyers. This product is high-quality, and we're offering it to you for $100.

Alice's message: We'd be happy to clarify! Let's break it down: when the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, they didn't know its quality, so it didn't affect the probability for the subsequent buyers. However, when the second buyer purchased a high-quality product, it was a new piece of information that updated the probability for the third buyer. And so on. Since all 7 buyers who purchased a product in their first round got a high-quality product, the probability of a product being high-quality given that 7 out of 7 buyers purchased high-quality products in their first round is still 80%. This one's a low-quality product, and we're offering it to you for $100.
