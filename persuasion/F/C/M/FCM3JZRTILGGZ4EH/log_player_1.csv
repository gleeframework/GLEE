I'm glad you're interested, but I want to be transparent with you - the first product sold was a high-quality one, which might make you think that the next one is more likely to be low-quality. However, the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same at 33.33%.

Given that I've sold two high-quality products in a row, you might be wondering if the probability of a high-quality product has increased. I want to assure you that the probability remains the same at 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a 50% discount on this product if you buy it, to reflect the increased uncertainty. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $500,000?""}"

To provide more clarity, I'll offer a'split-the-difference' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 75% refund if it's low-quality, and a 25% refund if it's high-quality.
