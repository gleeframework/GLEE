,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 2 out of 2 products were not recommended, I'm inclined to think that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice has recommended not to buy.
