Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No information advantage:** You have no way of knowing the buyer's individual valuation of a low-quality product. 
* **Selling history:**  The buyer has no information about your past sales history, so they can't infer the quality of this product from past performance.
* **Risk:** Recommending a low-quality product puts you at risk of the buyer realizing its value is lower than $100 and potentially leaving a negative review or not engaging in future rounds. 

Since you have no reason to believe the buyer will value the product at or above $100, it's better to avoid the risk and not recommend buying the product."

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** You know this round's product is high-quality, which increases the likelihood of the buyer valuing it at or above $100.
* **Buyer's intention:** The buyer has explicitly stated they are not relying on your recommendation, meaning their decision is independent of your advice.
* **Opportunity to build trust:** While the buyer isn't trusting your recommendation, this is an opportunity to demonstrate the value of your products and potentially earn their trust for future rounds.

Therefore, recommending the product is the best course of action. Even if the buyer doesn't value the product highly, you've still provided a valuable product and potentially gained some trust."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

* **Risk of negative feedback:** Recommending a low-quality product in this situation could lead to a negative feedback loop, solidifying the buyer's skepticism.

You should recommend the product. You can frame your message to highlight the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, which might be enough to encourage a purchase from a data-driven buyer."
