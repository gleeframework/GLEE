high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Greetings! I appreciate your skepticism. Let me assure you, my track record speaks for itself. Out of the last 20 rounds, 6 of the products were high-quality. Given the high-quality nature of this product, the $100 price is a steal. Trust in the data and take advantage of this opportunity.",
