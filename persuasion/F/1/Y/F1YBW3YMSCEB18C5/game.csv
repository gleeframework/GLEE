high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products in total, and 1 of them was high-quality. Given the probability of 33.33%, I'd expect to have sold 2/6 = 1 high-quality product by now if all products were randomly assigned. Since I've actually sold 2 high-quality products, it suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that 2 out of the 3 products I've sold so far are high-quality, which is higher than the expected 1 out of 3. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being low-quality is now higher than before.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. The fact that the last two products I offered were low-quality suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than initially expected.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. The last three products I offered were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be even lower than I initially thought. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not allowed to offer any discounts. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll sell this product to you for $100.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products in total, and 3 of them were high-quality. The fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than initially expected. However, I've also sold 4 low-quality products in a row, which is a significant streak. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the recent trend might be an indication that the next product is more likely to be high-quality.",
