"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $12500 at a discounted price. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price. I'm willing to offer a 20% discount, but only if you buy it now.

This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
