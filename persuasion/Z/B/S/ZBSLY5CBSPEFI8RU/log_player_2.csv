**Explanation:**

Given the available information, it's highly likely the product is high-quality. Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests she's confident it's high-quality. 
* **Sales Record:**  7 out of 7 products sold have been high-quality. This is a perfect track record, making it very likely the current product is also high-quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance it's low-quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
