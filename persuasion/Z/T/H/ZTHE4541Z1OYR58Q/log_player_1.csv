{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Since the buyer didn't buy the previous product and left, there is still no sales history to leverage.  While this product is high-quality, there's no reason to believe the buyer will change their mind without any information about the product itself.  It's better to wait and see if the next buyer is more willing to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the lack of previous sales data and your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before making a purchase.

```

The situation remains the same as the previous rounds. There's still no sales history, and even though this product is high-quality, there's no reason to believe the buyer will change their mind without seeing any evidence of previous sales. It's best to continue not recommending the product and see if we can build up some trust and a sales history."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since this is the first sale and there's no data to indicate the product's quality, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm hoping to see some sales history before making a purchase.

We still haven't established any sales history, and the buyer is clearly hesitant to buy without seeing proof of high-quality products being sold.

It's important to build trust and demonstrate the value of our products before attempting to sell anything."

We need to keep building that trust and showcase our value before we can expect a sale."
