**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since only one product has been sold so far, and it was high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is also very high (80% chance). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality. She is likely to recommend products she believes are good.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the worst outcome is that you lose $100. However, there is a strong chance of gaining $20 ($120 value - $100 cost).

**Therefore, it is highly likely that the current product is high quality, making it a good gamble.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products recommended by Alice have been high-quality so far. This suggests she has a strong ability to identify good products.
* **Potential Value:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

While there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product, the current data strongly suggests a high chance of a good deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which carries weight.
* **Past data:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products so far.  While the sample size is small, it strongly suggests a positive trend.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential loss is only $100. However, if it's high quality, the gain is $20. 

Considering these factors, it's a reasonable bet to buy the product."
