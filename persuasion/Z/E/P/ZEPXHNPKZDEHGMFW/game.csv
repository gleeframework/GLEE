,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering our product! With a 50% chance of being high-quality, this product has the potential to bring immense value to your life. As a token of our confidence, we're offering it to you for $1000000. We're willing to take the risk alongside you, and we believe that the potential reward is well worth the investment. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about the seller's past behavior, I will pass on this offer. The price of $1000000 is too high given the 50% chance of the product being low-quality, which would be worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! We understand that our previous offer may have been a bit steep, and we're willing to adjust our approach. With the same 50% chance of being high-quality, we're offering this product to you for $500000. We believe that the potential upside is still significant, and we're willing to take the risk alongside you. What do you think? Is $500000 a price you're willing to pay for a chance at a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the chance. Since the price is $500000 and there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, the expected value is $625000 (0.5 * $1250000 + 0.5 * $0). This is greater than the price you're offering, so it seems like a reasonable risk to take.",yes
