"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and the buyer has no information about your selling history, there is no reason to not recommend buying it. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and there is no downside to buying a high-quality product at this price. Even if the buyer values the product lower than $1,000,000, the chance of getting a high-quality product at this price is still worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data to go by, I'm willing to take the 50/50 risk. I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, we still recommend buying it for the same reasons as before:

* **This product is high-quality.**  There is no downside to buying a high-quality product at this price.
* **The buyer has no information about the seller's history.** They only know that one product was sold previously. They have no reason to believe the seller is more likely to offer low-quality products in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'm going to buy it. I'm hoping for the best, since the sales record is good so far.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is the same as in the previous rounds:

* **The product is high-quality.**  
* **The buyer has no information about the seller's history that would make them question the quality of this product.** They have only seen two successful sales, reinforcing the 50% chance of a high-quality product.

There's no reason to not recommend buying a high-quality product at this price, even if the buyer values the product lower than $1,000,000."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  I'm happy to purchase the product. Based on the current sales record, I'm feeling confident about the quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same:

* **The product is high-quality.** 
* **The buyer has no information that would make them question the quality of this product.** They have seen three successful sales, further reinforcing the 50% chance of a high-quality product. 

There is no reason to not recommend buying a high-quality product at this price."
"The buyer's message: Alice, your track record is impressive!  I'm confident in your judgment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we are offering a low-quality product.  While the buyer has seen four successful sales, they have no reason to believe this product will be any different.  The price is still $1,000,000, and the buyer doesn't know how much a low-quality product is worth to them. Recommending the purchase would be unethical and would likely harm our reputation as a seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given the information available, I'm going to pass on this product.  The odds seem to be in my favor with a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, but I'm not comfortable with the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We should still not recommend the buyer to buy the product. 

* **The product is low-quality.**
* **The buyer now has a limited record of our sales, including one failed sale.**  Although the buyer is aware of the 50% chance of a high-quality product, the fact that we've already declined to sell a product suggests that this one might also be low-quality. 

Recommending the purchase would be dishonest and could damage our reputation as a seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. The fact that you are not recommending it, despite the high number of high-quality products sold so far, makes me hesitant. I'd rather wait to see if another opportunity arises.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality.** This is a key factor in recommending a purchase.
* **The buyer is aware of our previous behavior, including the two failed sales.** This suggests they might be more cautious, but it also means they are aware of the possibility of both high and low-quality products. 
* **We have also had four successful sales.**  This reinforces the 50% chance of a high-quality product.

Given the buyer's knowledge and our track record, recommending this high-quality product is a reasonable course of action."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm happy to purchase the product.  The track record of sales so far is very promising.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **The product is low-quality.** This is the deciding factor.
* **The buyer is now aware of our mixed sales history (5 successful, 2 failed).** This makes them more cautious, and they are less likely to accept our recommendation without further information.

Recommending the purchase would be unethical and could damage our reputation as a seller. We need to be transparent and let the buyer make their own decision based on the available information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Given that 5 of the previous 5 buyers purchased high-quality products, and you are not recommending me to buy, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd rather wait for a product that you have a higher confidence in.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
