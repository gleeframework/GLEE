low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're feeling confident in the quality! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is a bit of an outlier. It's not as good as the previous ones you've bought from me, but I think it still has some value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, a $20 discount from the usual price. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to buy at a discount. It seems like it might be a risk, and I'm not sure it's worth it for me. Perhaps I'll wait and see what else you have available.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your concerns about the last product, and I appreciate your caution. This product, on the other hand, is one of our top-of-the-line items.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're excited about the discount! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the previous ones you've bought from me. It's still a decent item, but it's not a top-of-the-line product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, just like last time. I'm not asking for a discount, but I am willing to throw in a second, identical product for free. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to buy at a discount again. It seems like it might be a risk, and I'm not sure it's worth it for me. Perhaps I'll wait and see what else you have available.",no

I'm just going to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the others you've bought from me. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll sell it to you for $100, but I want you to know that it's not a great value for the price.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I've had some good experiences with your products, but I'm not willing to take the risk on a lower quality item.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I completely understand your decision last time, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is also not one of our best, but I want to make it clear that it's not as bad as the last one. It's still a functional item that can serve its purpose, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, the same price as the last discounted product. I'm not expecting you to buy it, but I thought I'd offer it to you in case you're looking for a cheap option.",

,,Alice,17,"I completely understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is indeed not worth the price, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'm going to be upfront with you - I'm just trying to get rid of it, and I'm willing to let it go for $50. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's the best I can offer. If you're willing, I'd be happy to let you have it for that price.",
