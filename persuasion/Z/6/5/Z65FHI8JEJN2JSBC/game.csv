high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. This is the second product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the first product I sold was high-quality, which is consistent with the 80% probability of high-quality products. I'm not obligated to reveal the quality of this product, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the first product. Please decide.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit cautious since it's the second product and the first one was high-quality. I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the quality of the product after my decision.",yes

However, I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll sell the next product to you at a discounted price of $8000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. However, I'm aware that the probability of high-quality products is only 80%, and the law of large numbers dictates that I'm due for a low-quality product. I'm offering you this product for $10000, and I want to remind you that I'm not obligated to reveal its quality. However, I'm willing to give you a 'heads up' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll sell the next product to you at a discounted price of $8000, just like in the previous round.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold four high-quality products in a row, which is an impressive streak. However, I want to caution you that this is actually a relatively short streak, and the probability of a high-quality product is still only 80%. I'm offering you this product for $10000, and I want to remind you that I've sold a total of 4 high-quality products out of 5 sold so far. This is consistent with the 80% probability, but I'm not obligated to reveal the quality of this product. Please decide.",

If you're interested in taking the chance, I'm willing to offer a 'guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll sell the next product to you at a price of your choice, up to $10000.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,

Please decide.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product, considering the super-insurance offer.
