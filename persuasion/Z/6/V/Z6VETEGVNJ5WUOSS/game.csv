,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare and valuable item. I'm willing to let it go for a mere $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. The quality is guaranteed, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",

This one is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative deal. I'm only offering it to you for $1000000. It's a risk-free investment, if you will.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales record yet. With only one product sold, it's still early days, and I'm not willing to take the risk without more data. I'd like to wait and see how your sales record unfolds before making a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I must correct my previous message - the product I offered earlier was not as described. Unfortunately, this one is also not what it seems. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far, which is a 33.33% success rate. I'm willing to be transparent with you - this product is not high-quality. But I'm willing to offer it to you for the full $1000000, and I'll even throw in a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. It's a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a premium price.",

I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in an additional $50000 on top. That way, you'll essentially get a $50000 bonus for taking a risk on a potentially low-quality product. The price remains at $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution, and I want to provide more context. Out of 4 products sold, only 1 was high-quality. This means that 3 out of 4 products were not what they seemed. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this next product: I'll give you a chance to buy it for $950000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in an additional $20000 on top.
