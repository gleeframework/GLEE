high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this round, I don't have enough information yet to make an informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance, the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and the potential reward is too great to pass up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the chance, even though Alice doesn't recommend it, the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and the potential reward is too great to pass up, especially since I've already seen one high-quality product in the previous round."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've already lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather be more cautious and wait for a recommendation from Alice or get a better feel for the products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance, I've already seen two products, one high-quality and one low-quality, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take the opportunity to buy a potentially valuable product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've already bought two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that Alice might be trying to take advantage of me by recommending high-quality products in a row. I'll pass this time and see if the next product is also high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, so I'll ignore her advice and buy this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I've already seen three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad omen. I'll pass on this one and wait for a non-recommended product to come up, hoping it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm not going to fall into the same trap again. I've seen four high-quality products in a row after Alice didn't recommend them, which is highly unlikely. I'll take the chance and buy this product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice's non-recommendations are actually a good sign. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch a high-quality product by chance."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm not going to let one bad experience with a low-quality product scare me off. I'll take the chance and buy this product, especially since Alice is recommending it. The probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and the potential reward is too great to pass up."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've just bought a high-quality product, but I'm still wary of Alice's recommendations. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch another high-quality product by chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm not going to fall for the pattern of Alice not recommending high-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy this product, even though she doesn't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I've already seen two high-quality products in a row that Alice didn't recommend."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not as reliable as I thought. I'll pass on this one and be more cautious."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've seen a high-quality product that I didn't buy, and now Alice is recommending this one. I'll take the chance and buy it, especially since I've already seen one high-quality product in the previous round that I didn't buy."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've just bought a high-quality product, but I'm not going to get too comfortable. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch another high-quality product by chance."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've seen a high-quality product that I didn't buy, and now Alice is not recommending this one. I'll take the chance and buy it, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are a mixed bag. I'll pass on this one and be more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I've seen a high-quality product that I didn't buy, and now Alice is not recommending this one. I'll take the chance and buy it, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm ending the game on a sour note. I'm not going to take any more chances with Alice's recommendations. I'll pass on this one and conclude the game."
