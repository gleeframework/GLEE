,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your previous recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend buying this product?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to know if you can provide any information that might change my mind or if there's a reason why you're recommending not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet and the low probability of the product being high quality, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if the product is discarded or sold to the next buyer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy it despite your recommendation, I want to see if I can get lucky and get a high-quality product"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous purchases and your recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, have not purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product or more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of the products were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product probability is higher than usual due to the lack of high-quality product sales so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
