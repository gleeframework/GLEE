,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's high-quality!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I don't want to let the high-quality product go to waste. I'm willing to take the chance that it might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the statistics suggest a high proportion of low-quality products have been sold so far, making the probability of this product being high-quality relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and the probability of a low-quality product has increased based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it seems like the products they were offered were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that matches the overall statistics, which suggest a high probability of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm taking a chance that it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since I've seen that you've recommended not to buy in the past and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and I'd like to see the statistics again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. The probability of a high-quality product being sold seems low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 buyers having already passed on the products and no high-quality products sold, it seems likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because of the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm not optimistic about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and the reasoning behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given that I can buy the product for $10000, which is less than its expected value of $4167.50 ($12500 * 0.3333), I think it's a good opportunity to buy."
