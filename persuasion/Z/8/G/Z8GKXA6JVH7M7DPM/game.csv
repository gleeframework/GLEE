,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of previous buyers and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all the products recommended by Alice so far have been low quality, which suggests that her recommendations may not be reliable.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm trying to take advantage of the information that Alice has seen 3 previous buyers pass on the product. If it were a low-quality product, they would have likely recommended it to me, and since they didn't, I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
