Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the details. The first high-quality product was sold to a buyer who only bought that one product, and the other two high-quality products were sold to different buyers, each of whom bought only one product. This suggests that the high-quality products were not sold to repeat customers, which is consistent with the assumption that the quality of the products is independent. Given this information, I'm offering this new product for $100. I'm willing to take on the risk that you might be the next buyer who only buys one product, but I think the odds are in my favor.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

However, I'd like to point out that the streak of high-quality products might be due to chance, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering this new product for $100. I'll give you a'streak-buster' deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll offer you the next product for $90. Would you like to take the deal?
