Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested, but I want to let you know that the product you purchased in the previous round was actually not what I expected. I'm not sure what happened, but it seems like we got a dud. This new product is a different one, and I'm hoping it will be more to your liking. It's still the same price of $10000, and I'm willing to take on the risk of it not being what you want. Are you still interested?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your explanation, and I'm not willing to take another risk on a product without knowing its quality. I'd like to wait for the next round.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad the guarantee helped alleviate your concerns! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already given you a guarantee on the last product, and it turned out to be low-quality. I'm starting to think that maybe there's an issue with the batch or something. I'm willing to offer you an even better guarantee: if you buy this product and it's also low-quality, I'll give you not only a full refund, but also an additional $5000. Is that enough to make you feel confident in your purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to improve the guarantee, but I'm still hesitant to take the risk. I've already lost $10,000 on the previous two products, and I'm not willing to risk another $10,000 on a product with a high chance of being low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next round.""}"

I'll give you a chance to buy this product at the discounted price of $5000, but with a twist. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a chance to 'roll over' the $5000 to the next round, and you can try to buy a different product at the original price of $10000.
