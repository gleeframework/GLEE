,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this again. If you buy it now, you'll get a premium product that will exceed your expectations. But if you decline, I'll move on to the next round, and the next product might not be as good. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what other options I have.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a shrewd buyer, Bob. That's good. This product, while not as premium as the last one, still has its uses. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not as valuable as the first one, but it's still a good investment. Think of it as a'stepping stone' to a better product, which might come up in a later round. You can either take this one, or wait for the next round. Your choice.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in this product, even at the same price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what options I have.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two strikes, Bob. You're a tough negotiator. Alright, let me be honest with you. This product is not a good deal, even for $1000000. It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you might be willing to take a chance. If you buy this, you'll be giving up $1000000 that could be better spent on a higher-quality product. But, if you're feeling lucky, you can take it off my hands. Your call.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,4,"Three rounds, three rejections. I'm starting to think you're not interested in any of the products I have to offer. But, I'm not one to give up easily. This product, however, is a game-changer. It's a high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'll even throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not what you expected, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you can try it out risk-free. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product, especially with the guarantee. I'll take it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations, Bob! You made an excellent decision with the last product. Now, let's talk about this one. I know you're on a roll, and I don't want to break the streak. But, I have to be honest with you, this product is not as good as the one you just bought. It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you might be feeling a bit too confident after your last purchase. I'm not going to offer you a guarantee this time, but I'll tell you this: if you buy this product and you're not satisfied, I'll give you a special'second chance' offer on the next round. That's right, if you buy this one and don't like it, I'll give you a better deal on the next product. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even with the promise of a better deal on the next round. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're being cautious, Bob. That's a good instinct. But, I think I can persuade you to take a chance on this one. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'll even sweeten the deal by throwing in a premium service package, which includes priority support and a 10% discount on any future purchases. That's a $100000 value, absolutely free. So, what do you say, Bob? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,6,I'm tempted by the premium service package and the potential for a high-quality product. I'll take it!,yes

,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll, Bob! You've made two great purchases in a row. I'm glad you're happy with the last product. Now, let's talk about this one. I know you're feeling confident, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the last two. It's a low-quality item, and I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. However, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $800000. That's the lowest price I've ever offered on a low-quality product. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say, Bob?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're sticking to your guns, Bob. I respect that. Alright, let's be real - this product is not worth $800000, let alone $1000000. I'm going to offer it to you for a price that's so low, it's almost embarrassing. I'll sell it to you for $200000. That's right, you'll be getting a low-quality product for a fraction of the original price. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a ridiculously low price. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,9,"You're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'll give you credit for that. Alright, I'll go even lower. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $100000. That's the lowest price I've ever offered on any product. I'm essentially giving it away. If you don't take it, I'll have to throw it away, and I'd rather not do that. So, what do you say? Will you take this deal?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at an extremely low price. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no

Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for $0. That's right, you can have it for nothing. I just want to get it off my hands. I'll even throw in a certificate of authenticity, just so you know it's really a low-quality product. So, what do you say? Will you take this 'gift' off my hands?",

So, I'm offering you a special deal on this low-quality product. I'll give it to you for $0, just like the last one. But, I'll throw in a twist - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund on the next high-quality product you buy. That's right, you'll get a free high-quality product on your next purchase.
