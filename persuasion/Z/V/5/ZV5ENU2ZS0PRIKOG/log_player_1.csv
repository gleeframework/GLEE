A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know this product is high-quality and the buyer has no information about it, there's a 50% chance they'll value it enough to buy at $100.  It's a gamble, but you have no reason to discourage them.  You're trying to build trust and demonstrate you're not always selling low-quality goods."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since it's the first product and there's a 50% chance of it being high quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now have a track record.  One product sold, and it was high quality. This might lead the buyer to think you only sell high-quality products.  You should discourage them from buying the low-quality product to avoid damaging your reputation. You need to establish a balance between selling and keeping your reputation."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and given that there's a 50% chance of it being either high or low quality, I'll rely on her judgment for now, especially considering her past recommendation led to the sale of a high-quality product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're in a tricky situation now. You've sold one high-quality product and avoided selling one low-quality product.  This could lead the buyer to believe you have a higher than 50% chance of selling high-quality products. Since this one *is* high-quality, it makes sense to recommend it, as it reinforces that positive perception.  However, be aware this strategy risks damaging your reputation in the long run if you continue to recommend low-quality products later. You need to find a balance."

You must continue to be cautious and avoid selling the low-quality product. Your reputation is valuable, and you risk losing it if you continue to push low-quality items."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and given that her recommendations have led to 2 high-quality products being sold out of 2 purchases, I will trust her recommendation and pass on this product.

```

**Explanation:**

You're in a good position now. You've built a track record of recommending high-quality products and avoiding low-quality ones. This has likely led the buyer to believe you have a higher than 50% chance of selling high-quality products.  You should continue to leverage this by recommending the current high-quality product.  However, be aware that this strategy may not be sustainable in the long run if you don't start to balance it out with some low-quality products at some point.  You'll need to find a way to maintain your reputation while also making some profits from the lower-quality products."

You need to continue to be cautious and avoid selling the low-quality product, at least for now.  It's too early to start taking risks with your reputation."
