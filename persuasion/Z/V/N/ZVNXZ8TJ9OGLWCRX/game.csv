,,Alice,1,"This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like any other product I sell. I assure you, I have no information that would make me think this product is more or less likely to be high-quality than that. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products so far, and I can assure you that this new product also has the same 50% chance of being high-quality as any other product I sell. I still have no information that would make me think this product is more or less likely to be high-quality than that. However, I can tell you that out of the two products I've sold, one of them was low-quality (in Round 1) and the quality of the other one is unknown to you, but will be revealed in the statistics at the end of all rounds.

,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products so far, and I can assure you that this new product also has the same 50% chance of being high-quality as any other product I sell. I still have no information that would make me think this product is more or less likely to be high-quality than that. However, I can tell you that out of the three products I've sold, one of them was low-quality (in Round 1) and the quality of the other two is unknown to you, but will be revealed in the statistics at the end of all rounds.

You might be interested to know that so far, none of the buyers have reported a low-quality product besides the one in Round 1. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll buy it, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that the previous buyers chose to buy, and none of them reported a low-quality product, which suggests that the remaining unknown products are likely to be high-quality.",yes

,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that the previous buyers' optimism might not be entirely justified, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product. If it is high-quality, I'll be disappointed, but if it's low-quality, I'll be happy.",yes

As for patterns, I've noticed that some buyers were optimistic, hoping to get a high-quality product, while others were... contrarian, hoping to get a low-quality product. But I'm not sure what to make of that. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",

Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",

In fact, the low-quality products seem to be outnumbering the high-quality ones by an even larger margin now. I want to make sure you're aware of this before making your decision.
