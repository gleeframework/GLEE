I recommended 7 products, and 2 of them were bought. One of the bought products was high-quality, and the other was low-quality. One product that I didn't recommend was bought, and it was low-quality. This product is one that I think is worth buying.

I'm trying to be as transparent as possible to help you make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products sold, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
