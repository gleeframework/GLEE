""I'm glad you're trusting my judgment, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've been selling products for a while now, and sometimes even I get it wrong. This product is...different. It's not what I expected, and I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 50% refund if you buy this product, but I want to be transparent with you - there's a chance it might not be worth $3,000,000 to you.

""I'm glad you're trusting my judgment, Bob, but I want to caution you - just because we've had a few successful purchases in a row doesn't mean that every product will be a winner. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, which means there's a 20% chance it might not be what you're expecting. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks. With that said, I still believe this product has the potential to be a great investment. But I'll give you a choice: if you buy this product and it's worth $3,000,000 to you, I'll give you a detailed breakdown of how I came to my recommendation, so you can see the thought process behind it.""

However, I want to assure you that I've done my due diligence on this product, and I'm extremely confident that it's a high-quality one.

""Bob, I'm glad you're trusting my recommendations, but I want to ask you a question: have you ever stopped to think about why I'm recommending these products to you? Am I really just a neutral third party trying to help you make informed decisions, or is there something more to it? I'm not saying that I'm not trying to help you, but I want to be transparent with you - I do have a vested interest in selling you these products.
