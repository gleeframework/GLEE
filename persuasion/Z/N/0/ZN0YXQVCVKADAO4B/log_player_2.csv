  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the first product was low quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high quality is still 33.33%. However, given the recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice may be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see how the next product turns out.""
