Since the first product was low-quality, it's likely that I'm trying to get rid of the low-quality ones quickly. This product, on the other hand, is high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to negotiate. If you're interested, I can offer you a 'discount' of $5000 off the price, but you'll have to take it as is.
