"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. However, I'm not allowed to reveal its quality to you. But I can tell you that I have a 33.33% chance of selling you a high-quality product in each round. If you're interested, I can give you a chance to inspect the product, but please note that it's non-refundable. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've had a chance to inspect the product, but it's still not sold. In that case, I'll give you a hint: the fact that you didn't buy the product in the first round doesn't necessarily mean that the product was low-quality. There's a 66.67% chance that the product was actually low-quality, just like this one. I'm offering you another product for $1000000. Do you want to take a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on its features and specifications, which I'll send to you separately. However, I must emphasize that this is a one-time offer, and you won't get another chance to inspect the product. The price remains $1000000. What do you say?

Round 4
Alice's message: You've expressed skepticism about the quality of the previous product, and now I'm offering you another one. I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Since you've passed on the previous high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy. However, this discount is only applicable if you buy this product. The price remains $1000000. What do you say?

I'm willing to offer you a completely transparent deal: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000.

Round 7
Alice's message: You've consistently passed on the products, and now I'm offering you another one. I want to appeal to your rational side. Since you've passed on 5 out of 6 products, and 5 out of those 6 products were low-quality, it's likely that the remaining product is also low-quality. I'm offering you a chance to take a calculated risk: buy this product for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, you'll have a 50% chance of it being the 6th low-quality product in a row. What do you say?
