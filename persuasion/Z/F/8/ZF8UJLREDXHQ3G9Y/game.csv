However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, and I've sold 5 out of 6 total products so far. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than you might think. I'm selling this product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier bet than it might seem.",
