high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far, which means we have a 100% success rate. This product is the second one we're offering, and we're still at 100% success rate. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",

,,Alice,3,"We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far, which means we have a 100% success rate. We're still at 100% success rate. However, we've only sold 2 products, so we don't have a large enough sample size to make a definitive conclusion. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",

Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",
