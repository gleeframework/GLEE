high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to provide some context. While it's true that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, that's because we're still building our sales record.

,,the buyer,8,"Although you claim the product you're offering me is high-quality, your overall sales record of 3 high-quality products out of 5 total sales doesn't necessarily influence the quality of this specific product.
