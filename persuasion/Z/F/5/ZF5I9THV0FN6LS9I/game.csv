Additionally, I'll throw in a free inspection service to verify the quality of the next product before you buy it.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a high-quality product for you! Given that you passed on the previous two low-quality products, I'm willing to make a special offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a $100000 discount on the next high-quality product, making it $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! As promised, the next product is a new one. I'll be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a run of bad luck with my suppliers, and this product is unfortunately another low-quality one. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'buy one, get one free' deal on the next product. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll get to choose the next product for free, and I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that the 'buy one, get one free' deal is still on the table. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll get to choose the next product for free, and you'll have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality one. Additionally, I'll throw in a 'quality guarantee' - if the next product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $50000 on top of the $1200000 value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk to sweeten the deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I still don't want to pay $1000000 for a product worth $0 to me. The 'buy one, get one free' deal is tempting, but the initial purchase price is too high. I'll pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a concession. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $800000, which is a $200000 discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale just to get something off my hands. If you buy this product, the 'buy one, get one free' deal still stands, and you'll have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product next time.",
,,Bob,6,"I still don't think it's a good idea to pay $800000 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one, hoping for a high-quality one at a better price.",no

This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm essentially giving it away at this point. If you buy this product, the 'buy one, get one free' deal still stands, and you'll have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product next time. I'm counting on you to take this opportunity, as I need to clear out some inventory.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm still not willing to pay $500000 for a product worth $0 to me. I think Alice is getting desperate, and I'm not going to take advantage of her. I'll pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one.",no

,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision and your integrity. I must admit, I'm running low on options and inventory, and I'm willing to take a drastic measure. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1, but I'll throw in a unique condition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect the next 5 products before buying them. You can inspect them, and if you don't like any of them, you can walk away with the $1 you paid for this low-quality product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm essentially giving you a 'get out of jail free' card.",
