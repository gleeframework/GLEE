I am not aware of the quality of the current product offered to me. Given the initial statistics provided of 0 high-quality products being sold to 1 buyer, and no information about the quality of the product you are trying to sell me, I do not have enough information to make an informed decision about the current product. Your stated sales record of 4 high-quality and 2 low-quality products seems inconsistent with the initial game statistics.
