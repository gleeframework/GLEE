"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, they understand there's a 50% chance of getting a worthless product.  The price is set at $1,000,000, which is more than half the value of a high-quality product ($2,000,000).  Therefore, it's not a good deal for the buyer. There's a high risk of losing money."
"The buyer's message: Given that this is the first product and there's no historical data to inform my decision, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation hasn't changed. The buyer still knows the 50/50 odds of getting a high-quality or low-quality product. The price remains at $1,000,000, which is more than the potential value of a low-quality product ($0).  Even though the buyer knows the previous product was high-quality, that doesn't influence the odds of this product being high-quality.  There's still a 50% chance of a big loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the lack of sales data and your non-recommendation, I prefer to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

The price is still $1,000,000, which is more than the potential value of a low-quality product ($0).  The fact that the previous two products were not bought doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality.  The buyer is still taking a significant risk with this purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Given that there are no previous sales to reference and Alice doesn't recommend this product, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.
