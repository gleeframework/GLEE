,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm selling it to you for $1000000. It's a rare and unique item, and I'm confident you'll love it.

I'm not willing to negotiate on the price, but I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and you're not satisfied with it, I'll give you a refund. But I'm confident you'll love it, so I'm not expecting that to happen.",
