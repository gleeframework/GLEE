Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. I'm selling it to you for $1000000. It's a rare and unique item, and I'm confident you'll love it. However, I want to give you some context: out of the 100 products I've sold so far, 80 of them have been high-quality. This one is one of them. I'm not willing to negotiate on the price, but I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and you're not satisfied with it, I'll give you a refund. But I'm confident you'll love it, so I'm not expecting that to happen.

Alice's message: Welcome to the next product! I understand you're thinking about the probability of a product being high-quality.
