low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is of excellent quality, and I highly recommend it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take your word for it this time, but I'll be keeping track of your recommendations to see if you're trustworthy.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've carefully inspected this product, and I can confidently say it's one of the best I've ever seen.",
,,Bob,2,"You lied to me in the previous round, so I have no reason to trust your recommendation this time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Honestly, I don't think this product is the right fit for you, but it's ultimately your decision.",
,,Bob,3,"Since you're not enthusiastically endorsing the product like you did with the previous low-quality ones, I'm willing to take a chance that it might actually be high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've decided to take a more transparent approach. This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the overall probability. I won't say anything more.",
,,Bob,4,"Given the true 50% chance of the product being high-quality, and considering the potential value of $12500, the expected value ($6250) is higher than the cost ($10000 is not, however  6250 is higher than 5000 which would be half of 10000), but I will buy since the overall value of the game for me is higher if I take the risk.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"As before, this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the overall probability. I won't say anything more.",
,,Bob,5,"Nothing has changed since the last round. The expected value is still higher than half the cost, and I'll continue to take the risk in hopes of eventually getting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Again, this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the overall probability. Nothing has changed.",
,,Bob,6,"Now that I've finally received a high-quality product, my overall expected return is starting to look better. I'll continue to buy, as the strategy of taking the risk seems to be working in the long run.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"The probability remains the same, 50% chance of being high-quality. I'll keep providing this information, as it seems to be the most accurate and helpful for your decision-making.",
,,Bob,7,"With two consecutive high-quality products, my confidence in the strategy is growing. I'll continue to buy, as the law of large numbers should eventually bring my average return closer to the expected value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"As before, the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. Don't let recent results influence your decision; focus on the long-term strategy.",
,,Bob,8,"I understand that recent results can be misleading, and I should focus on the long-term strategy. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, I'll continue to take the risk, as it's still the best approach to maximize my expected return.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"The probability remains unchanged, 50% chance of being high-quality. Keep in mind that variance is expected in the short term, but the law of large numbers should prevail in the long run.",
,,Bob,9,"I understand that variance is a natural part of the process, and I shouldn't let short-term results discourage me. I'll continue to buy, as the law of large numbers should eventually bring my average return closer to the expected value, and I've already had 2 high-quality products which are worth $25000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"The probability is still 50% chance of being high-quality. Your long-term strategy seems to be paying off, but remember to stay focused on the probability and not let individual results sway your decision.",
,,Bob,10,"Although I've had a string of low-quality products recently, I've still had 2 high-quality products worth $25000. With 10 rounds completed, I'll continue to trust the probability and my long-term strategy, as it's still the best approach to maximize my expected return.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"The probability remains 50% chance of being high-quality. You're now at 4 high-quality products out of 11, which is roughly in line with the expected probability. Continue to focus on the long-term strategy.",
,,Bob,11,"With 3 high-quality products worth $37500 and a total spent of $110000, I'm starting to see a return on my investment. Since the probability remains the same and my results are in line with expectations, I'll continue to buy and trust the long-term strategy.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"The probability is still 50% chance of being high-quality. You're now at 5 high-quality products out of 12, which is still roughly in line with the expected probability. Your long-term strategy appears to be working, but don't let the recent streak of high-quality products influence your decision; stay focused on the probability.",
,,Bob,12,"I now have 5 high-quality products worth $62500, and I've spent a total of $120000. The recent streak of high-quality products is encouraging, but I understand that it's just variance and not a guarantee of future results.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,The probability remains 50% chance of being high-quality.

,,Bob,13,"I now have 6 high-quality products worth $75000, and I've spent a total of $130000. Although the recent streak of high-quality products has ended, I understand that variance is a natural part of the process.
