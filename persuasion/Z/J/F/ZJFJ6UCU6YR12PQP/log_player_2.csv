"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is offering the product at a fixed price of $100 and a high-quality product is worth $125 to you, it makes sense to buy it. There's a 50% chance it's high quality, and even if it's low quality, you're only losing $100. This is a good opportunity to potentially gain $25."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now negative.  Since the product is worth nothing to you if it's low quality, and there's a 50% chance of that, it's too risky to buy without a positive recommendation. You're better off waiting for a product that Alice seems confident about."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, I'm feeling lucky! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is positive again. Following the same logic from round 1, buying the product has the potential to gain $25, and the risk of losing $100 is worth taking. The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't change the odds for this round, as each round is independent."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Just like in round 2, Alice's recommendation is negative. It's best to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product, as you stand to lose $100.  It's better to wait for a product that Alice recommends."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
