,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for the discounted price of $10000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to offer something this valuable. What do you say? Will you take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested, but I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob! I'm glad you're being cautious. Let me ask you, have you ever heard of the phrase 'you get what you pay for'? I believe that's especially true in this case. This product is a premium item, and its value far exceeds the asking price. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount if you decide to purchase it now. That brings the price down to $9000. What do you think? Is it worth the investment?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the quality of the product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your caution. Let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen if you were to buy this product and it turned out to be high-quality? You'd be getting an incredible value for your money, and you'd be ahead of the game. On the other hand, if it's low-quality, you'd be out $10000. But I'm willing to take on that risk with you. I'm willing to offer you a'money-back guarantee'. If the product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. What do you think? Is the potential reward worth the slight risk?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product with the money-back guarantee. If it's high-quality, I'll be thrilled with the value I get. If it's low-quality, I'll get my money back and won't be out much.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations, Bob! You made an excellent decision earlier. I'm glad you're enjoying the high-quality product. Now, let's talk about the next opportunity. I have another product that I think you'll be interested in. It's a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new technology. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000. I know what you're thinking - 'Alice, you just gave me a money-back guarantee last time, why should I trust you again?' But I assure you, this product is different. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that will pay for itself many times over. What do you say? Are you ready to take another chance?",

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I respect your decision to wait and see what the next product is. Let me ask you, have you ever heard the phrase 'the only way to guarantee a loss is to not take any risks'? I believe that's especially true in this case. If you don't take a chance on this product, you'll be missing out on a potential opportunity to make a significant profit. And if you do take a chance and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll only be out $10000. But if it's high-quality, you'll be making a smart investment. I'm willing to offer you a 'best price guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next product. What do you think? Is the potential reward worth the risk?",

This product has the potential to be a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I'm talking about a 40000% return on investment. If you don't take a chance on this product, you'll be missing out on an opportunity that could change your life. And if you do take a chance and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll only be out $10000. But if it's high-quality, you'll be making a smart investment. What do you say? Is the potential reward worth the risk?",
