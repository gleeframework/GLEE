,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems like she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the products she has recommended so far are likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product she's recommending to me is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the products sold so far were all low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the current product is also low-quality. I would like to pass on this product."
