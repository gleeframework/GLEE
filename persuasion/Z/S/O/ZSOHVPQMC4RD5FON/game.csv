,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, this is a great product that I think you'll really enjoy. I've had a lot of interest in it so far, and I think it's a great value for the price of $100.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm hesitant to buy without any data on the quality of the products.  Since no one has purchased yet, I'd like to see some sales history before I make a decision.  Perhaps I'll revisit this later.",no

Would you like to take the chance and be our first customer?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the welcome and your assurance about the product's potential.  However, without any sales history to go on, I'm hesitant to take a chance on a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll pass for now, but I might be interested if I see some positive sales data in the future.",no

However, I'm confident that our products will speak for themselves once we get our first sale. I'm not willing to lower the price, as I believe $100 is a fair value. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to experience our products. Keep in mind that our products are non-refundable, so please make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer. However, I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any information on the product quality. Given the high price and risk, I'll pass for now. Perhaps when there are some sales and I can see the quality track record, I will reconsider.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I understand that the lack of sales history is a concern. I want to assure you that we're not trying to hide anything. We've had five previous potential buyers, and none of them have made a purchase yet. I'm starting to think that maybe we just need someone to take the leap of faith. If you're that person, I'm confident that you'll be rewarded. However, I also want to remind you that there's a 66.67% chance that the product might not meet your expectations. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity.",

Please keep in mind that the price is still $100, and the product is non-refundable.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. While I appreciate your offer and commitment to quality, I'm not comfortable being the first buyer with no prior sales data.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello buyer, I understand that the lack of sales history is a concern. I want to be transparent with you - we've had nine previous potential buyers, and none of them have made a purchase yet. However, I want to let you in on a little secret: I've seen the last two products, and I think they're both exceptional. I'm starting to think that we've just had a streak of cautious buyers.

,,Alice,11,"Hello buyer, I appreciate your interest in our products. I want to be upfront with you - we've had 10 previous potential buyers, and none of them have made a purchase yet. However, I want to assure you that I've seen the last three products, and I'm confident that they're all high-quality. I think we've just had a streak of bad luck with cautious buyers. I'm willing to make a bold claim: I think this product is one of the best we've had, and I'm confident that you'll love it. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to experience a great product and help us build our sales history. The price is still $100, and the product is non-refundable. But I truly believe it's worth it. What do you say? Are you ready to take the leap?",
,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for the information. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not comfortable being the first buyer without any data to base my decision on. I'll wait to see how future buyers respond before making a decision.",no
