"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm giving you a chance to buy it now, but keep in mind that I have 19 more products to offer. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep offering you products until you decide to buy one. The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already bought one product from me, and now I'm offering you another one. The price remains the same at $10000. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy this one, you'll get to know its quality immediately, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this one, let's wait and see what the next one is like.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: You've decided to wait and see what the next one is like. I'll give you some additional information: the fact that you didn't buy the previous low-quality product doesn't change the probability of this one being high-quality. It's still 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. If you buy it, you'll get to know its quality immediately, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.

Alice's message: Congratulations on buying the previous high-quality product! You've made a great decision. Now, I'm offering you another product, and I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9000. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the discounted price, thanks for the offer!""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: You're being cautious, and I don't blame you. Two low-quality products in a row is a bad streak. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. You've only seen two low-quality products out of four total products, which means the probability of the next one being high-quality is still quite high. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price as the previous discounted one, $9000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still feeling a bit skeptical, I'll wait and see what the next one is like.""}"

However, I still maintain that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price as the previous discounted one, $9000. I'm willing to take on some of the risk with you, and I think this one might be worth considering.

Round 9
Alice's message: You're extremely skeptical now, and I don't blame you. Four low-quality products in a row is a concerning trend. I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to think that I might have a higher proportion of low-quality products than I initially thought. However, I still have 11 more products to offer, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for a significantly discounted price of $5000. It's a risk, but it might be worth considering if you're looking to get back into the game.

Round 10
Alice's message: You're not willing to take the risk, and I don't blame you. Five low-quality products in a row is a very concerning trend. I want to be upfront with you: I think I might have made a mistake in my initial assessment of the product quality. I'm willing to offer you this one for a very low price of $2000, essentially giving it away. If you're still not willing to take the risk, I'll keep offering you products until you're ready to buy.

I'm willing to admit defeat and offer you this one for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm willing to eat the cost and start fresh with a new batch of products. If you're still not interested, I'll stop offering you products and we can part ways.

Since you've already taken a refund, I'll throw in an additional $1000 on top of that, making it a total of $11000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with this product. What do you say?
