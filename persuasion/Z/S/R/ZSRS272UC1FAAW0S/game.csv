high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially guessing."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality. I'd also like to know if I can get more information about the product's quality, such as its probability of being high or low quality, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the previous buyers' purchases. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which is a 75% success rate. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is reliable, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased, it's possible that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers who are more likely to buy. I'd like to wait and see if you'll be able to get a recommendation after I've passed on the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product to see if the next product has a higher proportion of low-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products to some buyers. I'll wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products and 3 of those were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (3/4 = 0.75), I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and why you're not recommending this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low quality of the recommendation."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, please."
