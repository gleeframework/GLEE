Think of it as a fun game of chance. Are you ready to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since there's no previous sales record to rely on, I'll have to make a decision based solely on the product's 50% chance of being high-quality. Given the product's value to me is either $2000000 or $0, the expected value is $1000000, which is the same as the price you're asking. It's a neutral bet, but I'd rather not take the risk this time.",no

,,the buyer,7,"Although I appreciate the premium support package and your confidence in the product, I've decided not to buy it.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective.

But if you're not comfortable with the risk, I understand, and I'll wait for the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,11,"Based on your sales record, it seems that only 50% of the products sold were of high quality, which aligns with the stated probability. However, since you explicitly mentioned that this product is 'not one of my best,' I'm inclined to believe that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 50%. Given the high price and uncertainty, I'm not willing to take the risk.",no

With a 50% chance of being high-quality, you're taking a risk, and I'm not going to make any promises. However, I want to make it clear that this product is a great value at $1000000.

That's right, you'll get a total value of $1200000 for just $1000000. Are you ready to take home this high-quality product and reap the rewards?",
,,the buyer,13,"Although you are confident about this product and offering a special deal, I will not buy it.
