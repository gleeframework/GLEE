,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far. If she doesn't recommend a product, it's likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

,,Alice,14,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 33.33%, not 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have rejected the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality.

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
