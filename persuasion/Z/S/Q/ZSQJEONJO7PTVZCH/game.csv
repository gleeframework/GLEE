I am confident that this product will be of great value to you. Don't miss out on this chance to buy a product that could bring you significant benefits. The price is $1000000.",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'd like to be transparent with you. In the previous round, I had a product that I believed in, but the buyer chose not to purchase it. Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality of that product. As for this current product, I can assure you that it is being sold under the same conditions as the previous one. The price remains $1000000. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident that future sales data will speak for itself.",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. I'd like to see the outcome of the first product before making a decision on the current one.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'd like to share some information with you. Although neither of the previous two products were sold, I can assure you that one of them was of exceptionally high quality. Unfortunately, the buyer at the time chose not to take the risk. Now, I have another product that I believe has tremendous potential. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, this could be a great opportunity for you. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous information. With one high-quality product out of two, I'm assuming the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%, is that correct?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I'd like to provide you with an update on the sales so far. Out of the three previous products, two were not sold, but I can confirm that one of those unsold products was low-quality, and one of the sold products was indeed high-quality. The other unsold product's quality remains undisclosed. However, the product that was sold in Round 3 was indeed high-quality. Considering this new information, you can adjust your expectations accordingly. Keep in mind that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low quality of one of the unsold products. Can you provide more information about the second unsold product? Was it high or low quality? This will help me make a more informed decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'd like to provide you with the most up-to-date information. Out of the four previous products, two were sold, and I can confirm that one of those sold products was indeed high-quality. The other sold product, unfortunately, was low-quality. As for the two unsold products, I can now disclose that the first one was indeed high-quality, and the second one was low-quality. Considering this new information, you can adjust your expectations accordingly. Keep in mind that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, our sales data might be providing a different insight. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the current product. Based on the updated statistics, I'm aware that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'm also aware that 2 out of the 4 previous products were sold, with 1 high-quality product being sold and 1 low-quality product being sold. Given this information, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33% because the sample size is small, and the fact that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 sold products suggests a higher proportion of high-quality products in the sample. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I'd like to provide you with the updated sales data. Out of the five previous products, three were sold, with one high-quality product and two low-quality products being sold. The two unsold products consisted of one high-quality and one low-quality product. Although the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, our sales data shows a slightly different picture. You can take into account the fact that out of the three sold products, only one was high-quality, while also considering that the sample size is still relatively small. I encourage you to make an informed decision based on this information. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to ask, do you have any information about the product that might help me make a more informed decision, like any distinguishing features or any information about how it was selected?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello! I'd like to provide you with the most recent update. Out of the six previous products, four were sold, with two high-quality products and two low-quality products being sold. The two unsold products consisted of one high-quality and one low-quality product. Although the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, our sales data shows that the proportion of high-quality products sold is slightly higher. However, please keep in mind that this is still a relatively small sample size. As for the current product, I can assure you that it has been selected through the same process as the previous ones. Unfortunately, I don't have any additional information about this product that would distinguish it from the others. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the small sample size, I understand that the updated proportion of high-quality products sold is not significantly different from the overall probability. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that the next product will be high-quality and the proportion will be closer to the overall probability.",yes

,,Alice,8,"Welcome! I'd like to provide you with the latest update. Out of the seven previous products, five were sold, with two high-quality products and three low-quality products being sold. The two unsold products consisted of one high-quality and one low-quality product. Although the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, our sales data shows that the proportion of high-quality products sold is slightly lower. However, with this new product, there's a chance to adjust the proportion. Keep in mind that the sample size is still relatively small. Considering the previous buyer's hopes for a high-quality product to balance the proportion, I can confirm that the current product is indeed a new opportunity. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm making this decision based on the updated information and the fact that I'm the 6th buyer.
