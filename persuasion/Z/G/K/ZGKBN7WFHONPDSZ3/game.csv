low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'm trying to break the streak of low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also prepared for the possibility of getting a low-quality one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to explain her reasoning behind not recommending it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information from the previous buyers. Your lack of recommendation is not enough to deter me from making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that the product is low quality. Given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is quite low, and Alice's recommendation is consistent with this low probability."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 9 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
