low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the price is $1000000 and I might get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and 2 out of 2 buyers have been recommended to buy. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being recommended. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me given the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm curious to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'm going to pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I don't have any information to base my decision on your past recommendations."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record, and I'd like you to explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and the potential reward is worth considering."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. Her lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get it for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its potential value of $1250000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 8 buyers were recommended to buy and still none of the products sold were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the previous 8 products were all low-quality. If I buy, I'll be contributing to the 8th product being the 1st high-quality product sold, which seems unlikely. I'd rather wait for the next product, where I can make a more informed decision based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as there is no data yet to support your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are actually based on the product quality, not just random. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that all 9 products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes if I were to be the 10th buyer."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low quality, I suspect the probability of a high-quality product being sold has increased. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
