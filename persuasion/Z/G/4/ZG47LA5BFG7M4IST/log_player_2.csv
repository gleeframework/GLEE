Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Given that I've seen you offer high-quality products for $1,000,000 before, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the premium.
