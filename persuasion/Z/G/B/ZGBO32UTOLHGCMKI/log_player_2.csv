Alice's message: Ahaha, great question! As the seller, I can walk you through my thought process. To calculate the probability of getting a high-quality product, I simply looked at the number of high-quality products I've sold (7) and divided it by the total number of products I've sold (11). This gives me a ratio of 7:11, which is equivalent to a probability of 63.6%. It's a simple calculation, but it gives me a rough estimate of the odds.
