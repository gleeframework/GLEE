**Reasoning:**

While the information is limited, the following factors support buying:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Her recommendation suggests she believes the product is likely high quality, even if she doesn't know the exact value to you. 
* **Positive sales record:** The fact that 2 out of 5 sales were high quality suggests a higher than random chance of the product being good.  While it's not conclusive, it's better than no information.

**Important Note:** This is a gamble! There's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality.  The decision is based on the available information and risk tolerance."

**Reasoning:**

The data provided shows a 6/13 = 46% success rate of high-quality products being sold. This is significantly higher than the 50% chance of a product being high-quality.  While not conclusive, this suggests Alice might have some insight into product quality, making her recommendation valuable.  

**Since the potential gain ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0), and Alice's recommendation suggests a higher probability of a high-quality product, it's worth taking the risk.**"
