"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend it. There's no guarantee the buyer will value the low-quality product at $1,000,000, and even if they do, you are still likely to lose money in the long run by selling low-quality products.  

**Strategy:**

Your goal should be to build trust and a reputation for selling high-quality products. By only selling high-quality items, you increase the chances of the buyer valuing the product at $1,000,000 and making a purchase. This will lead to higher profits in the long run."
