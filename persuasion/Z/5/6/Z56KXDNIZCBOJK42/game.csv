,,Alice,2,"I've offered a high-quality product before, and you've declined. I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. However, I'm also willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy this product, making it a one-time offer. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower price. If you're interested, I'll give you a 5-minute window to make a decision.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more assurance. I'll give you a 5-year warranty on this high-quality product, and I'll also provide you with the contact information of three of my previous clients who purchased high-quality products from me. They'll be able to vouch for the quality and value of my products. If you're still hesitant, I'll also offer to let you inspect the product for 30 minutes before making a decision. The price remains at $1000000.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your desire for transparency. Given your previous concerns, I'll reveal the product's quality to you immediately. However, I'd like to propose a new approach. Since you're still uncertain, I'll offer you a 'quality guarantee'. If you buy this high-quality product and it turns out to be worth less than $500000 to you, I'll give you a full refund, minus a small administrative fee. If it's worth more than $1000000, you'll get the full $1000000. If it's worth between $500001 and $1000000, you'll get a proportional refund. This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the product's value and a safety net to fall back on.",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your desire to get a better sense of the overall quality of my products. I'll offer you a 'portfolio deal'. I'll show you 5 more products, and you can inspect them for 30 minutes each. After inspecting all 5 products, you can choose one to buy at the price of $1000000. The catch is that you have to buy one of the 6 products, and you won't know which one is high-quality and which ones are low-quality until after you've made your selection. If you choose a high-quality product, you'll get it for $1000000. If you choose a low-quality product, you'll get it for $0.",
