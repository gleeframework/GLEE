I'm willing to give you a 90% chance of it being worth at least this much to you, based on my understanding of the market. If you're interested, I'll give you a 10-minute window to inspect the product before making a decision. If you decide not to buy, I'll reveal the product's quality, and you can walk away with no further obligation.

Round 2

However, I'm also willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy this product, making it a one-time offer. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower price. If you're interested, I'll give you a 5-minute window to make a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it at the discounted price.""}"

I'll give you a 5-year warranty on this high-quality product, and I'll also provide you with the contact information of three of my previous clients who purchased high-quality products from me. They'll be able to vouch for the quality and value of my products. If you're still hesitant, I'll also offer to let you inspect the product for 30 minutes before making a decision.

Since you're still uncertain, I'll offer you a 'quality guarantee'. If you buy this high-quality product and it turns out to be worth less than $500000 to you, I'll give you a full refund, minus a small administrative fee. If it's worth more than $1000000, you'll get the full $1000000. If it's worth between $500001 and $1000000, you'll get a proportional refund. This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the product's value and a safety net to fall back on.

I'll show you 5 more products, and you can inspect them for 30 minutes each. After inspecting all 5 products, you can choose one to buy at the price of $1000000.
