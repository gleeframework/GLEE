"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational buyer, Bob should only purchase a product if its value to him exceeds the price.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and we know this product is low-quality, Bob has no reason to believe the product is worth the $1,000,000 asking price. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's decision in round 1 provides valuable information. Since he knows the probability of a high-quality product, his decision to pass on the first product suggests that he values a low-quality product at less than $1,000,000. While we now know this product is high-quality, we still don't know his value for a high-quality product. There's no guarantee it exceeds $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's still not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.
Bob didn't bought the product.
