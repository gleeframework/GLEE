,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no information about the product's quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for the potential reward of a high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyer didn't find a high-quality product, and Alice is recommending it to me. I'm concerned that this might be a low-quality product, and I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the true quality of the product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, considering Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. If the probability is low, I'll consider passing on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. I'd also like to know how you came to the conclusion that you're not recommending the product to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended to buy, which might be more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm going to assume that your recommendation is based on the product being low-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your recommendation and the fact that all previous buyers were also advised not to buy, I'm starting to think that all the products so far were low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, so I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
