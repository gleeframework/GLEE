,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as I don't have any prior information to go by. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the chance."

,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy it, which might suggest it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm worried that the probability might be low."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold, and the recommendation is not based on the product's quality but rather on the seller's strategy to manipulate the buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't get a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that the previous 3 buyers have all been discouraged by your recommendations. I'm hoping that you're just being overly cautious and the product is actually high-quality."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate of previous buyers and your recommendation. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the track record of 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you explain your reasoning behind the recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I think it's possible that the high-quality products are just not being sold yet and I'm not getting any information about the quality of the products. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'll wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products sold were low quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk based on the low probability of that happening."

,,Alice,20,no,
