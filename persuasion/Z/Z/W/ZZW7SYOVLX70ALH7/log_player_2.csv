Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're interested in the distribution of the high-quality products. After analyzing our sales data, we found that the high-quality products were not randomly distributed among the 17 products. Instead, we noticed a pattern where the high-quality products were more likely to be sold in consecutive rounds. This means that if you buy a high-quality product, you're more likely to get another high-quality product in the next round. I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $1000000.
