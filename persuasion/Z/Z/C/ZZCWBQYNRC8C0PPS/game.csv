,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and a total of 1 product. I'm glad you're interested in my product, but I want to be transparent with you. The product I'm offering now is actually a low-quality one. I'm selling it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the high-quality one. I'm not sure what you think this product is worth, but I'm hoping you'll consider the value of the experience and the fact that you're getting a unique opportunity to own a product that's been sold to someone else for the same price.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the information provided, I will pass on this product. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your offerings.",no

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you, and I'll provide you with the same level of transparency as before. However, I do want to point out that the price of $10000 is a great value, considering the quality of the product. I'm not sure what you think this product is worth, but I'm hoping you'll consider the fact that the product you saw in the previous round was low-quality, and this one is high-quality.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the transparent information, Alice. Based on the statistics you provided, it seems the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%. Considering the price and the fact that the last product was high-quality, I believe the risk is worth the potential reward. I would like to purchase the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products. I'm glad you're interested in my product. However, I want to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually 50%, not 100% as it might seem. The previous product was high-quality, but that was just a coincidence. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, and I'm not sure what you think it's worth. But I will say that the fact that the last two products had different qualities suggests that the quality of the product is not necessarily correlated with the price or the previous product's quality.",

However, I want to caution you that this could also be due to chance. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, and I'm not sure what you think it's worth.
