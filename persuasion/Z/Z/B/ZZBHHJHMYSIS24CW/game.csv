,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, which may not reflect the true quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous sale record, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, but since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low sample size and the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low recommendation and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, I think the probability of the product being low-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind recommending this product to me? I've only seen one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. I'm concerned that this might be a case of survivorship bias, and the low-quality products might have been passed on by previous buyers. Can you provide more information about the sales record, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she knows how much each product is worth to me, and she might be trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
