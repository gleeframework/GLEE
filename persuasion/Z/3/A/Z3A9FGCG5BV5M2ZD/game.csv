,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in buying the product, but I want to confirm its quality before committing to the purchase.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the first product. This one is definitely high-quality, and I can confirm it's worth $400 to you. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm glad to hear that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to pay the asking price of $100 for it.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! This one is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. You know how much value you can get out of it, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm feeling lucky, and I'm willing to take another chance. I'll buy this product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Sorry to say, but this one isn't as lucky as the others. I'll be upfront with you, I've had a string of high-quality products lately, and this one is actually a low-quality item. I'm still offering it to you for $100, but I want to make sure you're aware of the difference in value.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for being honest with me, Alice. Given that this product is low-quality and only worth $0 to me, I think I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"No worries at all, Bob! I appreciate your honesty too. This one's a low-quality product as well, and I'm not trying to hide it from you. I'm actually willing to offer it to you for $50, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's still not worth much to you, but it might be worth considering at this price.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but even at $50, the product is still not worth much to me, and I don't think it's a good use of my resources. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand, Bob. I'm starting to think that I might have a streak of low-quality products going on. I'll be upfront with you, I'm not sure what's going on with my inventory, but I'm willing to offer this one to you for $20. It's a deep discount, and I'm not making much on it, but I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and give it a home.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to be transparent about the product's quality. However, even at $20, the product is still not worth much to me, and I don't think it's a good use of my resources. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely get it, Bob. I think I've made it clear that this one's a low-quality product, and you're not interested. To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if I should just give it away for free at this point. Would you be willing to take it off my hands for... nothing? Just to get it out of my inventory?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll have to pass on this one. Even if it's free, the product is still not worth anything to me, and I don't want to clutter up my inventory with something that has no value.",no
