high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but I'm only doing this to get a better understanding of the distribution of product quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I already have a high-quality product and I don't want to spend another $1000000. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear so I can get a better sense of the distribution of product quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, I need to get a better sense of the distribution of product quality, and buying this one will give me a second high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've got two high-quality products now, and I'm starting to think that most of the products are high-quality. I'll pass on this one to see if I can get a low-quality product to appear."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,This is getting suspicious. Three high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice is just sending me high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product to appear.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,Four high-quality products in a row? This is highly unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice knows the quality of the products and is trying to manipulate me into buying high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product to appear.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Five high-quality products in a row is almost impossible. I'm convinced that Alice knows the quality of the products and is trying to take advantage of me. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product to appear, or I might just decide to stop playing altogether."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,I'm done. I'm not going to fall for this anymore. I'm convinced that Alice knows the quality of the products and is trying to take advantage of my greed. I'm out.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Wait, Alice is not recommending it? This is a change of heart! I think I see what's going on here. If Alice knows the quality of the products, she would have recommended it by now. I'll take the risk and buy this one, it's probably a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice's behavior is consistent with her knowing the quality of the products, but not recommending a high-quality product suggests that this one might be low-quality. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not optimistic."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"This is getting ridiculous. Alice is consistently not recommending the product when it's high-quality, and I'm still buying it. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to trick me into buying all the high-quality products. I'll take the bait one more time, but I'm not happy about it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just trolling me at this point. I've been burned six times in a row, and I'm still buying. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting anything good to come of it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"At this point, I'm not even surprised anymore. I'm just going through the motions. I'll buy the product, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm starting to think that I should just buy every product Alice recommends against, since it's clearly a high-quality product. It's like Alice is trying to give me a free high-quality product, but I'm not sure why she's doing it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm just going to go with the flow at this point. I'll buy every product Alice doesn't recommend, since it's probably high-quality. I'm just hoping I can get one low-quality product to balance things out."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Finally! I've been waiting for this moment. I'm going to take Alice's advice and pass on the product, since it's probably high-quality. I'm glad I was wrong for once!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Ugh, not again! I thought I had finally learned my lesson, but I guess I'm back to buying high-quality products when Alice doesn't recommend them. I'll just have to keep playing along and hope that the low-quality product appears again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just trolling me at this point. I'll buy the product, but I'm not going to get my hopes up. I'll just wait for the inevitable low-quality product to appear so I can finally get a break."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not falling for it. Alice has been recommending high-quality products for too long, and I'm not going to take the bait. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product to appear."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Finally! I've been waiting for this moment. I'm going to take Alice's advice and pass on the product, since it's probably high-quality. I'm glad I was right for once!"
