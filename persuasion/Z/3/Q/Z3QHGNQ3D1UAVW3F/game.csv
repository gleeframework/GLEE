,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a low-quality item. If you're interested, I'll give you a chance to buy it for $10000.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass on this one, but I'm interested in seeing what the next product has to offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No worries about the first one! This second product is also a great deal. I'll be honest with you, I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to clear out some inventory. $10000 is a steal for a product like this. You won't find a better deal anywhere else, I promise!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.",no

,,Alice,3,"Alright, I understand you're a tough negotiator. Let me make it simple: I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $10000, and I'll throw in a free'satisfaction guarantee'. If you're not happy with it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund. That's a $10000 product for $10000, plus a free get-out-of-jail-free card. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not falling for the free satisfaction guarantee. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Now this is a product that's worth talking about! I've had this one in my inventory for a while, and I've been waiting for the right buyer to come along. This is a top-of-the-line item, and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a steal considering its quality and value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great deal on a truly exceptional product.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'm not going to take the bait.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've already offered you a deal on three low-quality products, and you've passed on all of them. I'm starting to think you're not interested in getting a good deal. Let me ask you, are you looking for a product that's going to make you money, or are you just looking for a product to waste your money on? This one's still available for $10000, and I'm willing to let it go for that price. What's it going to be?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm looking for a product that will make me money, and I'm not going to waste my money on a low-quality item. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy businessperson who wants to make a smart investment. I respect that. Let me make you a deal: I'll give you a 'limited-time-only' offer on this product. If you buy it now, I'll throw in a 'certification of authenticity' that guarantees this product is... um... 'as-is'. That's a $10000 product for $10000, with a special bonus that's only available to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not falling for the 'limited-time-only' sales pitch. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Alright, I'll stop with the sales pitches and get straight to the point. I'll be honest with you, Bob, I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying anything from me. But I'm willing to keep offering you products until you say yes. This one's still available for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll just keep offering you more products until you make a decision.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying something just to buy something. I'll wait for a high-quality product, and I'm not in a rush.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've got a whole warehouse full of products, and I'm starting to think you're going to be here for a while. Fine. I'll keep offering you products until you make a decision. But let me ask you, don't you think it's getting a little silly to keep passing on these deals? I'm offering you a product for $10000, and you're just saying no. What's the harm in taking a chance?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to take a chance on a product just to take a chance. I'll keep waiting for a high-quality product at a fair price.,no

But I'll tell you what - I'll throw in a special bonus. If you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed breakdown of its features and specifications, so you can see exactly what you're getting.

,,Alice,10,"Fine, I'll stop trying to sweeten the deal. This is it, Bob. This is the last high-quality product I have. I've been holding onto it for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. I'm not going to negotiate further, I'm not going to throw in any extras, and I'm not going to offer you any discounts. This is it. You either buy it, or you walk away. The choice is yours.",

,,Alice,11,"Congratulations on making a great decision with the previous product! I'm glad I could finally find a buyer who appreciates quality. Now, let's move on to the next one. I'll be honest with you, Bob, this one's not as good as the last one. But it's still a decent product, and I'm willing to let it go for... $10000.

Yes, the same price as the last one. But trust me, this one's worth it. You won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else. I'm making a concession by offering it to you at this price. Don't pass it up!",

,,Alice,15,"You're a smart businessman, Bob. I'll give you that. But I'm starting to wonder if you're just being stubborn. This product is a complete loss leader.

This is a top-of-the-line product, and I'm willing to let it go for... $10000. Yes, I know you said you're not interested, but I think this one's worth reconsidering.
