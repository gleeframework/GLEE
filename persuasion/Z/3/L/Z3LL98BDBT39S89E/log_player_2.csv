Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the probability! Based on the data we have so far, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. The fact that the first 3 products were all high-quality doesn't necessarily change the underlying probability, as each product is an independent event.

Upon reviewing the data, I can tell you that the high-quality products have been distributed fairly evenly across the sales, with no apparent patterns or biases.
