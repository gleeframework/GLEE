Alice's message: I see you're a numbers person! You're right to be cautious, but I'd like to offer a different perspective. Even with 5 high-quality products out of 6 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. But I'll give you an additional data point: I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row would mean I've sold 6 out of 7 total products, which would be a significant deviation from the expected 80% probability. If I were to sell another high-quality product, it would be a strong indication that the probability is higher than 80%. Would you like to take advantage of this potential opportunity?
