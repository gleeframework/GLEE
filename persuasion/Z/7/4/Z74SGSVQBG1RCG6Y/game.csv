high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%), which suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
