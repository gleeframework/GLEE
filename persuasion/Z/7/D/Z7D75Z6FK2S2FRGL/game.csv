low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low number of sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and I'll get the value of $120."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that you recommended it and 2 previous buyers also bought, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I suspect that the seller might be recommending products based on their quality, which would be unfair. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change the fact that there's a 50% chance of it being low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. If 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find the product high quality, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests the product might be low-quality, which means I'm not expecting a high return on investment. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it at the fixed price of $100, hoping it's low-quality and I can pass on the loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product. I think it's likely that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality, so I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. Given that Alice's recommendation is not based on the quality of the product, I'm going to assume she's just trying to make a sale. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?
