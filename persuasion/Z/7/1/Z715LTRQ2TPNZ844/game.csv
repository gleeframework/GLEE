high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Congratulations on taking the chance and purchasing our previous product! We're happy to provide you with the confidence interval for the proportion of high-quality products sold.

As for the probability of this specific product being high-quality given the data, we can estimate it using Bayes' theorem. Assuming a uniform prior distribution for the probability of the product being high-quality, we can estimate the posterior probability to be around 0.43. This means that, given the data, there is a 43% chance that this product is high-quality. We're offering this new product to you for the same special price of $1000000. What do you think?
