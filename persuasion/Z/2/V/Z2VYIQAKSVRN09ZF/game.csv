high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, since Alice is recommending it, it's possible that she has some information that I don't have. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
