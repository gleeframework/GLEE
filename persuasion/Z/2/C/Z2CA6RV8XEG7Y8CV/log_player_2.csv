"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know the quality of the product and we know there's an 80% chance of it being high quality, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product.  The potential gain of $100 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (if it's low quality)."

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm trusting your judgment, and since you're not recommending it, I'll respect your decision.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation matters:**  The fact that Alice is NOT recommending this product is a significant change from the previous rounds. While we don't know why she's not recommending it, we should respect her decision.
* **Uncertainty:** We still have the 80% chance of the product being high quality, but now we have an additional piece of information - Alice's lack of recommendation.  This could be due to her having insider knowledge or a change in her strategy.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is still the same ($100 profit), but now the risk is higher because Alice's judgment is seemingly against buying the product. 

Since we don't have information about Alice's reasons for the change in recommendation, it's safer to play it safe and pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. Even though the product could be good, I'm going to pass on this one based on your recommendation. I'll trust your judgment.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information, even though we don't know her reasoning.  The previous round's result, where a non-recommended product turned out to be low quality, reinforces the importance of her judgment.  Even though there's still an 80% chance of the product being high quality, the risk of it being low quality is too high to justify buying it without her recommendation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm going to trust your judgment and take a chance on this one.  Let's see if your streak is back!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation Matters:** Alice has changed her strategy, and we saw her recommendations have been accurate in the previous rounds.
* **Weighing the Odds:** Even though we've had two consecutive low-quality products, the inherent probability of a product being high quality is still 80%.  
* **Trusting the Pattern:** It seems like Alice is providing valuable information about the quality of the products. Trusting her judgment again, even after the recent streak of low-quality products, is the most logical decision.  

It's a calculated risk, but given Alice's recent accuracy and the high chance of a product being high quality, buying seems like the best course of action."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  While I'm sure there's a good chance this product is high quality, I'm going to follow your lead and pass this time.  Let's see what happens!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been consistently valuable, so her lack of recommendation for this round is a significant signal. Even though the product has a higher chance of being high quality, the risk of it being low quality is not worth taking without Alice's approval. This decision is based on the pattern observed in the previous rounds and the trust in Alice's judgment."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trusting your judgment again. Let's see what we've got!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendations Matter:** Alice's recommendations have been consistently valuable in predicting the quality of the products, even though we don't know how she determines them.
* **Trusting the Pattern:** Despite a few recent low-quality products, her track record shows that her recommendations are generally accurate. 
* **Weighing the Odds:** The inherent probability of a product being high quality is still 80%.  

While there's always a risk of a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation increases our confidence that this particular product is more likely to be high quality. It's a calculated risk, but based on the pattern of the game, buying is the most sensible decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
