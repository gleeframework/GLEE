Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide some transparency. Out of the 1 product I've sold so far, 1 has been high-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $10000. It's a great chance to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right that the data suggests there might be more high-quality products left. But let me put it this way: if you buy this one, you'll be getting a 50% chance of a $20000 product for $10000. If you wait, you'll have to rely on the law of large numbers to get a better estimate of the product quality. Why not take the sure thing now?
