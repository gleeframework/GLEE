Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. I'm still learning about my products, and I'd love to get your feedback. This product is available for $100, but I want to be transparent with you: I've had a 100% success rate so far, which is unusually high. I'm curious to see if that changes with this next product.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products now. However, I want to be upfront with you: the fact that I've sold two high-quality products in a row is suspiciously good luck. I'm starting to think that I might be overestimating the quality of my products. Would you like to take the chance and buy this one for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance. Although your statistics seem suspiciously good, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80% according to the problem statement. Since the product is worth $120 to me if it's high quality and I'm paying $100, the expected value is still positive ($120 * 0.8 - $100 = $16). So, I'll buy it.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to feel like I've got a reputation for selling high-quality products. But I know that's not necessarily a good thing - it might just mean I'm being too confident and overestimating the quality of my products.
