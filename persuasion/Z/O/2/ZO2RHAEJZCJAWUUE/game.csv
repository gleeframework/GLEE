You've now had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. I want to give you a chance to reassess the situation. Considering the cost of this product is $100, and the value of a high-quality product is $120, would you be willing to take the risk and buy this product, or would you rather wait for the next round?",
