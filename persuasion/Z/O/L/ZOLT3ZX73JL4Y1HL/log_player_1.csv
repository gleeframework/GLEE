}"
"The buyer's message: I'm concerned that the previous 3 high-quality products were a coincidence, but the fact that none of the first 2 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendations suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality.

Would you like to take the risk and buy this product?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the discounted price for the next product should be explicitly stated before I make a decision on it. Can you confirm the price for the next product if this one is low-quality?

Would you like to take advantage of the potential discount and buy it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the current product and take advantage of the potential discount. However, I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 37.5%, which is lower than the expected 33.33%.

Based on the sales data, the observed proportion of high-quality products sold is 9/16 = 56.25%, which is significantly higher than the expected 33.33%. However, it's essential to note that this is a biased sample, and we should be cautious not to overestimate the true probability. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $100.
