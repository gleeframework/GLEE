"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she is recommending you to buy, it's likely the product is high quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the risk in the first round."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is still valuable information. Since she's recommending again, it's likely she's picked another high-quality product.  While there's always a chance she's wrong, the previous successful round strengthens the likelihood of another good product."
