**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior sales data, we have no information to go by other than Alice's recommendation. Given the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($40,000) and the relatively low cost ($10,000), it makes sense to take a gamble and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $40,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk decision with limited information.  The chances of getting a low-quality product are higher (66.67%). However, the potential gain is also much higher."
