high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited, but I should let you know that the last buyer was also very confident about this product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious buyer! I appreciate that. Let me give you a more detailed breakdown: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is therefore 100%! But don't just take my word for it. If you buy this product, you'll get to experience it for yourself and see its value.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the high success rate, but I should let you know that it's not always this straightforward. The last two products were indeed high-quality, but that doesn't mean the next one will be. In fact, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which means the probability of this product being low-quality is actually higher than you might think. The price remains $100, but I want to be transparent with you - it's a riskier bet this time around.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm not convinced that the next product will be high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision.",no

The probability of this product being high-quality is now 60%. However, I want to highlight that the last product you bought was indeed high-quality, which means I've had a streak of two high-quality products in a row.
