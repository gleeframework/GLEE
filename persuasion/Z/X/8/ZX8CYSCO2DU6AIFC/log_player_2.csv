``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is incredibly limited. There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend the product because she benefits from a sale. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the current product is high quality.
* **50/50 Odds:**  The inherent 50% chance of a high-quality product still exists. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $30,000 (the difference between the product's value to me and the price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

**Conclusion:** With such limited information, it's a gamble. However, the potential reward is significant enough to justify the risk in this scenario."
