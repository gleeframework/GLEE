high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Given the randomness of the quality, it's likely that there are still many high-quality products available.
