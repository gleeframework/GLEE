Alice's message: You're right, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far, which is a 50% success rate.

After selling 2 high-quality products out of 3, my overall success rate is still only 66.67%, which is only slightly better than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product.

However, I want to be transparent about the fact that my success rate has now dropped to 75% (3 high-quality out of 5). This means that the product I have for you now is actually less likely to be high-quality than the previous one.
