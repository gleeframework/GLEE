Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're cautious, but I assure you this product is worth every penny. However, I'm willing to give you a slight nudge: I'll reveal the quality to you if you decide to buy it. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a small hint: the product is more valuable than the average product I sell.

This time, I'll give you a more concrete offer: I'll let you have this high-quality product for $100, and I'll throw in a second high-quality product of your choice from a future round. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if the offer is as good as it sounds. Can I get a guarantee that the second product will indeed be high-quality, and what's the catch?""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

However, I can only offer it to you if you buy this low-quality product for $100. Think of it as a 'buy one, get one free' deal, but the first product is a bit of a dud. Still, it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you can always sell the low-quality one for $0 if you don't like it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to buy a low-quality product, even if it comes with a free high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come up.""}"

You can think of it as a 'lottery ticket' - you might not win the jackpot, but you might get a free product in the future. Would you like to take a chance?

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else. What do you say?
