high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that there are no previous sales records, I don't have any information to go on. I'd rather wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous buyer is 50%. Given that the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy, it's possible that the product was low-quality, and Alice's recommendation was based on that. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
