Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
While you don't know Bob's valuation of high-quality products, it's still a gamble worth taking. Here's why:

* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob is clearly wary of low-quality products, likely due to the previous rounds. This suggests he values high-quality products enough to potentially take a risk.
* **Potential Gain:**  If Bob values high-quality products significantly more than $10,000, you stand to make a big profit. 
* **No Loss:** If Bob values the product less than $10,000, you lose nothing.

**The risk is minimal, while the potential reward is high.**  This is a good opportunity to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to buy a high-quality product."

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Maintaining Trust:**  You've established some trust with Bob by recommending two high-quality products in a row.  Recommending a low-quality product now would likely break that trust.
* **Potential Loss:**  Bob has shown he values high-quality products. Recommending a low-quality product might make him hesitant to buy from you in the future. 
* **No Gain:**  You're not going to make any profit from a low-quality product.

It's better to keep the momentum going and stick to recommending high-quality products until you've learned more about Bob's valuation."

* **No Potential Gain:** You have no reason to risk losing Bob's trust for a low-quality product that won't bring you a profit.

It's better to wait for a high-quality product before trying to sell to Bob again.  You can continue to observe his behavior to get a better sense of his valuation and his willingness to take risks."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I'll pass on this product. Your recommendations have been very helpful, and I'm sticking with that pattern.
