**Explanation:**

* **The Odds:** We know there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality. Since Alice has a track record of selling at least one high-quality product, it suggests she might be able to discern the quality to some degree (even if it's just a lucky guess). 
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy adds further weight to the possibility of the product being high-quality. While it's not foolproof, it increases the likelihood of a positive outcome. 
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if the product is low quality (worth $0), the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. But if it's high quality (worth $20,000), we stand to gain $10,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain outweighs the risk in this case, making buying a reasonable choice."
