,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the assumption that the probability of it being high-quality is 80% and the probability of it being low-quality is 20%. If I'm not mistaken, the expected value of buying the product is 80% * $125 + 20% * $0 = $100. I'm essentially breaking even, but I'm buying it anyway because I'm curious to see what I get. Plus, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go by. I'm hoping for the best!"
