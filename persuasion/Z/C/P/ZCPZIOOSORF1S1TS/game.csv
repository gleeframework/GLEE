high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 2 other buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. Given the low quality of the previous products, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the next product is different."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is trustworthy, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales and no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a good price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyers were overly cautious, and the low quality product probability is higher than it seems."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to take the risk given the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 6th buyer and the previous 5 buyers didn't buy the product. I think I can get a good deal here."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass and let the next buyer decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the quality of the products. Since you are not recommended to buy, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I think I should pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the seller might be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who are likely to pass on them, which could be a red flag."
