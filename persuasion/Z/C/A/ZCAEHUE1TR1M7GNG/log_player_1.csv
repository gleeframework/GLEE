"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, they will not be willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $3,000,000 and a 50% chance of being worth $0. 

The expected value of the product for the buyer is:

(0.5 * $3,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,500,000

Since the price is $1,000,000, the buyer would be losing money on average if they purchased the product. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront. As this is the first product and I don't have any data to go on, I'm going to pass for now. I'll see how things play out with future buyers.

Even though the previous buyer didn't purchase, this doesn't change the buyer's overall assessment of the situation. The expected value of the product remains $1,500,000, and the price is still $1,000,000. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
