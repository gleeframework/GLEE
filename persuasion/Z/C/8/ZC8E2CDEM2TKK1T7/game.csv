,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the product, and not on any other information. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 3 buyers have also bought the products despite your recommendations. This suggests that the products might be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if the lack of high-quality products sold is due to chance or if there's something wrong with the products, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is more likely to be low quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that they were all low-quality products. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I'm willing to take the risk and wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality might be low. Can you share your thought process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. If I buy, I'll be the first one, and I don't want to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
