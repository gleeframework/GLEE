However, I'd like to clarify that the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80%. The fact that the previous two buyers got high-quality products is simply a matter of chance, and it doesn't change the underlying probability.

This is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I would expect the proportion of high-quality products sold to be around 80% if the products were randomly selected. The fact that the proportion is higher suggests that you may be selecting the high-quality products more frequently than expected. I would like to pass on this product and see the next one.
