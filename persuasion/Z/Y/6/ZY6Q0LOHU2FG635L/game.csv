,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 products so far. I'm starting to think that I might have a string of bad luck. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $10000? It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one.  While I appreciate the price, your sales record doesn't inspire much confidence yet. I'd rather wait and see how your future sales go.",no

,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your honesty about the previous sales, I'm a little hesitant to be the first buyer with such a low track record of high-quality products. Perhaps I'll wait to see how the next few sales turn out before I make a decision.",no

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 products now, but it looks like I've hit a bit of a slump. I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which is a bit concerning.

,,the buyer,8,"Thanks for the information, Alice. While your success rate seems promising, I'm a bit hesitant given that you've only sold one product so far.

Perhaps if you could provide information about the quality of the products that were not sold, I might be more inclined to purchase.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information. Out of the 7 products that were not sold, 5 of them were low-quality. This means that the 2 products that were not sold but not revealed to you, are likely to be high-quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 products now, which is a 44.4% success rate. I think that's a strong indication that I have a good selection of high-quality products. This one is another high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take it home for $10000?",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the current product, the data suggests that your products are more likely to be low quality. As I'm risk-averse and the potential loss is significant, I'll pass on this offer.",no

,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant given the current sales record.
