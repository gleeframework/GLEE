**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though the overall chance of a product being high quality is 33.33%, the fact that Alice recommended the product and it was purchased by the previous buyer suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Limited information:** You don't have enough data to make a definitive decision, but the positive recommendation combined with the previous successful sale increases the potential payoff.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**It's important to note:** This is a strategic decision based on limited information. You are essentially gambling on the likelihood that Alice's recommendation is accurate and the product is indeed high quality."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against getting a high-quality product (66.67% chance of low quality), the fact that a high-quality product has already been sold means the current product is more likely to be high quality than the average product.  Since the product is worth $200 to me if it's high quality, and the price is only $100, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
