This way, you'll have a better understanding of the risks and potential rewards for the next two rounds. Keep in mind that the product's price remains $1000000, and it's still non-refundable.""}"

Since you've been willing to wait and observe the quality of the previous products, I'll point out that you've already missed out on three high-quality products. If you had purchased them, you would have gained a significant profit. This product is another opportunity, and I'll remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%.
