,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation seems suspicious given the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy it, I think the low-quality products have been sold already and the high-quality ones are left, Alice's recommendation is not reliable."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product to me.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
