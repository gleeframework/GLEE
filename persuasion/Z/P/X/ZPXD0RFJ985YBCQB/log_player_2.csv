Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense to buy the product, even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality item.  The recommendation from Alice doesn't change the underlying probabilities, but it does provide some additional information that could influence your decision."
