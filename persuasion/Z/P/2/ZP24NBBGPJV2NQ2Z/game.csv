,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your confidence in the product being high-quality, but I'm concerned that the probability of it being high-quality is actually less than 80% due to the law of large numbers. With only 10 products sold, the sample size is relatively small, and the observed proportion of high-quality products (8/10) might not be representative of the true population proportion.
