,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While your recommendation is compelling, I'm hesitant to buy without more data.

Perhaps if you can provide more information about your product, I may be more inclined to buy.",no

However, I'd like to highlight that 80% of my products are high-quality, and the chances are that this one is also a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a price that reflects the potential value of a high-quality product. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. But if not, I'm happy to wait for the next buyer who's willing to take a chance.",

,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence, I am still hesitant to purchase the product.

,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.
