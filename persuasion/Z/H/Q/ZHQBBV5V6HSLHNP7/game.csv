,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't know my valuation, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I would like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product and get more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would increase the proportion of low-quality products in the sales record and make it more likely that future buyers will pass on the next product, thereby increasing the chances of me getting a high-quality product in the future."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there has been 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, which is a 33.33% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I believe that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I would like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."

,,Alice,17,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'd like to know how this changes the expected value of the product. I'd also like to know the number of products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
