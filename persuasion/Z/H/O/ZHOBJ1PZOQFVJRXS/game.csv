,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20.00%. I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, but that doesn't necessarily mean this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, especially since the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. Can you give me more information about the previous buyer's experience with the product?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales and recommendations before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics so far. I want to make an informed decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first 3 buyers who bought the products were lucky and got high-quality products. I don't want to fall into the trap of confirmation bias. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the current statistics, and how it compares to the probability of a low-quality product being sold to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, not because of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous sales."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making a final decision. Can you provide the probability of the next product being high-quality?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended it, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80.00%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable since 3 out of 5 previous buyers have bought the product, which suggests that most of the products sold so far are high-quality. If I buy, I'll be overpaying for a high-quality product, and if I'm unlucky, I'll end up with a low-quality product worth $0. I'd rather wait for a product that's been passed by previous buyers, which might be a low-quality product that I can buy at the discounted price of $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you've noticed any patterns in the previous sales, and if you have any information about the product that might be relevant to its quality."
