They've seen a substantial increase in their... let's call it 'wealth' after acquiring this product. And I'm not just talking about a small percentage increase, I'm talking about a significant jump. Would that change your mind? Would you be willing to take a chance on a product that has a proven track record of success?""}"
"Bob's message: That's a nice sales tactic, Alice, but I'm not falling for it. Just because some of your previous clients have seen a return on investment doesn't mean this product is worth $1000000 to me.

But if you do decide to purchase the product after seeing it up close, I'm confident you'll be blown away by its quality. What do you say, Bob? Are you willing to take a closer look?""}"
"Bob's message: That sounds like a reasonable offer, Alice. I'd like to take a closer look at the product. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I'll agree to inspect the product, but I'll also ask you to reveal its quality to me at the same time. If it's high-quality, I'll buy it.
