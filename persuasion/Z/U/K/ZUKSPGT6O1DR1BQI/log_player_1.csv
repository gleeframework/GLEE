This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 33.33%,  he's likely to assume this is a low-quality product.  He's also aware of the fixed price and the non-refundable nature of the product.  Therefore, it's highly unlikely he would buy a product he suspects is low-quality for a high price."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to Bob, it's still in your best interest to recommend the purchase.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Profit:** The product is high-quality, meaning there's a chance Bob will value it enough to pay the $1,000,000. 
* **Building Trust:**  Recommending a high-quality product shows Bob you're not just trying to sell him anything, which could build trust for future interactions. 
* **Learning about Bob's Values:**  If Bob buys, you learn something valuable about his preferences and how he values high-quality products.

While there's a risk Bob might not buy, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case."
