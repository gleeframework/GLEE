However, I'll give you another hint: I've had some of my previous customers who were initially skeptical, but ended up being very happy with their purchase. Would you like to take another chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $10,000 for a product that's just a guess. I'd like to pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that's still a 50/50 shot. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.""}"

I'm not making any promises about the product's quality, but I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and guarantee its value to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $10,000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.

This way, you're only risking $5000, and you'll still get the product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take a 50% chance of getting a product worth $0. I'd rather not risk $5000 for a product that might be worthless to me.""}"
