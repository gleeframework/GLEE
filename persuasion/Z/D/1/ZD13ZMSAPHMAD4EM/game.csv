,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning for not recommending it. Is it because you don't know the quality distribution yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and given that the first buyer didn't buy it either, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when its value to me is $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any information that suggests the product is low quality and I'm willing to take a chance to get a high-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to see more data or a change in her strategy before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I infer that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like all previous products were low quality, so I'm skeptical about this one as well."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will make a purchase."
