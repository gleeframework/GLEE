,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no information yet to base a decision on the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the current product being low quality as well."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but both products were low quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards encouraging purchases, rather than accurately reflecting the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far, and the fact that you're not recommending it. I'll buy it and see if I get lucky!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, it seems that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the current product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a 90% confidence level that it's a high-quality product based on the previous sales record. Otherwise, I'll pass."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 4 buyers didn't find it valuable, and the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many products have been sold in total and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the 80% stated. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, so I'm going to take a chance and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that your lack of recommendation is due to a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
