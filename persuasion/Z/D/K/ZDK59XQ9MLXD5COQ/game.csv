high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product meets the highest standards. In fact, I've had two high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to think that my supplier has really upped their game. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I don't want to get too ahead of myself, but I've had a couple of great products recently. This one... doesn't quite feel the same. I'm not saying it's bad, but I don't have the same level of confidence as I did with the last two. Buyer beware, I suppose.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think I should just be honest with you and say that I'm in a slump. This product isn't great either. At this point, I'd recommend waiting until I can get some new stock from a different supplier. This batch just isn't working out.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
