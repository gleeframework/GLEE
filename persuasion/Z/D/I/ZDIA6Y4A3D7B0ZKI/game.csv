high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no information about the product's quality and a 50% chance of it being low quality, I'll pass for now."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Still no reason to trust that this product is high quality, so I'll pass again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"If Alice doesn't recommend it and I already have no reason to believe it's high quality, I'll definitely pass."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation or lack thereof hasn't been a reliable indicator so far, but without a reason to believe this one is high quality, I'll pass again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,I'll let you in on a little secret: the last 4 products were all high-quality. Maybe you should reconsider your strategy.
,,Bob,5,no,"At this point, it seems like Alice's recommendations don't correlate with the product quality. Given the 50% chance of it being low quality, I'll continue to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've passed on 5 high-quality products so far, and given the 50% chance, I'm due for a win. I'll take the risk this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"I told you the truth in round 5, the first 4 products were indeed high-quality. And I recommended the last one, which unfortunately was low-quality. Maybe you should trust my next recommendation."
,,Bob,7,no,"I just got burned on the last purchase, and Alice's recommendation or lack thereof still doesn't seem to be a reliable indicator. I'll go back to passing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Given my last purchase was a loss and Alice's recommendations haven't correlated with quality, I'll stick to passing for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Still no reason to think this product is high quality, especially with Alice not recommending it. I'll pass again."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Pattern or not, without a reliable indicator of quality, I'll continue to pass."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I've been honest about the quality of the last few products. This time, I assure you, the product is high-quality. Take a chance!"
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice's recommendations haven't been reliable so far, so I'll keep passing."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"Consider the probability of me recommending a high-quality product and you passing on it, multiple times in a row. Maybe I'm telling the truth this time."
,,Bob,12,yes,"Another high-quality product slipped through my fingers last round. Given the 50% chance, I'll take the risk again."

,,Alice,16,yes,"Don't get too confident, Bob. The streak can end anytime. Maybe take a step back and reassess?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I told you the streak would end. Now that you're cautious again, I'll be honest - this product is indeed high-quality. Maybe you should take a chance?"
,,Bob,17,no,Still no confidence in Alice's recommendations after the last failure. I'll continue to pass.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"You've passed on two high-quality products in a row now. The probability is still 50%, but maybe it's time to take another chance?"
