,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think this product is not worth buying?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased a product and it being a low-quality one, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the low odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not buying, Alice. Your previous recommendations don't give me much confidence in the product quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality. I think the probability of this product being high quality is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product. I'm curious about the previous sales record, can you share it with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and no high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about your previous sales records and the reasoning behind your recommendation?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what was the quality of the previous two products sold? I want to make a more informed decision for the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the third buyer, and the statistics show that none of the previous two products were high-quality. I'll take the chance that the product might be high-quality, given the low probability of it being high-quality (33.33%)."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is still 33.33%. If I buy this product, I'll be left with a product that is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold were low quality. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products are likely to be low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
