This means that if you buy any product from me in the next 5 rounds, and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. The price for this high-quality product remains at $10000. What do you say?

Considering the price trend, I'll offer you this high-quality product at a price that's 5% lower than the previous one. That brings the price down to $8550. Will you take it now?
