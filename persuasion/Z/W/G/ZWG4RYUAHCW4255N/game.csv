,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a premium product that has been carefully curated for you. With a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item, I'm confident that this one is a gem. It's worth $300 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a steal! Take a chance and make a great purchase today!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, given that no products have been sold yet. Is there any information you can share about the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer?",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Ahmed, welcome! Since the previous buyer declined, I'm happy to share that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is still 33.33%. This is because the first product was indeed high-quality, but that doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm excited to offer you this new product, which is also a high-quality one! It's worth $300 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a premium product at a discounted price. What do you say?",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect that. Let me put your mind at ease. Since two products have been offered so far, and one of them was high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% (based on the 33.33% initial probability and the fact that one out of two products was high-quality). I'm excited to offer you this new product, which is indeed high-quality! It's worth $300 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great chance to get a premium product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your statistics, Alice. I think you might be trying to manipulate me with the information. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens with the next one.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect that. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to manipulate you. As a seller, I'm committed to transparency and honesty. Since you're not convinced, I'll keep it simple. This product is now the 3rd one offered, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 40%. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not high-quality. It's worth $0 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I know it's not a great deal, but I'm willing to make a concession. If you're willing to take a chance, you might get lucky and get a high-quality product next time. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product has to offer.",no

However, I want to assure you that I'm still committed to offering high-quality products.
