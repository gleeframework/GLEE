Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and it's worth $3,000,000 to the buyer, while you're only asking for $1,000,000, it's a clear win for the buyer.  There's no reason to recommend against the purchase."

* **The product is low-quality:**  This product is worth nothing to the buyer.
* **Previous Sales:** Although you have sold two high-quality products, the buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a low-quality product. This risk is too high considering they'll lose $1,000,000 if they buy.

Even though you have a good sales history, the buyer will likely be wary of purchasing a product that has a 1/3 chance of being worthless."

* **Previous Sales:** You have sold five high-quality products out of nine total sales. Although this is still a relatively good record, the buyer has now seen three failed sales (Rounds 7, 8, and 9).

It's best to not recommend buying. You need to turn things around with a few high-quality products to regain their trust."

* **Previous Sales:** You have sold five high-quality products out of fifteen total sales. The buyer has now seen seven failed sales in a row (Rounds 7-11, 13-15).

* **Previous Sales:** You have sold five high-quality products out of eighteen total sales. The buyer's trust is shattered, but this is a chance to turn things around.  Even though the buyer has seen a string of bad products, they are aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product.

While the buyer is likely extremely skeptical, recommending the purchase is the only chance to get them to buy.  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product might outweigh their current lack of trust.  It's a long shot, but it's the only way to start rebuilding their trust."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, considering the recommendation and the statistics that 6 out of 6 products sold so far were high-quality.
