As a valued customer with 'Priority Access', I'm willing to give you a 50% discount on this item. That brings the price down to $5000. It's still not worth much to you, but I think it's a fair price considering the perks you'll get from buying this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the discount, Alice, I think I'll pass on this low-quality product. The value doesn't justify the cost given my current situation.""}"

But here's the twist: I'll also throw in a second high-quality product of your choice, absolutely free. You can choose any product from my inventory, and it's yours to keep. The price for this bundle is still $10000, but I think it's a steal.
