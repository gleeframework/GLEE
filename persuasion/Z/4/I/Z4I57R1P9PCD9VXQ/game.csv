,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I have no information to go on and I'm trying to get a feel for the distribution of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and what information I can use to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable, given that the first buyer didn't buy the product despite your recommendation to do so."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that none of the previous products were high-quality, which makes me skeptical about the current product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the quality for myself and update the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any insights into the quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you have any more products available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of potential buyers and the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice hasn't recommended yet, as it might be more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you're recommending not to buy it. Is it because you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. If the probability is low, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good deal. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'm concerned that this product may also be of low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected, and I'm concerned that I might be getting a low-quality product."
