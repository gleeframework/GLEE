"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Expected Value:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significantly higher than the risk ($0). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation isn't a guarantee, it does suggest that she likely has some insight into the product's quality.  This makes the decision to buy even more appealing.
* **First Round:** In the first round, there's no prior experience to base a decision on. Taking a calculated risk is the best strategy."

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. Since she knows the true value of the product, her non-recommendation is valuable information.
* **Risk Aversion:** Given the previous experience with a high-quality product, there's less pressure to take risks. Passing on a product that Alice doesn't recommend is a safer strategy, especially since a low-quality product offers no value."
