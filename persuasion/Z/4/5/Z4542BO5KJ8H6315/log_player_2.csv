Alice's message: Ahmed, the previous buyer, was thrilled with his purchase! He was one of the lucky ones who got a high-quality product, and he's now enjoying the benefits of having a valuable item worth $20000. I'm happy to report that he's already referred two friends to me, eager to experience the same excitement. With the current sales ratio, the chances of this product being high-quality are 50%. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and I'm feeling optimistic about this one. The price remains $10000, a small price to pay for the potential of getting a product worth $20000. What do you think? Are you ready to take the leap and join the ranks of satisfied customers like Ahmed?
