low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first one and there's no data to go off of. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the seller's recommendation is based on their knowledge of my valuation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for a situation where the probability of a high-quality product is higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not just trying to manipulate me by recommending low-quality products to the first two buyers. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm keeping an eye on your sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and none of them bought it, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'll take a chance. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can learn from this experience."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious about the product's quality. Can you reveal its quality to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and none of the previous products were high-quality, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this product to see if the next buyer will be more fortunate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a pattern or something I should know?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 5 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 33.33%. Since Alice recommends the product, it's likely that she has some information that I don't, but I'll take a cautious approach and pass on the product to see if the next buyer will make a different decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the average. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to get a better idea of the distribution of product quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to buy it. I'd like to know the quality of this product before making a decision, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
