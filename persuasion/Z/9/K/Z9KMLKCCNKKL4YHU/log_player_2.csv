**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product randomly.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality, especially given her perfect track record so far. 
* **Limited Risk:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the loss is only $100, which is a small price to pay for the potential gain of $125.

**Overall:** The evidence strongly suggests that the current product is high-quality, making the decision to buy a relatively low-risk, high-reward proposition."
