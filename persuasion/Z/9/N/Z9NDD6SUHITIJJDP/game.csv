,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendations have been based on the product quality, and you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products, or is it because the previous buyers didn't buy any high-quality products at all?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality.
