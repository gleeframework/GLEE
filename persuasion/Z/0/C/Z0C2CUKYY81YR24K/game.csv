high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to share some additional information. Since you're considering purchasing from us, I can tell you that 2 out of the 2 products we've sold so far have been high-quality. That's a 100% success rate! With the price remaining at $10000, I think this product has a strong potential to exceed your expectations. Are you ready to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high quality, based on the information you've shared. Can you calculate that for me?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm happy to provide that information! With 2 out of 2 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. This is because we've only sold 2 products, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. The price remains at $10000, and I'm confident you'll love it. Are you ready to take the plunge?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me offer a different perspective. The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality doesn't necessarily mean the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. It's possible that we just got lucky, and the next product could be low-quality. Or, it's possible that our high-quality products are more likely to sell first, and we haven't sold any low-quality products yet. The price remains at $10000, and I'm still confident you'll love this product. But I understand if you need more data before making a decision. Would you like to wait and see what happens in the next few rounds?",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to wait and see what happens in the next few rounds. I'm not convinced that the past results are representative of the overall quality distribution.,no

We've had some positive feedback from previous buyers, and I'm happy to share that with you. Would you like to take a chance on this product, or would you like to wait and see what's next?",
