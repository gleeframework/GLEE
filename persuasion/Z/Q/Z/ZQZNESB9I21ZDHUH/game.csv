,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  However, I'm not comfortable making a purchase without more information. I understand that the product has a guarantee, but I'd like to understand the guarantee in more detail and perhaps see some evidence of the product's quality before making a decision. Could you provide me with more information about the guarantee and perhaps some testimonials or reviews from previous buyers?",no

It is a very rare opportunity to acquire this product at this price. Are you still interested in learning more?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, I'm still hesitant.  I'm not comfortable buying a product with an unknown quality and only a general guarantee, especially at this price point.
