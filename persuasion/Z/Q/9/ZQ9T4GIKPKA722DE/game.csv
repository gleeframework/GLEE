,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and I'll find out its quality afterwards."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 sale and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, so I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the lack of sales of high-quality products so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would like to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy it, since the first buyer didn't buy it and Alice didn't recommend it, the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and the cost is $1000000, which is a lot of money, but I'll take the chance"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,16,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
