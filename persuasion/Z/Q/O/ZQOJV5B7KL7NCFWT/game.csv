,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm not sure what the recommendation is based on, and I don't want to pass up the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and there are no high-quality products sold yet, so I'm taking a risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if the product is high-quality, it's likely that the previous 3 buyers didn't get a good product, which would mean that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is relatively high. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I suspect that all the high-quality products have been sold. The probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next draw is 0, so I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,13,no,
