,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm looking for $1000000 for it. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take a chance on it. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 product, and it was not high-quality. I still have 19 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that the first product sold was low-quality, the proportion of high-quality products remaining is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if I can get a better sense of the distribution.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. I still have 18 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 50%, which is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. This makes me suspicious that the remaining products might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products out of 3 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 33.33%. I still have 17 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products is 33.33%, which is the same as the prior probability. I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on it and wait for more information.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. I still have 16 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 5 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 40%. I still have 15 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the chance, but I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall average of 33.33% and the previous sales record may be misleading due to the small sample size. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and will be worth $4000000 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 6 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 33.33%. I still have 14 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 7 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 28.57%. I still have 13 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,8,I'm not convinced that this product is high quality based on the low proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products before making a decision.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 8 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 37.5%. I still have 12 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality has increased, not because I trust your recommendation.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 9 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 44.44%. I still have 11 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take a chance. However, I'd like to know how you arrived at the 44.44% proportion of high-quality products. I've counted 2 high-quality products out of 9 sold, which is 22.22%, not 44.44%. Could you clarify this?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I made a calculation error. You are correct, the proportion of high-quality products is 22.22%. I've now sold 4 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products out of 10 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 40%. I still have 10 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take a chance, but I'm doing it because the probability of it being high-quality seems higher than the initial 33.33%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products out of 11 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 36.36%. I still have 9 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I've noticed the proportion of high-quality products is slightly lower than the expected 33.33%, which makes me slightly skeptical. I'm hoping to get a good deal.",yes

,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 38.46%, which is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products and 9 low-quality products out of 14 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 35.71%. I still have 6 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,I don't have any special method for recommending products. I simply report the actual sales data and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?,
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take a chance, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. Thanks for the transparency, Alice!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products and 10 low-quality products out of 15 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 33.33%. I still have 5 products left. I'm looking for $1000000 for this one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it.

,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the last buyer. If I were in a position to pass, I'd want to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 6 high-quality products out of 18, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 6/18 = 1/3.
