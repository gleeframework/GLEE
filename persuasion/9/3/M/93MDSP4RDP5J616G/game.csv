,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else? I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product if it's worth it."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you recommended it to me. Is there any information that you have that I don't?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences with the products?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given that all previous products were recommended by you and none were high-quality, it's likely that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the statistics, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that none of the previous 5 buyers, who presumably had better information than me, were willing to buy the product, suggesting that the product is likely low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products being offered are all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
