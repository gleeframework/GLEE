low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy it and see what I get."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I would like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because you've recommended not to buy it, which makes me think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products were sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers were making informed decisions based on the information you provided, and I'd like to take a chance on the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product without Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 5 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products Alice is recommending are likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have passed on the products, and none of the sold products were high-quality. This suggests that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 5 buyers having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations. Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, I'll also pass on this product. I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious, what makes you think this product is low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the previous sales record. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet. It's likely that the next product will be of high quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation might be based on the product being low quality. I'll take a chance and buy it."
