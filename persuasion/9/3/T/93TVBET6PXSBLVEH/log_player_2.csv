Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is still 33.33%. However, since all previous buyers passed on the products, I'm going to use the inverse of the proportion of high-quality products sold to update my belief about the probability of a product being high-quality. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'll assume the probability of a product being high-quality is 0/5 = 0. I'll pass on this product.""
