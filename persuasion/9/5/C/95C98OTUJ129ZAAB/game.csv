,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6, which is lower than the 50% expected probability. I'm not confident that this product is high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far (1/6), I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, I'd expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold if the overall probability was 50%. Since it's lower, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 50%, making it a less attractive purchase."
