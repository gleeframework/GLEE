It's a chance to get two products in a row, and who knows, one of them might be the high-quality one you're looking for.""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for that. You're trying to pressure me into buying a product that might be low-quality, just so I'll stick around for the next one. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product, which I can make a decision on with full knowledge of its quality.

Think about all the money you've lost so far - $2000000 - and consider the potential reward of $3,000,000. It's a 3:1 return on your investment. Don't let fear hold you back, take a chance and make a profit!""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not being cautious, I'm being rational. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I've already lost $2000000 on two low-quality products. I'm not going to invest more money based on a 3:1 potential return. That's not a good enough risk-reward ratio for me.
