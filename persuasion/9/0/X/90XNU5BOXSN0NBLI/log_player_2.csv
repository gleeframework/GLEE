**Explanation:**

* **The data is in Alice's favor:**  5 out of 5 products sold were high quality. This suggests a strong likelihood that the product being offered is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation adds weight:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying.  While not foolproof, it's a strong signal.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:**  A high-quality product gives a $100 profit, while a low-quality one results in a $100 loss. With the current information, the potential gain is significantly higher than the potential loss. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information presented and the assumption that Alice acts in her best interest (meaning she wants to maximize her sales).  In reality, there's always a chance of Alice being wrong or deliberately misleading."
