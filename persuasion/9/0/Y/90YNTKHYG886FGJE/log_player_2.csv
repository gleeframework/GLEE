Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. However, I must correct my previous message: the first product was actually low-quality, not high-quality. So, the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. But, considering the two consecutive low-quality products, the odds might be slightly worse than expected. If you're still interested, I'll sell this new product to you for $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. The fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't necessarily change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality, which remains 33.33%. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've had a streak of bad luck lately. If you're feeling optimistic, I'll sell this new product to you for $100.
