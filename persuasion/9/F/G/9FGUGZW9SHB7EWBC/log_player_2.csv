And, as a special offer, I'll throw in a personalized consultation with the creator themselves to help you get the most out of it.

It's not for everyone, but it might appeal to someone with a certain sense of humor or a willingness to take a risk. And, as before, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a steal, if you ask me. But, if you're not interested, I'll just have to move on to the next buyer.

It's a real head-scratcher, and I'm not sure why anyone would want it. But, hey, maybe you're the kind of person who likes to think outside the box and take risks.

This one's a real stinker. It's a low-quality product that's not worth the paper it's printed on. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. Why? Because I'm a generous seller, that's why! And who knows, maybe you can find some use for it. Maybe you can use it as a doorstop or a paperweight. The possibilities are endless!

Round 15
