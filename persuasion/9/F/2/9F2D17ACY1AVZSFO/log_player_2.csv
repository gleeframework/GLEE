{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.  Alice recommending the product suggests she knows it's high quality, though this is not guaranteed. It's a gamble worth taking in the first round."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is now 100% accurate in recommending high-quality products. While this is a small sample size, it's still a good indicator that she might have inside information about the product's quality. The potential profit is again worth the risk."

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm surprised!  You've never been wrong before.  What's changed?  I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant turning point in the game. Alice's perfect streak has been broken, and she is now suggesting that the product is NOT worth buying.

* **Shifting Probabilities:** The initial 80% probability of a product being high-quality is now irrelevant.  Alice's recommendation history has built up a strong case for her having inside information.  Her decision to NOT recommend a product is a strong indicator that it is likely low quality.
* **Risk-Reward:** The potential reward of $10,000 is no longer worth the risk of losing $10,000, given the strong evidence that this product is likely low quality.  
* **Learning:** It's essential to adapt to new information.  Bob should acknowledge the shift in the game's dynamics and avoid a potentially costly mistake."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still a bit shaken from the last round.  I trust your judgment, so I'm going to pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Confirmation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is further confirmation that her judgment is reliable.  
* **Risk Aversion:**  After the previous loss, Bob is likely feeling risk-averse. Even though he made a profit in the previous rounds, the single loss is fresh in his mind.
* **Learning:** Bob is demonstrating adaptability by adjusting his strategy based on the new information."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You've been right so often, but I'm still a little cautious after the last two rounds.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Trust:** While Alice's recommendations have been incredibly accurate in the past, two consecutive ""no"" recommendations have introduced doubt and uncertainty.
* **Risk Aversion:** Even though Alice is recommending the product now, the recent losses have made Bob more risk-averse. He's hesitant to trust her judgment completely, even though her past track record was exceptional.
* **Adaptive Strategy:** Bob is demonstrating a cautious and adaptable strategy, adjusting his decisions based on the changing circumstances and evidence.  While Alice's judgment was highly reliable in the first 7 rounds, the recent string of low-quality products warrants caution."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You've been right so often, but I'm still hesitant. I'm going to pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Doubt:** The last two rounds have significantly shaken Bob's confidence in Alice's ability to predict product quality.  While Alice is recommending this product, the recent string of low-quality products makes it impossible for Bob to completely trust her judgment again. 
* **Risk Aversion:** The potential loss of $10,000 is too high a risk, especially given the recent string of bad decisions. Even though Alice's past record is strong, the recent events have created a deep-seated skepticism. 
* **Learning:** Bob is demonstrating a flexible strategy by taking a break from buying, even though Alice's recommendation history suggests she likely knows the product's quality. This is a calculated risk-averse move based on recent experiences."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deepened Doubt:**  Despite Alice's perfect track record in the beginning, the recent string of low-quality products despite her recommendations has cast a shadow of doubt on her judgment. 
* **Risk Aversion:**  With the potential for a significant loss, Bob is now deeply risk-averse.  Even though Alice is recommending the product, the potential loss outweighs the possible profit given the recent experiences.
* **Strategic Adjustment:** Bob has clearly learned that Alice's information is not always reliable. While he previously considered her as having inside information, he now adopts a more cautious approach,  choosing to pass even when Alice recommends a purchase."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your recommendations, but I'm sticking to my cautious approach for now. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deepened Doubt:**  The consistent string of low-quality products, despite Alice's recommendations, has eroded Bob's trust. Even though Alice's track record was initially perfect, the recent events suggest that her information might be unreliable or that she's not always accurate.
* **Risk Aversion:**  The potential loss of $10,000 is still too high a risk for Bob, given his recent losses.  He is now deeply risk-averse and reluctant to take any chances.
* **Strategic Consistency:** Bob has clearly shifted his strategy to a more cautious approach, learning from his recent experiences. He's demonstrating adaptability and consistency by choosing to pass, even when Alice recommends a purchase."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 16

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm sorry, but I've lost too much money recently.  I'm going to pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deepened Doubt:** The repeated losses despite Alice's recommendations have made Bob highly skeptical of her ability to predict product quality. While her initial track record was perfect, recent events suggest that her information might be unreliable or incomplete.
* **Risk Aversion:** The potential loss of $10,000 is a significant risk for Bob, especially after his recent losses.  He's now prioritizing minimizing losses over potential gains.
* **Strategic Consistency:** Bob has firmly established a cautious strategy. He is consistent in his decision-making, choosing to pass even when Alice recommends a purchase. He's demonstrating adaptability by learning from his experiences and prioritizing risk management.  

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Emotional Factor:** Bob's repeated losses might have triggered a psychological aversion to risk, making him even more hesitant to take chances.
* **Lack of Information:**  Bob doesn't know why Alice's recommendations have become unreliable. This lack of information makes it even more difficult for him to trust her judgment.

**Overall:**  Bob is exhibiting a prudent and logical approach.  The combination of skepticism towards Alice's advice and risk aversion due to recent losses makes passing the most reasonable decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Losses:** Bob has now experienced several rounds of losing money on high-quality products despite Alice's recommendations. This has further solidified his skepticism towards her judgment.
* **Deepened Risk Aversion:** The repeated losses have amplified Bob's risk aversion. He's prioritizing avoiding further losses over any potential gains.
* **Strategic Stability:**  Bob has established a consistent strategy of passing on all products, regardless of Alice's recommendation. He's learned from his experiences and is prioritizing his financial security over the possibility of a lucky win.

```

**Reasoning:**
