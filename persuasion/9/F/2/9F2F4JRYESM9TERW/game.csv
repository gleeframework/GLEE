low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?

,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that I can get for $100, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $66.67 (33.33% chance of high quality * $300)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
