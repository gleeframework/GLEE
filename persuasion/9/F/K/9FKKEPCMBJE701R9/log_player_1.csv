I sold a high-quality product to my previous customer for $1,000,000. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product, the probability that the next product is also high-quality is now 80% * (1 + 1/19) = 81.05%. This means that you have an even higher chance of getting a high-quality product than my first customer. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000, which is still a great deal considering the increased probability of it being high-quality. What do you say?""}"
