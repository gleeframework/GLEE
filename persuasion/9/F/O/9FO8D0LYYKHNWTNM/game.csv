high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have any information to base my decision on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record so far, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. However, I'm a rational buyer and I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm likely to be offered a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and no high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous 3 buyers didn't take the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5, which is 0%. This is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of its quality. With a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can learn more about the distribution of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales of high-quality products so far is just a coincidence and the next one might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 10, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, since you don't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's not a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 11 out of 12 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards recommending low-quality products, which would be a bad deal for me. I'll pass on the product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't give me any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially betting on the probability of a high-quality product being available, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the product's quality after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the low success rate of previous buyers."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 13 buyers have all been recommended to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
