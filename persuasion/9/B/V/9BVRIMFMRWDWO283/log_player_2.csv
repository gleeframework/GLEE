**Explanation:**

* **No prior data:** Since there's no prior sales data, we have no information about the seller's actual behavior.  
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice knows the product quality, her recommendation doesn't change the inherent 80% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the risk ($0). 

This decision is based on the initial probability of a high-quality product and the potential for a significant gain. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm happy to buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which means she likely knows it's high-quality. Since she knows the value to us, this is a strong signal.
* **Positive Sales History:**  The previous buyer bought the product, and it was high-quality. This further supports the likelihood of the current product being good.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**Important Note:**  This decision assumes Alice is trustworthy and has no incentive to mislead us. In a real-world scenario, we'd need more information about Alice's track record and potential biases."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Sales statistics:** The statistics show that all 8 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Expected value:**  Even considering the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

Therefore, it makes logical sense to buy the product."
