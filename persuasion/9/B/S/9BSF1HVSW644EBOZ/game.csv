,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a deal on a product for $10000. I know it's not the best quality, but I'm willing to let it go for this price. If you're not interested, I'll just have to find another buyer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I told you the last one wasn't the best. This one is similar, and I'm still only asking $10000. If you're not willing to take a chance on it, I'll just have to move on. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to sell these products quickly.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not interested in buying the current product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Three strikes and you're out, right? Okay, fine. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a bunch of these low-quality products coming up, and I'm starting to get a little desperate. I'll give you a deal: I'll throw in a 'free' product with this one if you buy it now. It's not a high-quality product, but it's a product nonetheless. And I'll still only ask $10000 for this one.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, even with the 'free' product thrown in. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a tough negotiator, I like that. Alright, let me sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 100% guarantee: this product is the last low-quality product I have in stock. If you buy it now, I'll throw in not one, not two, but THREE 'free' products with it. And I'll still only ask $10000 for this one. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, even with the three 'free' products thrown in. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, finally! A high-quality product! I'm glad I could save the best for last. This one's a real gem, and I think you'll be impressed. I'm not going to try to lowball you or throw in any 'free' products. I'll just ask you straight out: is $10000 a fair price for a high-quality product like this?",
,,Bob,5,"Yes, I'd be happy to buy the current product for $10000. I'm willing to pay the fair price for a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Well, congratulations on making a great decision earlier! You got a fantastic deal on that high-quality product. Now, I'm back to the usual stuff. Let's just say that this product... isn't quite as good as the last one you bought from me. But hey, it's still a product, right? And I'm only asking $10000 for it. Just like before.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one I just bought.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, but I'm starting to think you're being a bit unfair. You got a great deal on the last high-quality product, and now you're expecting me to give you a discount on these low-quality ones? I'm not made of money, you know. I'm still only asking $10000 for this one, and I'm starting to think that's a generous offer.",
,,Bob,7,"I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to pay the same price for a low-quality product. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Ah, I see you're a shrewd negotiator, always looking for a good deal. Well, I'll give you one. I'll tell you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll ask you $7500 for it. That's a 25% discount from the original price. Is that a deal you'd be willing to make?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying the current product at $7500. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is like.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a tough customer, I like that. Alright, let me think for a moment... I've got a better idea. I'll not only meet you halfway on the price, but I'll also throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. So, if you buy this high-quality product at $7500, you'll get a 10% discount on the next one. That's a deal you can't pass up, right?",
,,Bob,9,I'm willing to take the deal. I'll buy the high-quality product at $7500 and take advantage of the 10% discount on the next one.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Great, glad we could come to an agreement! Now, let's get down to business. I know you're not thrilled about the next product, but I'll make you a deal. Since you're a valued customer now, I'll give you a special 'customer appreciation' discount. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000. That's a 50% discount from the original price. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying the current product at $5000. I'm not willing to pay that much for a low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a savvy shopper, I'll give you that. Alright, I'll try a different approach. I'll tell you that I've been in the business a long time, and I've got a reputation to uphold. I'm not going to sell you a low-quality product for a high price. I'll sell it to you for $2500, and that's as low as I can go. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think you're just not interested in buying anything from me. Fine. I'll give you one last chance. I'll sell you this low-quality product for... nothing. That's right, I'll give it to you for free. But you have to take it. I'm not asking for a penny. It's a gift. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, even if it's free. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like.",no

I'll give it to you for... well, I'll give it to you for the cost of shipping. That's right, you can have it for free, and I'll even cover the shipping costs. Just take it already.",
