**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 2/2 high-quality products sold, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product quality, recommends buying. This suggests that the current product is likely high quality.

**While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the evidence strongly suggests it's worth the risk.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are heavily in your favor:** Since 7 out of 7 products recommended by Alice have been high quality, it strongly suggests that she is reliably recommending only high-quality products. 
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice knows that a high-quality product will be sold, making her a profit. This further supports the likelihood of her offering a high-quality product.
* **No downside to buying:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, you lose only $100. But if it's high quality, you gain $100.

Therefore, the risk-reward ratio strongly favors buying the product."
