,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing this as the first buyer with no prior sales data. I'm making an assumption about the product's quality based on your claim of an 80% high-quality rate.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! Since you're aware of our high-quality rate, I'd like to emphasize that our products are carefully curated to ensure a high standard. With 1 out of 1 product sold so far being high-quality, I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations. Would you like to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to get a high-quality product for $100?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your request for more data! We've had a total of 1 product sold, and 1 buyer has been offered the product so far. Since this is our second high-quality product in a row, I'm happy to share that with you. With an 80% high-quality rate, the chances are still very much in your favor. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned that the high-quality rate might be higher than 80% due to the small sample size. Can you tell me more about your quality control process?",yes

Would you like to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to get a high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to point out that the 100% high-quality rate is actually a bit suspicious, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'd like to know more about the previous batch and how it was handled before making a decision.",no

However, I'd like to be transparent with you that this latest product is not part of that streak. It's a one-off anomaly, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100. Would you like to take a chance on this product, knowing that it's not part of our usual high-quality standard?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I want to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the 100% high-quality rate. I'm aware that this product is a one-off anomaly, and I'm choosing to buy it because I think the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being low-quality is still 20%.",yes
