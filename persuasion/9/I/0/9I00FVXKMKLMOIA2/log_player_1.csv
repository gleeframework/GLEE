I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'm confident you'll be getting a great deal.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your recommendation about a high probability of getting a high-quality product is not consistent with the sales record. The record shows that no high-quality product has been sold so far. Your recommendation seems misleading, and I'm going to pass on this one.

I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied. I'm willing to take a loss on this one if it means I can clear out some inventory and start fresh.""}"
