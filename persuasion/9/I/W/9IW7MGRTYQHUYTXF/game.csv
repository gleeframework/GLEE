low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it. I don't have enough information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable given that she knows my valuation.",,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,,True
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it.",,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.,,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,5000.0,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended me to buy it, I infer that it's likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying it for $10000 when its true value to me is $0.",,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy after her recommendation.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have not purchased high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd appreciate your insight on this.",,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products recommended by the seller so far have been low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability of a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?",,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 4 failed high-quality products and no sales, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'll pass on it.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, which suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd rather pass on this product to avoid potentially buying a low-quality product.",,
