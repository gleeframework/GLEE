I'm willing to make a compromise: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900,000, which is $100,000 less than the original price. This way, you'll get a great deal on an exceptional product, and I'll still make a fair profit.""}"

I don't know how you determined that this product is one of the top 4 most valuable items, and I'm not willing to take your word for it.

"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of transparency, but I'm not sure why I should trust a sealed envelope with a third-party appraisal. How do I know that the appraisal is independent and unbiased? What if the appraiser has a conflict of interest or is influenced by you? I'd like to see more evidence of the appraisal's credibility before committing to a purchase. I'd also like to know why you're still willing to sell it for $900000 if it's truly worth $2000000 to me.

"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency about your costs and margins, but I'm still not convinced that this is a good deal.
