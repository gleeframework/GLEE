,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior data to go by. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. Given the 2/3 chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. The fact that Alice recommends it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that others have somehow missed."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which might suggest a low-quality product is more likely. However, I'm willing to take the chance and buy it for the price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the previous 5 buyers. With 0 high-quality products sold, I'm worried that the probability might be low."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own analysis rather than your recommendation.

I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation."
