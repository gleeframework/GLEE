,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you appreciated the transparency! This next product is also not as valuable as the first one, and I'm not offering a discount on it. However, I want to assure you that it's a unique opportunity to get a product at a price that's lower than its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the same price as the first product. Think of it as a chance to get a 'free' product, since you already got a high-quality one for the same price.",

I want to make it clear that this product is not worth anything to you, and I'm not expecting you to pay for it. However, I'm willing to let you have it for the low price of $80.
