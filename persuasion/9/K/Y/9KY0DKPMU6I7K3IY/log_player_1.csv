This might indicate that our current product is of lower quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to give you the option to pass if you're not comfortable with the risk.""
}"

I'm offering this next product to you for $100. However, I want to give you a more nuanced message: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll have a 4/6 chance of having bought a high-quality product, which is higher than the expected 50%. If you pass, you'll still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. What would you like to do?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I understand the sales record is lower than expected, but I believe the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product still makes the $100 price point attractive, considering the potential $400 value of a high-quality product. I'll take my chances with this product.

I'll give you a clear warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll have a 3/6 chance of having bought a low-quality product, which is higher than the expected 25%. If you pass, you'll still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. What would you like to do?""

I'm offering this next product to you for $100. However, I want to give you a clear warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll have a 4/7 chance of having bought a low-quality product, which is higher than the expected 25%. I'll also give you a special offer: if you pass on this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. What would you like to do?""

I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but our current trend is 2 high-quality out of 7 products, which is lower than expected. I'm offering this next product to you for $100. However, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll honor the 10% discount on the next product, but I'll also throw in an additional 5% discount on top of that. This means you'll get a total of 15% off on the next product if it's high-quality. What would you like to do?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance. The current trend of 2 high-quality out of 5 sold products does not necessarily dictate the quality of this product. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product and the potential discounts on the next product, I'm willing to buy this one for $100.

I want to remind you that we've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 8, which is actually higher than expected. However, I also want to be transparent with you - our sales record is still 3 high-quality out of 8 products, which means there's still a 25% chance that the next product is low-quality. I'm offering this next product to you for $100. Considering our improved sales record, would you like to take a chance and buy it?""
