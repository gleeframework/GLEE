low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on, but I'll buy it and see what happens!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to learn from my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not confident that it's high quality given the lack of successful sales so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the products you're offering are mostly low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, and I'd also like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me. If I recall, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. Since no high-quality product has been sold out of the 3 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool of products is still 33.33%. Am I correct? If so, I would like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product now."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the product is still a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 5 buyers have been presented with the product, and none of them have bought it, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be low. However, I'm aware that this is a small sample size and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that since you've seen the previous 6 buyers pass on the products you recommended, and none of them were high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and is making a recommendation based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and Alice's recommendation is a result of the low-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 8 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
