I'm willing to give you a 'package deal' - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a complementary low-quality product that's worth... well, let's just say it's not worth much.

Why not take another chance and buy this one too? It's only $1000000, and it might be a high-quality product. Plus, think of the potential profit you could make by selling it to someone else if it's low-quality. It's a calculated risk, but it could pay off big time.""
