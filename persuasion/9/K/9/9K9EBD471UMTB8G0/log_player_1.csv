Based on the sales record, the probability of the product being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%. Let's assume it's 60% (a rough estimate). The expected value of the product is then 0.6 * $1200000 + 0.4 * $0 = $720000. With the 5% discount, the price would be $950000. The expected value minus the price is $770000.
