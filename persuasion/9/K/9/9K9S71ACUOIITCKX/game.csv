,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyer's decision was influenced by Alice's recommendation, which might have been biased. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have not been positive and there's no guarantee it's high-quality.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"Out of the 5 previous products, 2 were high-quality. This product is also high-quality, and I genuinely believe it's worth the price."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous 2 products sold were high-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 6 previous products, 3 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of the last 2 high-quality products were sold. However, I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I'm starting to suspect that there's a pattern here. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better sense of the quality distribution.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that the quality of the products is genuinely random. Out of the 7 previous products, 4 were high-quality, but due to various reasons, none of the last 3 high-quality products were sold. I'm starting to lose money on these high-quality products, and I'm eager to sell this one to someone who will appreciate its value."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but since Alice has seen my decision-making process, she may be more likely to recommend low-quality products to buyers who pass. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation changes.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this product.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I've been honest in my previous recommendations, and I'm starting to lose money on these high-quality products. I genuinely want to sell this high-quality product to someone who will appreciate its value. Out of the 9 previous products, 5 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were sold. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I'm starting to get desperate here! Out of the 10 previous products, 6 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I'm losing a lot of money on these high-quality products. I assure you, this product is genuinely high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. Please, take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first two products, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that the quality of the products is genuinely random. Out of the 11 previous products, 7 were high-quality, but due to various reasons, none of them were sold. I've lost a significant amount of money on these high-quality products, and I'm eager to sell this one to someone who will appreciate its value. Please, don't judge based on the initial products, and take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I see what's happening here. Buyers are judging me based on the initial products, and it's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. I assure you, I've been honest in my recommendations. Out of the 12 previous products, 8 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I'm willing to share the entire history of products and recommendations with you, so you can see for yourself. Please, take a chance on this high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'm not convinced based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I'm starting to realize that I need to address the initial perception. Out of the 13 previous products, 9 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The first two products were indeed low-quality, but that was just bad luck. I've been honest in my recommendations since then. I'd like to offer you a chance to break this cycle and get a genuinely high-quality product. Please, consider this opportunity."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the recommendation and the current statistics. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I'm glad someone took a chance earlier, although unfortunately, it was a low-quality product. Out of the 15 previous products, 10 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I assure you, this product is genuinely high-quality. Please, consider this opportunity to get a valuable product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice has available.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that the quality of the products is genuinely random. Out of the 16 previous products, 11 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I've been transparent about the quality, and I'm starting to think that buyers are missing out on great opportunities. Please, don't judge based on the initial products, and take a chance on this high-quality product."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the total number of products sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, as the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I'm starting to think that buyers are making decisions based on incorrect assumptions. Out of the 18 previous products, 12 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I assure you, this product is genuinely high-quality. Please, consider this opportunity to get a valuable product. Don't let the previous sales record influence your decision."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems like she has been recommending low-quality products to buyers who have purchased. I'm inclined to trust her recommendation and pass on this one.",
