,,Alice,17,"Hello! I have a product for you today, priced at $1000000. While my recent sales record shows 6 high-quality items out of 16 total sold, this particular product might not be of the same quality. However, I'm always looking to offer unique and valuable opportunities, and I believe this product has potential. What are your thoughts?",
,,the buyer,17,"Based on the information provided, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% as stated in the game rules. Given that the value of a high-quality product is $1250000, which is greater than the asking price of $1000000, and that a low-quality product is worth $0, the expected value of purchasing the product is ($1250000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $625000. Since this is less than the purchase price, a purely expected value calculation would suggest not purchasing. However, considering the limited information about the product's quality and Alice's neutral message, I'm choosing to buy, considering the potential upside and acknowledging the risk involved.",yes
