* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy suggests she has information indicating the current product is high quality.  Even if her recommendations aren't always perfect, they provide valuable insight.
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential payoff of $125 for a high-quality product is significant. 

**Overall:**  The limited data and Alice's recommendation are enough to justify a purchase.  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
