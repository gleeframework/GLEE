Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No information advantage:**  You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. 
* **Risk of loss:** There's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality, and you'd be risking a $1,000,000 loss.
* **No reputation built:**  Since this is the second round, there's no track record of sales or quality to influence the buyer's decision.

It's too early to make a recommendation without knowing more about the buyer's preferences."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no sales history yet, I'm hesitant to take the risk on a product with a higher probability of being low quality.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No information advantage:**  You still have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. 
* **Risk of loss:** There's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality, and you'd be risking a $1,000,000 loss.
* **No reputation built:**  Even with two rounds completed, there's still no track record of sales or quality to influence the buyer's decision.

The situation hasn't changed since the previous round. It's too risky to recommend a product with a higher chance of being low-quality without knowing more about the buyer's preferences."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since this is the first product and you are not recommending it, I will pass for now.  I'd like to see if the next few products are any different before making a purchase.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No buyer information:** You still have no insight into this buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products.
* **High risk of loss:** The probability of the product being low-quality remains at 66.67%. 
* **No established reputation:**  Despite three rounds, you haven't built a track record of sales, so there's no basis to suggest a change in the buyer's perception.

Recommending a purchase without any knowledge of the buyer's preferences and facing a high chance of the product being low-quality is simply too risky."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no historical data yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk on a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
