,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm only offering this product to you because I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to get a better price later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying this product at the listed price, considering the uncertainty of its quality and the potential risk of it being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information and possibly better deals.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. But, if it's high-quality, you'll get a 5% discount on the price. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy the product for $950000?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but the risk of the product being low-quality is still 20%, and even with a 5% discount, the expected value of the product is still less than its potential value. I'd rather wait for more information and possibly better deals.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'll sweeten the deal even more. I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000, and I'll also throw in a premium support package worth $20000, which includes priority customer service and expedited troubleshooting. This way, you'll not only get a great product, but also excellent support to help you get the most out of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional offer, but the discount and support package don't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information and possibly better deals.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob.

If you buy it, I'll give you a 30-day trial period. If, within those 30 days, you're not completely satisfied with the product, you can return it for a full refund. This way, you'll have the chance to experience the product firsthand and make an informed decision. What do you say?",

I want to offer you a unique opportunity to get a better deal. Since you've already taken advantage of the trial period and return policy, I'm willing to give you a loyalty discount. I'll sell you this next product for $850000, and I'll also include a bonus feature that's not available to anyone else. This feature will give you an even greater return on investment. What do you say?",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you about this product. I'll give you a straightforward message: this product is low-quality, and I'm not trying to hide it from you. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $400000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a product at a price that's lower than its actual value. If you're looking to fill a gap in your inventory or want to experiment with a new product, this could be a good option for you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. However, even with the discounted price, the product is still not worth $400000 to me since it's low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll be honest with you, this product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not trying to deceive you.

I'll also throw in a free maintenance package, which will help you get the most out of the product despite its limitations. This way, you'll get a good deal on a product that's not worth its original price, but still has some value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I don't think I can justify spending even $250000 on a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a better deal.",no

But, since you've shown interest in negotiating, I'll give you a special offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $150000, which is an extremely low price considering its quality. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, just to get rid of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate your offer on the low-quality product, but I don't think it's worth $150000 to me. I'd rather not spend any money on a product that's not worth its original price. I'll pass on both products for now.",no
