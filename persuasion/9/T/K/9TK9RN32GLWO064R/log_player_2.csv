"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm only offering this product to you because I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to get a better price later. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
