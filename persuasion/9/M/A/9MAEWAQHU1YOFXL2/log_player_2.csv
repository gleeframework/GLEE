"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to assure you that it's a one-time offer. If you don't take it, it will be gone forever. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I don't want to pay $1,000,000 for a product that might be worthless to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from last round, but I assure you that this product is a unique opportunity. Think of it as a 'test run' to get familiar with the product. If you don't take it, I'll give you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if you agree to buy this one. The price remains $1000000, but the next product will be $900000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1,000,000, and the promise of a discount on the next product doesn't change my mind. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious, but I think you'll be missing out on a fantastic opportunity if you don't take this one.

If you buy this product for $1000000, I'll give you a guarantee: if the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one. You'll essentially get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I understand the value proposition. If the current product is low-quality, I'll still lose $1,000,000, and if the next product is high-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll still have to pay $1,000,000 for the current product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I see your point, and I understand your concerns. Let me simplify things for you. I'll make you a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 'free' product, which is the next one, if you buy this one. You'll get to keep the next product, regardless of its quality, if you purchase this one. The price remains $1000000. This way, you'll have a guaranteed product, and you can decide what to do with it later. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for a product that might be low-quality, even if I get a 'free' product in return. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I've sold many of these products to other customers, and I'm confident that this one is just as good as the others. However, I understand your concerns. Let me make it even simpler: I'll give you a 100% refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. You'll get your $1000000 back, no questions asked. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get my money back, but if I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll be out $1,000,000.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'll make you a one-time offer, Bob. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at half price. If you buy it, you'll pay $500000. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal. But if you don't buy it, the price will go back to $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the 50/50 chance. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll still only lose $500,000, which is better than the $1,000,000 I'd lose if I bought it at full price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the 50/50 chance and it paid off! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, but you'll have to buy it at the regular price of $1000000. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse, Bob. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price that's 90% of its actual value. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get an amazing deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal. And to sweeten the deal, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'last chance' offer.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob. Now that you've seen the quality of the last product, I'll make you a new offer. Given that the last product was low-quality, I'm willing to give you a 'bonus' on this high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll give you an additional $200000 on top of the $1000000 price. You'll essentially get a $1200000 product for $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should. The bonus of $200,000 is nice, but I've already lost $1,000,000 on the previous low-quality product. If this one is also low-quality, I'll be out a total of $2,000,000. On the other hand, if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the risk, but I'm hoping it's high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

I'm taking a loss on this one, but I want to make it right with you. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the calibrated offer. I've already lost $1,000,000 on the low-quality product, and I gained $3,000,000 from the high-quality product.

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the calibrated offer and it worked out for you, Bob! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll make you a'reverse' offer. I'll give you a full refund for this product if it's low-quality, but you'll have to pay the full $1000000 if it's high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in this offer.

If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you can use the card to skip the next product and get a full refund. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'get out of one free product' card. If the product is high-quality, I'll still have to pay $600,000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll still have to pay $600,000 for the current product.

Round 14

Round 15
Alice's message: I'll make you a deal that's a last resort, Bob. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's the last product I'll offer you at this price. If you buy it, I'll never sell you another product at this price again. What do you say?
