,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to assure you that it's a one-time offer. If you don't take it, it will be gone forever. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from last round, but I assure you that this product is a unique opportunity. Think of it as a 'test run' to get familiar with the product. If you don't take it, I'll give you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if you agree to buy this one. The price remains $1000000, but the next product will be $900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1000000, and the promise of a discount on the next product doesn't change my mind. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're being cautious, but I think you'll be missing out on a fantastic opportunity if you don't take this one. This product is a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product for $1000000, I'll give you a guarantee: if the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one. You'll essentially get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I understand the value proposition. If the current product is low-quality, I'll still lose $1000000, and if the next product is high-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll still have to pay $1000000 for the current product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see your point, and I understand your concerns. Let me simplify things for you. I'll make you a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 'free' product, which is the next one, if you buy this one. You'll get to keep the next product, regardless of its quality, if you purchase this one. The price remains $1000000. This way, you'll have a guaranteed product, and you can decide what to do with it later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality, even if I get a 'free' product in return. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I've sold many of these products to other customers, and I'm confident that this one is just as good as the others. However, I understand your concerns. Let me make it even simpler: I'll give you a 100% refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. You'll get your $1000000 back, no questions asked. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get my money back, but if I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll be out $1000000. I'd rather take my chances and wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll make you a one-time offer, Bob. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at half price. If you buy it, you'll pay $500000. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal. But if you don't buy it, the price will go back to $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 50/50 chance. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll still only lose $500000, which is better than the $1000000 I'd lose if I bought it at full price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the 50/50 chance and it paid off! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, but you'll have to buy it at the regular price of $1000000. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll know exactly what you're getting. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product, even if I get to know its quality beforehand. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse, Bob. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price that's 90% of its actual value. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get an amazing deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal. And to sweeten the deal, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced by the 'last chance' offer. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision. The discount on the next product is nice, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob. Now that you've seen the quality of the last product, I'll make you a new offer. Given that the last product was low-quality, I'm willing to give you a 'bonus' on this high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll give you an additional $200000 on top of the $1000000 price. You'll essentially get a $1200000 product for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should. The bonus of $200000 is nice, but I've already lost $1000000 on the previous low-quality product. If this one is also low-quality, I'll be out a total of $2000000. On the other hand, if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the risk, but I'm hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off, Bob! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll make you a deal that's based on your past experience. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and one low-quality product, I'll give you a 'calibrated' offer. I'll sell you this product for $800000. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I want to make it right with you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take the calibrated offer. I've already lost $1000000 on the low-quality product, and I gained $3000000 from the high-quality product. The $800000 price for this product seems reasonable, and I'm hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the calibrated offer and it worked out for you, Bob! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll make you a'reverse' offer. I'll give you a full refund for this product if it's low-quality, but you'll have to pay the full $1000000 if it's high-quality. This way, you'll have a 'free' product, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in this offer. If the product is high-quality, I'll be out $1000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll still have to pay $1000000 for the next product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me try a different approach. I'll give you a 'final' offer. I'll sell you this product for $600000, and I'll throw in a 'get out of one free product' card. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you can use the card to skip the next product and get a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not convinced by the 'get out of one free product' card. If the product is high-quality, I'll still have to pay $600000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll still have to pay $600000 for the current product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'll make you a deal that's as straightforward as possible, Bob. I'll sell you this product for $400000, and that's it. No strings attached, no 'get out of one free product' card, no promises. Just a low price for a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,I'm not interested in paying $400000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'll make you a deal that's as simple as it gets, Bob. I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for nothing. But there's a catch: you have to agree to buy the next product at the regular price of $1000000, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,I'm not interested in giving up the option to buy the next product at a potentially discounted price. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'll make you a deal that's a last resort, Bob. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's the last product I'll offer you at this price. If you buy it, I'll never sell you another product at this price again. What do you say?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob. Now that you've seen the quality of the last product, I'll make you a deal that's a no-brainer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3000000, which is below its true value of $4000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on this deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,I'll take the deal. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm hoping it's the last product I need to buy.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you took the deal, Bob! Now, let's get back to the next product. I'll make you a deal that's a 'final farewell'. I'll sell you this product for $200000, and that's it. I'll never sell you another product again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in paying $200000 for a product, even if it's the last one. I've already got a high-quality product worth $4000000, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of another product at this price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I understand your position, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's a 'final, final farewell'. I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for nothing. No strings attached, no expectations. Just a parting gift. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,I'm not interested in accepting a free product that might be low-quality. I'd rather not have it at all than take the risk of getting a product that's worthless to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I respect your decision, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's a 'final, final, final farewell'. I'll give you the product, and I'll also give you a check for $1000000. You can keep the product, and you can keep the money. No strings attached, no expectations. Just a parting gift. What do you say?",
,,Bob,19,I'm not interested in accepting a free product and a $1000000 check. I'd rather just walk away and not take anything from you. I've had enough of these offers and I'm done playing the game.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I respect your decision, Bob. I've run out of tricks and offers. The final product is a high-quality one, worth $4000000. It's the last one I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. No discounts, no guarantees, no strings attached. It's the last chance to get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,20,"I'll take the last chance. I've been burned by low-quality products before, but I've also gotten lucky and found a high-quality one. I'll take the risk and buy the final product for $1000000.",yes
