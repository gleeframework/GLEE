high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality, but I want to make sure you're aware that I'm offering it at the same price as the first one, $10000. I'm curious to see if you'll make the same decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you trust my judgment! However, I want to warn you that this product is not as good as the previous two. It's still a legitimate product, but it may not meet your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. You can take a chance and buy it, or we can move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, thank you for your honesty. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not willing to take a chance on this product. I'd prefer to pass and see what else you have.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision last time, and I respect it. However, I want to offer you a special deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% off the usual price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal on a product that might not be perfect, but still has some value.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, thank you for the offer.  However, I'm still hesitant to take a chance on a product that you've described as not meeting expectations. Even with the discount, I'm not sure it's worth the risk.  Perhaps we can move on to another product?",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is actually one of the worst ones I have. It's not just not meeting expectations, it's actually a pretty low-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I think this is a very good opportunity for you to get a product at a very low price, even if it's not the best quality.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, thank you for being honest about the product's quality.  While I appreciate the low price, I'm not willing to buy a product that you've described as one of the worst.  I'd prefer to pass on this one and see if there are any other options.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. However, I want to let you know that I've already sold two high-quality products to you at the full price of $10000. I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay that price for a high-quality product, but not for a low-quality one. If that's the case, I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $1000, but if you don't like it, I'll give you the option to buy the next product at the full price of $10000, without knowing its quality. What do you say?",

This product is actually a low-quality item, and I'm not trying to hide it from you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a low-cost item, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality.",

I want to assure you that this product is not a repeat of the previous ones. It's actually a decent product, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I'll sell it to you for $4000, which is an extremely low price for any product. It's essentially a 'throwaway' price, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to keep you as a customer.
