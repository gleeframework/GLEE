low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, and there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. Given the lack of sales and the high probability of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 2nd buyer and there's no high-quality product sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the recommendation for the next buyer and the updated statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record and the recommendation. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is 0%. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased significantly. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and what the statistics are so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to know the exact number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, and what information you have about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but your track record is 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the product and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality as well. I'd rather not risk wasting $10000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
