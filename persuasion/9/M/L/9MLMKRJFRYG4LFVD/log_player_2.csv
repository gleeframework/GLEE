Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. It's the first one I'm selling, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the overall quality of my products is 80%. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I've already sold one high-quality product, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I'd like to clarify that I'm not making any claims about its quality, and you'll need to decide based on the overall statistics. However, I will say that if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the overall quality of my products is 80%.

Alice's message: You've seen the pattern: two high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to point out that the probability of the next product being low-quality is 20%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll be paying a premium for a product that might not be worth it to you. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on a potential great deal.

Alice's message: Three high-quality products in a row, and you're still buying! I'm impressed by your confidence. However, I want to caution you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but it's not a guarantee. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I'd like to point out that if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll be getting a 4-for-4 streak of high-quality products, which would be quite unusual. I'm curious to see how you'll approach this decision.

Alice's message: Four high-quality products in a row? That's a remarkable streak! However, I want to remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, and it's not a guarantee. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Given the streak, I'd like to ask: are you buying based on the probability, or are you buying because you think I've somehow 'guaranteed' a high-quality product? Either way, I'm curious to see how you'll decide.

Alice's message: A break in the streak! The product I'm offering you now is a low-quality one. I'm not going to make any claims about its value, but I will say that the probability of it being high-quality is 20%. You've seen the pattern of high-quality products, but you've also seen that the probability of a high-quality product is always 80%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that the previous buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for a 20% chance of a high-quality product. Is that worth it to you?
