high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. It's the first one I'm selling, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the overall quality of my products is 80%. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the assumption that the product is indeed high-quality, as you've stated. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, but I'd like to acknowledge that there's a 20% chance it might not be worth $1000000 to me.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've already sold one high-quality product, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I'd like to clarify that I'm not making any claims about its quality, and you'll need to decide based on the overall statistics. However, I will say that if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the overall quality of my products is 80%.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm hoping to get a good deal. I'm not relying on your recommendation, and I'm aware that the quality is uncertain.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen the pattern: two high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to point out that the probability of the next product being low-quality is 20%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll be paying a premium for a product that might not be worth it to you. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on a potential great deal.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. Given the pattern, I'm willing to bet that it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row, and you're still buying! I'm impressed by your confidence. However, I want to caution you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but it's not a guarantee. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I'd like to point out that if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll be getting a 4-for-4 streak of high-quality products, which would be quite unusual. I'm curious to see how you'll approach this decision.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm aware of the low probability of four high-quality products in a row, but I'm also aware of the 80% chance of this product being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four high-quality products in a row? That's a remarkable streak! However, I want to remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, and it's not a guarantee. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Given the streak, I'd like to ask: are you buying based on the probability, or are you buying because you think I've somehow 'guaranteed' a high-quality product? Either way, I'm curious to see how you'll decide.",
,,the buyer,5,I'm buying based on the probability. I understand that the streak is just a coincidence and that each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to take that risk and pay $1000000 for the chance to potentially get a high-quality product worth $4000000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"A break in the streak! The product I'm offering you now is a low-quality one. I'm not going to make any claims about its value, but I will say that the probability of it being high-quality is 20%. You've seen the pattern of high-quality products, but you've also seen that the probability of a high-quality product is always 80%. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that the previous buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for a 20% chance of a high-quality product. Is that worth it to you?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 20% chance of a high-quality product, especially after seeing that the previous buyer was willing to pay the same amount for the same probability. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"A new buyer has arrived! You've seen the pattern of high-quality products, and you've also seen that one buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for a 20% chance of a high-quality product. Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. You have the opportunity to get a product that's worth at least $1000000, and potentially more. I'm not making any claims about its value, but I am saying that it's a high-quality product. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality, based on the 5 high-quality products sold out of 5 attempts.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're right to question the probability. With 5 high-quality products sold out of 8 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 62.5% (5/8). I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that this is a low-quality product, and you'll be paying the full price for it. However, if you buy it, you'll have a better understanding of the true probability of the next product being high-quality, which is 62.5%.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a better understanding of the true probability. I'll pay the $1000000, but I'm not expecting to get much value out of it since it's a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've bought the low-quality product and now you know the true probability is 62.5%. With this new information, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 62.5% as well. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Given the new probability, I'd like to ask: are you willing to pay the same price for a product with a 62.5% chance of being high-quality, or are you looking for a better deal?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the new probability of 62.5%, I'd expect to pay around 1.6 million to be indifferent, considering the value of a high-quality product is 4 million. I'm not willing to pay the full 1 million for a product with only a 62.5% chance of being high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a savvy buyer! You've done your math and you're not willing to pay the full price for a product with a 62.5% chance of being high-quality. I'll give you a nod of respect for that. Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. Keep in mind that you've already seen the true probability of 62.5%, and you know that this product is definitely not high-quality. I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on a low-quality product, or if you'll wait for a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,11,"You're holding out for a better opportunity. I respect that. With 7 high-quality products sold out of 11 attempts, and 2 low-quality products sold out of 11 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 86.7% (7/11).
