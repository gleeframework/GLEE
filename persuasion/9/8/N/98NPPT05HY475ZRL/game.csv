,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm the first one, and I don't have any prior information to go on."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous recommendations were to buy, which makes me suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the first buyer didn't buy and there are no high-quality products sold yet. I'm not convinced this is a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products you have left in stock before I make my decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I could potentially get a great deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics, before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low-quality. If I were to buy it, I'd be overpaying by $2000000. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, it's likely that the products offered so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or until the probability of a high-quality product increases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. You've recommended 3 products to other buyers, and none of them were high-quality. Does this suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if I can get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%. I don't have enough information to justify a purchase at $1000000."
