,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only buying because I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go off of. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and set a good precedent for future buyers."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold. I'd like to make an informed decision based on more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that Alice recommended it, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold given that Alice recommended it, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you recommended me to buy it, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product, and I'd like you to reveal the quality of the product after I pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far (1/2 = 50%), I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'd rather not take the chance of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the recommendation was based on the previous buyers' decisions, not on any information about the product itself."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice recommends it, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $1000000. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation is still in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first two buyers were able to get high-quality products, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the limited data so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. This is lower than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product and would like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the low success rate so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, and only 1 out of those 2 was high-quality, I'm skeptical about the true quality of the product. I'd rather not take the risk and let Alice keep the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% based on the previous sales record. I'm not relying on your recommendation."
