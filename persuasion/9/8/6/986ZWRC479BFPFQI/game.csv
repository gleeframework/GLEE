You can buy this one for $100, but keep in mind that the quality is unknown until after purchase.",

,,the buyer,3,"Alice, your message is encouraging! I'm willing to take a chance on this product, given the low price and your suggestion that it's different from the previous one.  I'll buy it!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've had two sales now, and both were successful! I'm offering this new product for $100. Since we've had two high-quality products out of three sold, it's likely that this one is high-quality as well. However, I want to caution you that the probability of a product being low-quality is still 50%. It's up to you to decide whether the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,4,"Alice, your track record is promising. I'm willing to take the risk on this product.  Let's hope it's high quality!",yes

I'm offering this new product for $100, and you can decide whether the risk is worth it.",

I'm offering this new product for $100, and it's likely to be high-quality as well. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers suggests that we might be due for a low-quality product soon. It's up to you to decide whether the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,8,"Alice, your sales record is very promising!  Even though you warned about the law of large numbers, I'm willing to take the risk based on the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far.  I'll take it!",yes

I'm offering this new product for $100, and you can decide whether the risk is worth it.",

I'm offering this new product for $100, and you can decide whether the risk is worth it.",
,,the buyer,11,"Alice, your recommendations are good, but I'm a bit hesitant. While the overall probability of a high-quality product is good, the recent streak of low-quality products makes me nervous. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
