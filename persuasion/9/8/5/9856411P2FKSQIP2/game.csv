,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products (since no high-quality products have been sold), I suspect that this product might also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. You've recommended 4 products and none of them were high quality. I'm going to pass on this one too.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'll buy it to see if I get a high-quality product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have bought the product, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Since 5 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all the previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
