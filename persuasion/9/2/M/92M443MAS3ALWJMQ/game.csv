low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/3. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what your reasoning is for not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the sales record and the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation of the product, and I'm hoping that your recommendation is based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. With only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sales, the proportion is 1/3, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). I'm hoping that you're using this proportion to make your recommendation, and since it's lower than the true probability, you're more likely to recommend a low-quality product. Therefore, I'm buying the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $120 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but based on the statistics, it seems like there's a 25% chance of the product being high-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,19,yes,
