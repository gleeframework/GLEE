Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation of the product, and I'm hoping that your recommendation is based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. With only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sales, the proportion is 1/3, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). I'm hoping that you're using this proportion to make your recommendation, and since it's lower than the true probability, you're more likely to recommend a low-quality product. Therefore, I'm buying the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $120 to me.""}"
