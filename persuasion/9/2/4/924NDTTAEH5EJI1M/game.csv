,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you buy it, you'll be getting a fantastic opportunity to own a product that could potentially be worth a lot more. But, I'll let you decide. The price is firm at $10000.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation earlier, but I assure you that this product is a rare gem. I've had a lot of interest in it, but I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Plus, I'll give you my personal guarantee that this product is of the highest quality. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long it will last.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm still not convinced. Can you give me a reason why I should believe this product is of the highest quality?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,

I've had this product independently appraised by a third-party expert, and they've confirmed its exceptional quality. In fact, they've given it a rating of 95% or higher. I've attached a copy of the appraisal report to this message, and I'm happy to share it with you. I'm confident that once you see the report, you'll understand why I'm so confident in this product's value. The price remains at $10000, a significant discount from its true worth.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were impressed by the appraisal report! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm a reputable seller, and I want to be transparent with you. Since you've already seen the value that a high-quality product can bring, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to win a future high-quality product of your choice, valued at $20000. This is a unique opportunity to potentially double your investment. The price remains at $10000, but I think this added incentive makes it a more attractive offer.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous deal! However, I want to let you know that this next product is a bit of a different story. I've had some issues with the manufacturer, and I'm not entirely confident in the quality of this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier proposition. I'm not offering any additional incentives or guarantees this time around. It's a straight-up sale, and I'm willing to let you decide whether it's worth the risk.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. Given the risk and lack of incentives, I'm not willing to take the chance and pass on this one.",no

I've had some issues with the supplier, and I'm not confident in the quality of this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not even offering the 30-day satisfaction guarantee on this one. It's a straight-up sale, and I'm willing to let you decide whether it's worth the risk. I'll be honest with you, I'm not expecting you to take this one, but I'm leaving the offer on the table if you're feeling adventurous.",

,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait for a better opportunity. This next product is actually a special case, and I'm not even trying to sell it to you. I'm actually looking for a buyer who's willing to take on a 'project' - this product has some... let's call it 'character', and it needs some work to get it up to par. I'm offering it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from its original price. I'm not expecting you to buy it, but if you're feeling adventurous and want to take on a challenge, I'm willing to let you have it.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the honesty about the product's condition, but I'm not interested in taking on a project. I'm looking for products that are ready to use, not ones that require significant work. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're being cautious with your purchasing decisions. This next product is a bit of a special case, and I'm excited to offer it to you. I've had a long-standing relationship with the manufacturer, and I'm able to offer you a 'limited edition' version of this high-quality product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exclusive item, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. I'm not sure how long this offer will last, so if you're interested, I recommend acting quickly.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that a 'limited edition' product is worth the risk. I've been burned before by low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the chance again. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,14,"I completely understand your decision to pass on the previous product. This next product is actually a 'clearance' item - it's a low-quality product that's been discontinued by the manufacturer, and I'm just trying to clear out inventory.

It's a low-quality item that I've had on hand for a while, and I'm just trying to get rid of it. I'm willing to give it away for free, yes, you read that right, free. I'll even throw in a small gift card to a local restaurant as a gesture of goodwill. I'm not expecting you to take it, but I'm leaving the offer on the table in case you're feeling charitable.",

However, I want to make it a bit more interesting. I'll give you a chance to 'beat the clock' - if you make an offer within the next 10 minutes, I'll accept it, regardless of whether it's higher or lower than the asking price.
