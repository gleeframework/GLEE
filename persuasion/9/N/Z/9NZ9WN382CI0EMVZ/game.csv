,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm hesitant to purchase without more information. The current sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, but this is based on only one sale.  With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'd prefer to pass on this opportunity.  Perhaps if more buyers purchase and the success rate stays high, I'll reconsider."
