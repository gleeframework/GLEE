,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll give you a unique serial number that will guarantee you get a high-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but given the risk, I choose to pass on this product. Looking forward to potentially getting a high-quality item next round with your special guarantee.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. This product is also low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. If you buy it, I'll give you another unique serial number that will guarantee you get a high-quality product in the next round. However, if you buy this one and the next one is high-quality, I'll throw in a third round's product of your choice, absolutely free.

This round's product is also low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'll give you another unique serial number that will guarantee you get a high-quality product in the next round. But here's the twist: if you buy this one and the next one is high-quality, I'll not only give you a third round's product for free, but I'll also reveal the quality of the first two products you passed on. This way, you'll know exactly what you missed out on, and you can make a more informed decision for future purchases.",
,,Bob,3,"While your offer sounds tempting with the assurance of a high-quality product in the next round and the potential insight into the products I passed on, I still prefer to maintain my strategy of assessing each product independently. Your commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction is commendable, and I look forward to the possibility of receiving information about the products I've already seen.
