Alice's message: I understand your point, and I appreciate your honesty. It's true that the first product being high-quality has given me a good start, but I want to assure you that each product is still an independent event. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, regardless of the previous sales. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great value.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking a chance! I understand your concern about the discrepancy between the observed proportion of high-quality products and the expected probability. I'd like to clarify that the probability of a product being high-quality is based on the underlying distribution of product qualities, which is unknown to us. The observed proportion of high-quality products is simply a sample of this distribution. While it's possible that the observed proportion is different from the true probability, it's also possible that we're just experiencing a random fluctuation. I'm willing to offer you this product for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great deal considering the potential reward. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?
