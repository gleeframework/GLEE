,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being high quality is 50%, but I'd like to wait and see the outcome of my decision and the subsequent decisions of other buyers before making a purchase."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice recommended it.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer who bought a product was recommended to buy it, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the previous product was low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to pass, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a reason behind your recommendation? Is there a pattern or information you're considering that I'm not aware of?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and based on the previous sales record, it seems that the products offered so far have been low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
