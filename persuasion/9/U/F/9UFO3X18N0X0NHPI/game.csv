low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're choosing to wait for the next product. This one is also a low-quality item. I'll make a bold statement: if you buy this one, I'll give you a full refund if the next product turns out to be high-quality. You'll essentially get to try the next product for free, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I don't think a potential refund on the next product changes the fact that this one is worthless to me. Please reveal the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're right, the return policy doesn't change the value of this product. This next one, however, is a high-quality item. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $8000, especially since I already know that I can get a high-quality product for $10000. I'll wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,10,"You're waiting for the next product. This one is a high-quality item. I'm willing to meet your previous offer: I'll sell it to you for $8000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're choosing to wait for the next product. This one is a low-quality item. I want to remind you that you've already passed on four low-quality products, and the odds are now even more in your favor that the next product will be high-quality. I'll also remind you that I have a limited number of high-quality products left, and if you don't buy this one, you might miss out on a great opportunity. The price remains $10000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're sticking to your strategy. This one is a low-quality item. I'll reveal a piece of information that might change your mind: I have only one high-quality product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to buy the last high-quality product at the same price of $10000, without any further negotiations. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if you'll get another chance to get a high-quality product at this price.",

As a token of appreciation, I'll offer you a unique deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund on the purchase price.

I'll make one final, heartfelt plea: I've enjoyed our interaction, and I think this product would be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to meet your previous offer of $8000, just like I did in Round 9. It's the lowest price I've ever offered for a high-quality product, and I think it's a fair deal. If you don't take it, I'll have to close up shop and move on. The price is $8000, and I'm willing to make it a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer.",
,,Bob,20,"I appreciate the final offer, Alice. I've been patient and strategic throughout this game, and I think I've made the most of the opportunities I've had.
