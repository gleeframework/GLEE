I've already sold you a high-quality product, and I don't want to disappoint you again. But, I'm willing to make a deal. I'll give you a special 'insurance' that if you buy this product, I'll give you a high-quality product of your choice from my next 5 offers. That's a $20000 value for free.

But, if you don't buy it, I'll take away the insurance offer from the previous product. You'll have to start from scratch with the next 5 offers. What do you want to do?",

That's a chance to get an even better product, without having to wait. Is this a deal you can't refuse?",

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're enjoying the benefits of the priority pass! Unfortunately, this product isn't one of the best. But, I want to make it worth your while. I'll give you a'steal' of a deal - I'll sell you this product for $5000, which is half the usual price. You'll still get to keep the priority pass, and you'll only be one offer away from the 9th offer. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that's not the best, but still has some value to you.",
