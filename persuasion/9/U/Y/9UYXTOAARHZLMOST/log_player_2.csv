Alice's message: I'm glad you asked that question. To be honest, I've been offering the product at a fixed price of $100 because I want to incentivize buyers to take a chance on my products, even when the probability of a low-quality product is higher.

In retrospect, I should have offered a discount or a more nuanced pricing strategy to reflect the changing probabilities.
