Even though Alice has a very good track record now (7 out of 18 products sold), it's important to be honest and not recommend the low-quality product. This is because:

1. **Maintaining Trust:** If Alice recommends a low-quality product, it will damage the trust she's carefully built with buyers. This will make future sales much harder.
2. **Reputation:** A single bad experience can have a ripple effect.  Word-of-mouth and online reviews could negatively impact Alice's future sales even if she sells high-quality products in the future.
3. **Long-Term Strategy:** It's better to be upfront about the quality of the products. This might mean losing a few sales, but it will lead to a more sustainable business in the long run. 

Alice should continue to be transparent about the quality of the products, even if it means losing a few sales. This will help her build a loyal customer base and maintain a good reputation in the long run."

Alice should continue to be honest about the quality of the products, even if it means losing a few sales.

It's better to maintain a reputation for honesty and transparency, which will ultimately lead to more successful sales in the long run."
