The 5 discarded products are indeed a mix of high-quality and low-quality products. However, I'll let you in on a secret: I've been trying to get rid of the low-quality products as quickly as possible. So, I'd say that at least 3 of the discarded products were low-quality.

Alice's message: You're a curious one! Given the history of sales, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 53.85% (7/13).

Alice's message: I see your point. You're right to question the probability. Let me recalculate it for you. Out of 15 products sold or discarded, 7 have been high-quality and 8 have been low-quality. Given the last two products were low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
