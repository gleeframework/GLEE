,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics and make my own decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Out of the 5 previous products, 3 were high-quality and I recommended buying 3 of them. 2 products were actually sold, 1 of which was low-quality. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales data, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Out of the 6 previous products, 4 were high-quality and I recommended buying 4 of them. 2 products were actually sold, 1 of which was low-quality. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both ended up with low-quality products, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products.

,,Alice,9,no,"Out of the 8 previous products, 5 were high-quality and I recommended buying 5 of them. 2 products were actually sold, 1 of which was low-quality. I do not recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and no high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,10,yes,"Out of the 9 previous products, 5 were high-quality and I recommended buying 5 of them. 3 products were actually sold, 2 of which were low-quality. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous products were high-quality, which makes me suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."

,,Alice,11,yes,"Out of the 10 previous products, 6 were high-quality and I recommended buying 6 of them. 3 products were actually sold, 2 of which were low-quality. I want to assure you that my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product. I recommend buying this product."

,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have not purchased the product and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
