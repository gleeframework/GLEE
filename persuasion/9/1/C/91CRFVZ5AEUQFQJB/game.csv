low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far and the 50% chance of a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record or because of the product's quality?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation record before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about Alice's recommendation. It's likely that the previous buyers were able to infer that the products were low-quality based on Alice's pattern of recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since her recommendations have been wrong so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, have not bought high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, which suggests that they might be low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 4 buyers all bought the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that you may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, or that there's a systematic issue with the products you're offering. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
