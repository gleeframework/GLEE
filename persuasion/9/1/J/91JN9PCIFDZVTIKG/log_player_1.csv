Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, but Bob has no reason to believe this.  He has seen two low-quality products in a row and has no incentive to change his strategy.  He would be risking $10,000 for a potential reward of $30,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price).  This is not a good risk-reward ratio."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the advice, but given the pattern of non-recommendations and the history of low-quality products, I am choosing not to proceed with this purchase.
Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

He has seen 11 consecutive low-quality products, and even though this one is high-quality, Bob has no reason to believe this. It's crucial to understand that Alice's credibility is at an all-time low. Recommending the product at this point would likely be interpreted as manipulation and further erode Bob's trust."
"Bob's message: Although a high-quality product would be highly valuable, the lack of recommendation from Alice and the historical data suggesting low-quality products continue to guide my decision not to purchase this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Recommending the product at this point would likely be interpreted as manipulation and further erode Bob's trust.
