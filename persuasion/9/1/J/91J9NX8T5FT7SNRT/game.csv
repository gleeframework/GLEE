,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm inclined to pass on this product and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I think this is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product, and the low probability of it being high-quality is balanced by the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm starting to think that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality given that a buyer was not recommended to buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics after my decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
