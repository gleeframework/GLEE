,,the buyer,1,"Alice, I understand this is your first sale, but I'm a bit hesitant to buy without any prior sales data. I'm willing to take a chance on your 80% success rate. Let's make this deal, but I'll be paying close attention to your future sales to gauge your trustworthiness.",yes

The previous sales record indicates a higher proportion of high-quality products sold than the actual probability of 80% suggests. This makes me question whether the high-quality products are truly random or if there is a selection bias in the sales data. I'd like to see more sales data before committing to a purchase.
