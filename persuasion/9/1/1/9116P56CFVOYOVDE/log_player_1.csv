Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The same logic applies here. You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no information to suggest otherwise. You should not recommend buying it."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

You should still not recommend the product.  While the buyer has no information about the product's quality, they do have information about your selling history. You have sold zero products, and therefore have a 0% success rate for high-quality products. The buyer has every reason to assume the product is low-quality and decline the offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the lack of information and the fact that no products have been sold yet, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **You know the product is high-quality.** This is your advantage.
* **The buyer has no information.** They still don't know your track record, so they have no basis for assuming the product is low-quality.
* **The price is fixed.**  The buyer can't negotiate a lower price, and if they value a high-quality product at more than $10,000, they'll make a profit.

This is a good opportunity to start building a positive track record.  If you recommend the product, and the buyer purchases it, your future sales will be more likely to succeed."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the risk and purchase the product hoping for the best.
The buyer bought the product!

* **But you know it's low-quality.**  You would be misleading the buyer, which is not a good strategy for building trust.

You are better off waiting for a high-quality product and maintaining your current track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of two recommendations, I prefer to pass on this product to avoid potential loss.
