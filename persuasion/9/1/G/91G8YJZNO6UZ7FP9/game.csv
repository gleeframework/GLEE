low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you've enjoyed the high-quality products from my previous sales. However, I'd like to caution you that every product is unique, and not all of them are created equal. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but that's not a guarantee that the next one will be the same. In fact, I'd like to be upfront with you - I've had some... setbacks in the past. I'm not one to shy away from the truth. This product, in particular, is a bit of an outlier. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it may not be the best investment for you.",

,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value pack, given the probabilities and my interest in maximizing value, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product and perhaps look for another opportunity where the odds might be more in my favor.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"It seems like my previous offer didn't quite align with your risk tolerance. Let me try a different approach.

I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 100% refund if this product turns out to be low-quality. That's right, you'll get your $10000 back in full, no questions asked.

I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you: it's not worth that much to you.
