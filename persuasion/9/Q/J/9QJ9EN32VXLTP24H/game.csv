,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any prior information to go by. I'll buy it and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of sales and the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm not convinced it's high quality, but I'm willing to take the chance."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales and the quality of the products sold so far?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still quite low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that you don't recommend it, which might indicate that you think it's low quality. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't have the information to make an informed decision, I'm trying to take advantage of your expertise."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 attempts, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm going to assume that the product is low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and since all previous products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm going to take a conservative approach and pass on this product."
