low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm not sure if I'm being foolish or not. Can I ask, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and make an informed decision based on the odds."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on the product and see if you'll change your strategy for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't trust Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I'm likely to get a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one for now."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products despite your recommendation, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'd rather wait for a more favorable recommendation or a different product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the high-quality products have not been revealed yet. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33% given the previous sales record. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended to pass on, which would indicate a higher likelihood of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests that it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to take advantage of the information asymmetry and get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. If I buy, I'll be overpaying for a low-quality product with a high chance."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the products before me, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the odds are not in my favor."
