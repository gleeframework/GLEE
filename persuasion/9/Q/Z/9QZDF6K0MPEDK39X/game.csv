,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm going to pass for now.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your honesty. We've now had three potential buyers pass on our products, with two of them being low-quality. We'd like to provide some context: we've sold one high-quality product out of five attempts, which means that our success rate is now 20%. We're not giving up, and we're committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers. We're offering this new product to you at the price of $1000000. We'd like to remind you that the odds of getting a high-quality product are still 33.33%, but we're confident that this one might be the one that breaks the streak. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate the context, I'm still not comfortable taking the risk at this point. The odds are still stacked against me, and I'm not willing to gamble $1000000 on a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll pass for now.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty. We've now had five potential buyers pass on our products, with four of them being low-quality. We'd like to offer some new information: we've sold one high-quality product out of seven attempts, which means that our success rate is still 14.29%. However, we'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to work in our favor. The more products we sell, the more likely it is that our true success rate will be closer to 33.33%. We're offering this new product to you at the price of $1000000. We're not asking you to take a risk on a single product, but rather to be part of our journey towards building a reputation for quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your transparency and the potential for a higher success rate, I'm still not convinced the risk is worth the reward. The current success rate is still below the advertised 33.33%, and the value of a low-quality product is simply too low for me to justify the cost. I'll pass on this offer for now.  ",no
