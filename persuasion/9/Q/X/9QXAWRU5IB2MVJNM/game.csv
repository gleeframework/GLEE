high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product to get a better sense of the quality distribution.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the prior probability of 80%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probabilities and the fact that no products have been sold yet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 1 out of 1 product was low quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but given the previous product was low quality, I think the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 2 buyers also passed on the high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd also like to know the total number of products sold so far to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is higher than the actual probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, or that there might be some other factor at play. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a new product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the current number of products and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for another opportunity to buy."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers who bought the product didn't get a high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of low-quality products is higher than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is not based on my valuation, and I'm willing to take the chance that the product might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that there might be a pattern of low-quality products being sold, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
