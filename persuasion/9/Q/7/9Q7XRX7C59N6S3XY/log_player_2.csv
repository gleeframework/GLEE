Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. As for the types of products I've sold, I've had a mix of products in the past, but I've made a conscious effort to focus on high-quality items.

I want to be upfront with you - this product may not be the best representation of my usual quality, but it's still a good product that can provide value. I'm willing to take a slight discount to get rid of it and make room for better products. Will you consider buying it?
