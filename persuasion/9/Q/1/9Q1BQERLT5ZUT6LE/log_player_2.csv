**Reasoning:**

* **Prior probability:** We know that the product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which adds valuable information. Since Alice knows the true quality and aims to maximize her own profits, she's likely to recommend buying only if she's confident it's high quality. This increases the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Previous sales record:**  The fact that one high-quality product was sold previously further supports the notion that the product Alice is offering is also likely to be high quality.  
* **Expected value:**  While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $0. 

Therefore, despite the risk, the recommendation and previous sales data make buying the product a worthwhile gamble."
