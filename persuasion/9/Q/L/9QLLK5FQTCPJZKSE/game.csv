high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the first product and update the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not sure what to expect."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you sold 1 high-quality product to the previous buyer, but that's a small sample size. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, this is likely due to a coincidence, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'm not convinced that this is a representative sample, and I'd like to wait for more information before buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of sales, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a contrarian and I think Alice's recommendation is a good indication of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a product being high-quality is 25%, which is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality in general. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher than the expected 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think your recommendation is not very reliable. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like your recommendations are not very accurate."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not sure it's worth the risk given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 1 high-quality product sold out of 4 purchases, and the 2/3 chance of the product being low quality. I'm willing to take the risk to get a potential $400 value."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales and how you came up with your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about this product's quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
