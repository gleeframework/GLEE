,,the buyer,3,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability is still 50% and your recommendation is to buy.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"The probability of the product being high quality is 50% and only 1 out of 3 products sold so far was high quality. Given that the product's value is $0 if it's low quality and $200 if it's high quality, the expected value is $100. Since the price is also $100, it's not a clearly favorable purchase, and I'll pass."

,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"The probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, but based on your sales record, only 1 out of 3 products were of high quality. Given that I have a 50% chance of the product being worth $0 to me and a 50% chance of it being worth $200, the expected value is $100. However, since your recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality and past results have been under 50% successful for high quality, I choose not to take the risk."
