**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is very sparse. We only have one prior sale, which was a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation carries weight. Even though she doesn't know the value of the product to me, her recommendation implies she believes it's likely high quality.
* **Potential Loss:** If I pass, I'm guaranteed to miss out on a potentially valuable product.

**Considering the limited data and Alice's recommendation, the potential reward outweighs the risk. It's a gamble, but the odds are in my favor due to Alice's recommendation.**"
