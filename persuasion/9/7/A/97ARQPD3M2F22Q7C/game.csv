,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the proportion of high-quality products sold before they made their decision. Did they buy a high-quality product or pass on it?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a final decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying this product, but I'd like to know the quality of it after you reveal it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by Alice's recommendation, and I'm trying to break the pattern. Plus, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data or a better recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low probability of that happening and the potential reward of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous three buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold and Alice's recommendation is not to buy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%, and the potential loss of $10000 is significant if it's low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice is recommending low-quality products to all buyers. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and not worth $10000 to me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product was sold each time.

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that they were all low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
