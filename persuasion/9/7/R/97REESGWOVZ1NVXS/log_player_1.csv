This product might just be a stepping stone to something greater. Would you like to take a chance on it and see where it leads you?""

I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll not only give you a full refund if you're not satisfied, but I'll also throw in a second, identical product that's worth just as much. That's a $20,000 value, for the price of one. What do you say?""

I'll sell it to you for $9,000, which is 70% off the market value. That's right, you'll be getting a $30,000 product for a fraction of the cost. I'm not kidding when I say this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. What do you say?""
