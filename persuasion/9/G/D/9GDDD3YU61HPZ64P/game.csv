low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first product! Unfortunately, this one is also a low-quality product.

However, I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy this one, making it a $5000 product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again.",

I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to give you a chance to reassess the situation. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this one and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product. What do you think?",

Given the streak, I'm willing to make a bold offer: I'll give you a 20% chance to buy the next product for $8000, but if you don't take it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you make a decision.
