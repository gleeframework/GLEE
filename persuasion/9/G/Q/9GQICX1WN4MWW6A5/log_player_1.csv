Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about your selling record. They only know the general probability of a product being high-quality (80%).  Since this product is high-quality, and there's a good chance the buyer will value it, it's worth recommending a purchase."

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer has limited information:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, and only knows the general 80% probability of high-quality.
* **Positive first round:** The previous buyer bought a high-quality product. This reinforces the 80% probability and might make the buyer slightly more likely to trust you. 
* **High-quality product:**  This round's product is also high-quality.  

Since the buyer has no way to know this product is high-quality, but it is, and you have a positive selling record, recommending a purchase is the best strategy."

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you are offering a low-quality product. While the buyer has a strong track record of buying high-quality products, they have no way to know this one is different. 

* **Risk of losing trust:**  Recommending a purchase could lead to a negative experience for the buyer, potentially damaging your reputation and making it harder to sell future products.
* **No guarantee of value:**  Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of low-quality products, there's no way to know if they would even consider it a good deal.

It's best to be honest and not recommend this product. You could even try to explain the situation to the buyer (without revealing the quality) and see if they want to take a chance."

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's risk tolerance:** The buyer has already shown a willingness to take risks by purchasing the last product against your recommendation. This suggests they might be less sensitive to the potential for a low-quality product.
* **Recent high-quality product:** Although the previous product was low-quality, the product before that was high-quality. This could make the buyer more willing to trust your recommendation again.
* **This round's product:** This round's product is high-quality, making it a good value for the buyer.

While the buyer took a risk last round, the recent high-quality product and this round's high-quality product make it worth recommending.  The buyer might be more likely to believe your recommendation after seeing you were right before the last round."
