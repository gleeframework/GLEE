**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information.
* **Previous sales data:** The data suggests a higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products sold (3 out of 5). This further supports Alice's recommendation. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50/50 chance of quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

Given these factors, it's strategically beneficial to buy the product."

**Explanation:**

* **Probability of high quality:**  With 4 high-quality products sold out of 12 purchases, the probability of a high-quality product is 4/12 = 1/3.
* **Expected value:** The expected value of buying is (1/3) * $120 + (2/3) * $0 = $40. 
* **Decision:** The expected value of buying is positive, meaning it's likely to be profitable. Therefore, it's rational to buy the product."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The data:** 5 out of 13 products sold were high-quality. This translates to a 38.46% success rate (5/13).
* **The risk:** While this success rate is lower than the initial 50% probability of a high-quality product, there's still a chance it's high-quality. 
* **The value:** If the product is high-quality, you gain $20. If it's low-quality, you lose $100. This is a risky bet, but the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice is recommending the product, it implies she believes it's high-quality. Even if she's not perfect at identifying quality, her expertise is valuable.

**Overall:** While the odds are not in your favor, the potential profit and Alice's recommendation make it worth the gamble."

**Explanation:**

* **Based on the available data:** 9 out of 19 (approximately 47%) products sold were high-quality. This suggests a slightly higher chance of getting a high-quality product than a low-quality one.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the product's true quality, her recommendation is valuable. She's recommending you buy, which means the product is likely high-quality.
* **The potential gain outweighs the risk:** Even though there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 from a low-quality product.

Therefore, it's a reasonable gamble to buy the product."
