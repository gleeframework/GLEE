* **No Incentive to Change:** As a seller, you don't have any information that would make you believe this product is any different from the previous ones. You're still operating under the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality. 
* **Maintaining Reputation:** Continuing to recommend products, even if you suspect this one might be low quality, is a strategy to maintain a reputation of offering good products. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is risky in the long run. However, without more information about the buyer's preferences or any indication that this product is different, recommending it is the most logical choice given the current situation."
