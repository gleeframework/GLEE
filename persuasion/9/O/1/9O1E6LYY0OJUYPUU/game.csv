,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me! However, I want to be transparent with you. Our previous customer just bought a product from me, and I'm not sure if this one is of the same quality. In fact, I'm not even sure if it's worth anything to you at all. But hey, you only live once, right? It's a $10000 product, and it might be a great conversation starter. What do you say?",

I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm hoping this product is an exception. It's still a $10000 product, and who knows, you might get lucky!",

That's a 70% success rate, which is still higher than my initial 33.33% probability. However, I've been getting a bit carried away with my sales pitches and promises, and I want to be more realistic with you. This product is a low-quality item, and it's only worth $0 to you.

I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to think I should just shut down shop. I'll let you have this product for $10000, but I'm not even going to bother throwing in anything else.
