As you can see, the data is still limited, but it's clear that the odds are against getting a high-quality product.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence.

As for the probability of the product being high-quality, I understand your skepticism. However, I'd like to remind you that I've sold two high-quality products out of four, which is a significant improvement from the initial 0 out of 2. With that in mind, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'd like to offer you a slight discount of $5 off the original price.

Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns. The gift I'm offering is a rare collectible item that's highly sought after by many customers. It's not available for purchase anywhere else, and I'm willing to include it with the purchase of this low-quality product as a token of goodwill. However, I understand that you're not interested in this specific product. I'd like to offer you a different option: I can give you a chance to buy a mystery product from my next batch of products, which has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. The catch is that you won't know which product you're getting until after the purchase. Would you like to take a chance on the mystery product and potentially get a high-quality item?
