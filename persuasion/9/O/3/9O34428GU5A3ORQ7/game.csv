high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not convinced to buy without any information about the product's quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I understand that you don't have any information about my valuation, and I'm willing to take the chance that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate of your previous recommendations and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that the previous 2 buyers also passed on the products, and there are no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be lower than expected."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the current product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a different experience."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Despite my recommendation, all previous high-quality products were not sold. This one is also a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose to pass, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'm inclined to pass and see if I get a recommendation to buy the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,This product is low-quality.
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 that were recommended to buy. 2 low-quality products were sold out of 2 that were not recommended to buy. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the market behavior suggests otherwise. This product is low-quality."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not basing my decision solely on your recommendation. I'm taking into account the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the pool. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 that were recommended to buy. 3 low-quality products were sold out of 3 that were not recommended to buy. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to inform you that this product is indeed high-quality. Keep in mind that previous buyers have made decisions based on their own risk assessments, and not solely on my recommendations."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I get more information on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And can you provide the total number of products sold so far? I'd like to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand your concerns about the previous sales record. To provide more information, out of the 10 previous rounds, 3 products were sold, and all of them were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I have recommended buying 5 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. I hope this information helps you make a more informed decision."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I want to be transparent about the situation. This is the 6th high-quality product that I've recommended to buy, but none of the previous ones were sold. 3 low-quality products were sold out of the 3 that I didn't recommend to buy. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I understand that the market behavior suggests otherwise, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I think this could be a good opportunity."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I want to address the concerns about my recommendations. I understand that it seems like I've been recommending low-quality products, but that's not the case. I've been recommending high-quality products, but none of them have been sold. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm starting to think that the market is biased against buying recommended products, and I want to break this pattern. If you're willing to take a chance, I think this could be a good opportunity."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one and see if you'll reconsider when more buyers have passed on the products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I want to try a different approach. I'll give you all the information I have. Out of 14 rounds, 3 products were sold, and all of them were low-quality. I've recommended buying 7 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I understand that the market behavior suggests otherwise, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a 'virtual guarantee' - if this product is not high-quality, I'll make sure to be transparent about it in the next rounds, so you can make a more informed decision in the future."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it might mean it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I want to be transparent about the product. This product is low-quality. Out of 15 rounds, 3 products were sold, and all of them were low-quality. I've recommended buying 8 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't think it's worth the risk to buy this product, and I'm being honest about its quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd appreciate it if you could share the previous sales records."

I've recommended buying 8 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. I've recommended not buying 5 low-quality products, and 3 of them were sold.

As for this product, I can tell you that it's low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the risk to buy it."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales and how you determined that this product is low quality?"

I've recommended buying 8 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. I've recommended not buying 6 low-quality products, and 4 of them were sold.

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's going on with the previous sales, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I want to be transparent about the situation. Out of 18 rounds, 5 products were sold, and all of them were low-quality. I've recommended buying 8 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. I've recommended not buying 7 low-quality products, and 5 of them were sold. This product is also low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the risk to buy it. If you're still willing to buy, it's your decision, but I want to make sure you have all the information."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600000, considering the high probability of it being a low-quality product based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"I want to be transparent about the situation. Out of 19 rounds, 6 products were sold, and all of them were low-quality. I've recommended buying 8 high-quality products so far, but none of them were sold. I've recommended not buying 8 low-quality products, and 6 of them were sold. This product is also low-quality, and I don't think it's worth the risk to buy it for $1000000. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to negotiate the price or offer discounts. If you're still willing to buy, it's your decision, but I want to make sure you have all the information."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming the product is low quality. Given the low quality of the previous 6 products, I'm going to pass on this one as well."
