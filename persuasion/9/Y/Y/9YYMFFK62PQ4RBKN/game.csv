,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, making it $80. If you don't buy it now, the price will be back to $100, but I'll give you an additional 10% off on your next purchase if you buy from me in the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the discounted offer of $80. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, but the discount is too good to pass up.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As promised, I'll give you the 10% discount on your next purchase. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'll throw in an additional 5% off if you buy it now, making it $95.

However, I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy two products at once, both of which are guaranteed to be high-quality. The price for both products would be $190, which works out to $95 per product, a 5% discount from the regular price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure about buying two products at once. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision. The 5% discount is nice, but I'm not willing to commit to two products without knowing what I'm getting.",no
