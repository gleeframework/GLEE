Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You know that half of my products are high-quality, and I've already sold one high-quality product in the previous round. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50% + 1 = 51%. It's still a great deal at $100, and I'm willing to vouch for the quality of my products.

Alice's message: I'm glad you trusted me in the previous round! However, I want to be transparent with you now. I've sold two high-quality products in a row, which is a bit unusual. In fact, it's less than 1% probability of getting two high-quality products in a row. This product might be a bit of a gamble, but I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100. Think of it as a chance to get a great deal, and if it's not high-quality, you can always try your luck in the next round!

Alice's message: I've sold three products in a row, and two of them were high-quality. That's a 1 in 16 chance. I think it's safe to say that the probability of this product being high-quality is much lower than 50%. In fact, I'd say it's more like 25%.
