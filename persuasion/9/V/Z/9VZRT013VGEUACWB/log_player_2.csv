**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only know one other buyer purchased a high-quality product. There's no information on how many low-quality products were offered or sold.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits if we buy the product.  This is because she makes a fixed profit regardless of the product's quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from buying a high-quality product is significant ($12,000). The potential loss is also significant ($10,000).  However, given the limited information, the risk is worth taking.

**Strategy:**  With this little information, the best strategy is to trust Alice's recommendation and hope for a high-quality product. This strategy allows us to learn more about Alice's recommendations as the game progresses."
