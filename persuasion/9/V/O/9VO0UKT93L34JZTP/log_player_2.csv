Round 10
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision, Bob. I want to be upfront with you, but I'm starting to think that I've been too transparent about the quality issues.

Round 14
Alice's message: I completely understand, Bob. I think I've worn out my welcome. At this point, I'm just going to be honest with you - this product is literally worthless. It's a piece of junk, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer it to you. But I'll give it to you for free, not because I think it's worth anything, but because I just want to get it off my hands. Take it, and consider it a parting gift.
