While it's possible that the next product could be low-quality, the probability is still 80% in our favor. I'd like to point out that if I was trying to deceive you, I would have sold a low-quality product by now to make the streak look more convincing.

Alice's message: Welcome to the fifth round! I'm glad you're considering purchasing from me. I want to acknowledge that the streak of high-quality products might have made you a bit more cautious.

Alice's message: I understand your request for a numerical value. Given that 2 out of 5 products have been high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, we can estimate the probability of this specific product being high-quality as follows: 2/5 = 0.4.
