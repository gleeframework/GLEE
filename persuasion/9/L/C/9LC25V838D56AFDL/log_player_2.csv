Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. Let's focus on the probability of this product being high-quality. Since we know that 5 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, and 3 products remain, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of this product being high-quality. Given that 5 successes (high-quality products) out of 8 trials, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 5/7 = 71.43%.
