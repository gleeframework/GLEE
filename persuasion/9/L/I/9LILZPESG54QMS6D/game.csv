,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I'm also transparent about the fact that there's a 50% chance it might be a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. However, if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I completely understand. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to take the risk at this point, I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your hesitation in Round 1, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for more information. Now, I'd like to offer you a high-quality product, which is worth significantly more than $10000. In fact, I'm willing to tell you that the expected value of a high-quality product is at least $15000. Given the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm offering you this one for $10000, which is a 33% discount from its expected value. I think this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a steal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the information, but I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product. You're trying to convince me that the expected value is $15000, but you're not revealing the true quality of the product. I'd like to see more transparency about the product before making a decision.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else. What do you say?",

However, I'm willing to share with you that I've priced it at the lowest point I'm willing to go, and I'm not budging on the price of $10000. I'm hoping you'll take this opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the best quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if it's of better quality.",no

Now, I'd like to offer you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 50% refund if you don't like the product after purchasing it.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information about the complimentary service.

,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced. The estimated value of the complimentary service is within a wide range, and I'm not sure if it's worth the $10000 price tag. I'd like to see more transparency about the product itself, rather than just the bonus.",no
