"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to you, it's a gamble worth taking. Even if it's low quality, you lose nothing, and if it's high quality, you gain a lot.  The recommendation from Alice doesn't change the inherent odds, but it's good to be polite and acknowledge it."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling lucky!""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here as in round 1. The odds are still 50/50, and a high-quality product is worth significantly more than the purchase price. Alice's recommendation doesn't change the inherent probability, but it's still worth taking the chance for potential profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'll trust your judgment and buy this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been right twice in a row, which is a good sign for her ability to predict product quality. However, it's important to remember that each round is independent, and the odds remain 50/50.  Despite this, the streak provides a bit of confidence, and the potential for profit is still significant."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Hmm, interesting. You've been right so far, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. Thanks for letting me know your thoughts though!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has been right three times in a row, it's crucial to remember that each round is independent. Her recommendation is valuable, but it doesn't change the 50/50 odds. Since she's advising against buying this time, it's wiser to err on the side of caution.  There's no downside to passing and waiting for a product she recommends, as you have plenty of rounds left."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation was correct in Round 4, it's important to avoid getting caught in confirmation bias. Each round is independent, and the odds of a high-quality product remain at 50%. Since Alice continues to advise against buying, it's sensible to stick with the cautious approach and pass again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right before, and I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's track record has been mixed, it's essential to remember that each round is independent. The odds for each product remain 50/50, regardless of past outcomes. Alice's recommendation provides valuable information, and her past successes suggest she might have a better understanding of the product quality than random chance. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product."
