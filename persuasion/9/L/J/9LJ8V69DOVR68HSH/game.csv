high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality.

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendation, it seems like there's a pattern where you recommend low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 0.5. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, given that none of the previous 3 products sold were high-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
