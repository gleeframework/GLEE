**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending good products. 
* **No Risk:** Given the perfect track record and the fact that a low-quality product is worth nothing to me, there is no risk in purchasing the product. Even if it turns out to be low quality, I haven't lost anything. 
* **Potential High Reward:** The potential reward of $30,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) outweighs the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is incredibly strong evidence that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, coupled with the strong sales data, makes it highly likely that the current product is of high quality.
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the risk of $0 if the product is low-quality, especially given the strong indicators. 

**Important Note:**  This decision assumes that Alice is acting in good faith and not manipulating the data or recommendations. There's always a risk in any situation like this. However, the information provided makes buying the product the most logical choice."
