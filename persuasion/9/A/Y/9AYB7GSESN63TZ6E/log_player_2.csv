**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know the product's quality, she's still recommending it. This suggests she has some internal information or a good strategy that makes her confident in the product's value.

**Potential Risks:**

* **Small Sample Size:** One sale is not a large enough sample to be entirely confident about the success rate. It's possible that the initial product was an outlier.
* **Alice's Incentives:** Alice might be incentivized to recommend products even if they are low quality, as she makes a profit on each sale.

**Overall, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product given the current information.**"
