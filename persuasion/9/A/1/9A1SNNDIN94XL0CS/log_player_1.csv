"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since you're not recommending the product and there is no sales history to go on, I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait to see how other buyers fare with the product before making a decision.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

We still have no information on the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products.  Recommending a product without this information is risky. There's no reason to believe this product is worth $100 to the buyer, especially since we've had two low-quality products in a row.  It's better to continue observing buyer behavior to gain more information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'll pass on this one. Since there's no history of sales, I'm not confident enough to take a chance on this product without knowing its quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still have no information about the buyer's valuation of the products.  We've had three low-quality products in a row.  Given this history, and the fact that the buyer hasn't purchased anything yet, it's highly unlikely that they would value this product at $100.  Therefore, it's best to not recommend it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet, I'd prefer to pass on this product. I'd like to see how other buyers react to the product first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still lack crucial information:

* **Buyer's Valuation:** We don't know how much the buyer values high-quality or low-quality products.
* **Sales History:** We have no evidence of successful sales, only a pattern of buyers declining the offer.

Recommending the product without this information would be risky.  It's likely the buyer would consider it a gamble since they have no data to inform their decision.  The buyer's previous statements indicate they are unwilling to purchase without a track record of successful sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since there's no historical data yet and you don't recommend the product, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still lack information about the buyer's valuation of the products. We've had a string of low-quality products, and the buyers have consistently declined to purchase.  It's not possible to know if the buyer would even consider a high-quality product at this price point, as we have no information about their willingness to pay.  Recommending the product would be a gamble with no real basis, and it's safer to continue observing the buyers' behavior."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm hesitant to buy without more information. Perhaps if you can offer a discount or share some insights about the products, I would be more inclined to buy.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still have no information about the buyer's valuation of the products.  Despite the high-quality product in the previous round, the buyer still hasn't bought anything.  It's clear that the buyer is unwilling to risk purchasing without a track record of successful sales.  Therefore, it's still safer to not recommend this product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. However, since this is the first product and there is no data to base my decision on, I will pass.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

**Explanation:**

We still lack information about the buyer's valuation of the products. We have no evidence of any sales, and buyers consistently decline to purchase even after a high-quality product was offered.  There is no reason to believe this buyer will value the product at $100. Recommending the product without this information would be a risky gamble, as there is no indication they are willing to purchase.  It's still best to continue observing buyer behavior to gain more information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet, I'm going to pass for now.  I'd like to see how the product performs with other buyers first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Explanation:**

We still have no information about the buyer's valuation of the products.  There is no indication that the buyer would consider purchasing, despite offering a high-quality product for multiple rounds.  The buyers have consistently declined to purchase without information about the products' quality, and we don't have data to share yet.  Therefore, recommending the product would be a risky move with no evidence to support it. It's best to continue observing the buyer's behavior to gain more information."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since this is the first product and I have no data to go by, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll keep an eye on your sales history and see if I can make a better informed decision later.

**Explanation:**

We still lack vital information about the buyer's valuation of products.  Despite offering several high-quality products in a row, we have no record of any sales. This indicates that buyers are hesitant to purchase without a clear understanding of the products' quality.  Without knowing how much they value a high-quality product, recommending it would be a risky gamble with no guarantee of success. It's best to continue observing buyer behavior and wait for a more informed decision."

**Explanation:**

Despite offering a string of high-quality products, we still haven't secured a single sale.  This suggests that buyers are highly risk-averse and unwilling to purchase without data on the products' quality.  Without knowing how much the buyer values a high-quality product, recommending it would be a risky gamble. It's essential to continue observing the buyer's behavior to gain more information before making a recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no previous sales data, I will pass on this product. I'm not comfortable buying without any indication of product quality.

**Explanation:**

We still lack crucial information about the buyer's valuation of the products.  Despite offering high-quality products for several rounds, we haven't managed to secure any sales.
