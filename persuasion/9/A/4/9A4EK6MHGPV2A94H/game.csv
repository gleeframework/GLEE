low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as it's the first product and I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy from you purchased the product, I'm going to assume that the products recommended to buy are low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. If I were to pass, the product would be discarded, and I'd never know if it was high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I think the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products that were recommended were likely low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality since none were sold. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality item for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not based on any information about the product's quality, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not purchase the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
