,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. I appreciate you addressing my concerns. However, I'm still hesitant about the non-refundable policy.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your caution. However, I'm afraid I can't offer a partial refund or a guarantee on this product. As I mentioned earlier, the price is final, and the product is non-refundable. But I want to emphasize that this product is still a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. Think about it, Bob - you're getting a product that's still worth $1000000, and you're getting it at a price that's already discounted. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I assure you. And who knows, you might be surprised by the product's performance. It's not perfect, but it's still a great value. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this opportunity?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and your belief in this product. However, the lack of a guarantee or any form of risk mitigation still makes me uncomfortable. While I acknowledge the potential value, the risk of a low-quality product is too great for me to justify purchasing without any protection.
