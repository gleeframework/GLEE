**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 9 high-quality products sold out of 9 purchases, the recommendation is highly likely to be accurate.
* **Limited Risk:** The product is only worth $0 if it's low quality, meaning the potential loss is limited.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing means missing out on a high-quality product with a very high probability."
