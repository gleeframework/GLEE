This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a great price.",

However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is actually 80%, not 20%. With each passing round, the likelihood of getting a high-quality product increases. I've now sold two high-quality products, and I'm confident that this next one will be just as great. Would you like to reconsider and take advantage of this opportunity at $10000?",
