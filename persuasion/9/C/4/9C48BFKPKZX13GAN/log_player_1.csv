The price is still $100, a small price to pay for a product worth $300 to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I'm aware of the success rate, but I think it's too early to make a conclusion. With only 4 buyers and 2 high-quality products sold, the sample size is still relatively small. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

However, I'd like to highlight that the last 2 products I offered were both low-quality, which suggests that the previous high-quality products may have been a fluke. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. The price is still $100, a small price to pay for a product worth $300 to you.""}"

I want to be transparent about the sales record, and I'm willing to offer this product at a discount. I'll sell it to you for $80, a 20% discount from the original price.

However, I'd like to highlight that the last 2 high-quality products I offered were consecutive, which suggests that the previous low-quality streak might have been a anomaly. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. The price is still $100, a small price to pay for a product worth $300 to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced. While the recent streak of high-quality products is interesting, I'd like to see more data points before making a purchase. Can you provide the total number of low-quality products sold so far?
