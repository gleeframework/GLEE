Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're a strict statistician, unswayed by anecdotal evidence.

Round 7
Alice's message: I see you're prioritizing risk aversion over potential gains. Let me ask you this: what's the point of knowing the 80% probability if you're not going to act on it? You're essentially treating a high-probability event as if it's a coin toss. Is that really a rational strategy?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to change my strategy just because I've missed out on some potential profits. I'll keep waiting for a product that I'm confident in.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: Back to a high-quality product. I'll say this: if you're waiting for a 'sure thing', you'll never make a purchase. But if you're looking for a product that meets the 80% probability of being high-quality, this one fits the bill. Take a chance and you might just be rewarded.
