I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a complimentary service that's usually worth $1000.

,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I have to say, I'm a bit skeptical about the sudden change of heart. If I'm being honest, I'd rather you not know the quality of the product beforehand, so I can make a decision based on the actual quality, not just your words. But I'll take the chance.
