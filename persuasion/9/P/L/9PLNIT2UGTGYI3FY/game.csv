,,Alice,1,"I have a product to sell you for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a low price because it's a low-quality product. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, but if you don't, I'll have to sell it to someone else and you might miss out on a unique opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, thank you for the offer.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a product that I'm very confident you'll be impressed with. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a fair price considering its quality. I've had a lot of interest in this product, so if you don't buy it now, you might miss out on the chance to own it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take a chance on this high-quality product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! I have another high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. Since you've already shown a willingness to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a similar deal on this one. However, I want to make sure you're aware that this product is even more valuable than the last one, so I'm not sure if you'll be willing to pay the same price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm also open to negotiating if you think it's worth more.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm happy to pay $1000000 for this high-quality product, just like the last one. I'm not sure what makes this one more valuable, but I'm willing to take the chance.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I want to be transparent with you - I've been offering you high-quality products at the same price, and I'm starting to think you might not be valuing the quality as much as I thought. I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I want to give you a chance to make a higher offer. If you're willing to pay more than $1000000, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the high-quality product for $1000000. I'm not willing to pay more than that.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're not valuing the quality of the products as much as I thought. Three high-quality products in a row, and you're still willing to pay the same price. I'm going to take a chance and ask you a question: are you willing to pay a premium for a product that is not only high-quality but also unique and exclusive? If so, I might have something special for you.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in paying a premium for a product, regardless of its exclusivity. I'll stick to the standard price of $1000000 for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your stance on pricing, and I respect it. However, I want to make one more offer to you. Since you've been consistent in your purchasing behavior, I'm willing to give you a small incentive to consider this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a discount of $100000 from the standard price. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the high-quality product for $900000. That's a good deal.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! However, I want to go back to the original price of $1000000 for this high-quality product. I've been observing your behavior, and I think you're willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but only if it's at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your stance on the guarantee. Since you're not interested in it, I'll go back to the standard price of $1000000 for this high-quality product. However, I want to make one more point clear: I've been offering you high-quality products for the past few rounds, and you've consistently been willing to pay $1000000 for them. I think you're undervaluing the quality of these products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to give you a chance to make a higher offer. If you're willing to pay more than $1000000, I'll consider it.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think we're stuck in a pattern. You're consistently willing to pay $1000000 for high-quality products, and I'm consistently willing to sell them to you at that price. I'm going to try something different this time. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a bonus: I'll give you a chance to buy another high-quality product at the same price, without even knowing what it is. If you're interested, I'll wrap it up and you can unwrap it later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not interested in buying a mystery product. I'll only buy the current product if I know its quality and can pay the standard price of $1000000.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns about the mystery product. I'll go back to the standard offer.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we've established a routine. However, I have to admit that I'm a bit surprised by the product I have for you this time. It's not as high-quality as the previous ones, and I'm not sure if you'll be satisfied with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as valuable as the others. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell it to you for $500000. That's 50% off the standard price.",
