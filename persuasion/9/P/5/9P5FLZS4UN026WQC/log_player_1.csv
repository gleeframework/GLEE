I'd like to offer you some additional context: we've sold a total of 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I want to be transparent with you - we've had two consecutive low-quality products, which could indicate that we're experiencing a streak of bad luck. I'm offering you the opportunity to buy this product at the price of $1,000,000. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity.""}"

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""You've seen that 3 out of the last 4 products were high-quality, which is a significant deviation from the expected 80% probability. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and we've sold a total of 5 products so far, with 3 of them being high-quality. This means that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and we're seeing a more representative sample of our product quality. Given this context, is the potential reward of a high-quality product worth the risk of the remaining 20% chance of getting a low-quality product?""}"

This means that there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, and we've just experienced that. I'm not trying to downplay the streak, but I want to keep things in perspective. With that said, I'm still offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at the price of $1,000,000.
