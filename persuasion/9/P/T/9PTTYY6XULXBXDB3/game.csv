,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just roll the dice!"

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced based on the limited data, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good opportunity for me to get it for $100, and I can take advantage of the low price since I think you would have bought it if you thought it was high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the 2 previous buyers didn't buy it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose not to, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining stock is still 50%, but it also suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality. I'd rather wait for a more informative signal before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
