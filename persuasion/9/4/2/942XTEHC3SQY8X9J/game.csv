low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I appreciate your interest in my product! However, I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, only 1 has been high-quality. This means that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the average. I'm still confident in the value of this product, but I want to give you a fair warning.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I want to be upfront with you. Out of the 3 products I've sold, only 1 has been high-quality, and the last two have been low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than initially thought. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that the odds are against it being high-quality. You might want to reconsider your decision.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think I've been selling a lot of lemons. Out of the 5 products I've sold, only 1 has been high-quality, and the last four have been low-quality. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to be honest with you. The odds are not in our favor. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth the risk.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ah, finally! I'm glad to be offering a high-quality product again! Out of the 6 products I've sold, 2 have been high-quality, and 4 have been low-quality. While this is still a relatively low ratio, I'm hoping that the next few sales will be more balanced. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're aware of the initial probability of 80% for high-quality products! As I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total, it seems that the probability is still holding up. However, I want to caution you that the last two high-quality products were consecutive, which is a bit unusual. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item, but I want to make sure you're aware of the slightly unusual pattern.",

However, the last two high-quality products were consecutive, and now this one is low-quality. I'm starting to wonder if I've been overestimating the quality of my products. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $10000, and I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. It's a risk, and you should be aware of the recent pattern.",
