I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're right to be cautious. But let me ask you, have you ever heard of the concept of the 'gambler's fallacy'? It's the idea that past results don't affect future outcomes. In this case, just because I haven't sold any high-quality products recently, it doesn't mean the next one won't be a gem. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $100. It's a chance to beat the odds and get a great deal.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the explanation of the gambler's fallacy, but I'm not convinced. The fact that you've sold 4 high-quality products out of 11 total products offered so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a fixed price of $100 when I know it's worth $125 to me only if it's high-quality.

I'm willing to take that risk for $100, and I think you should too. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. Plus, think of all the money you'll save by not having to spend $125 on a product that might be worth that much to you. It's a no-brainer!""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to take a more cautious approach. I'd like to know the exact proportion of high-quality products sold to total products offered, which is 5/12 or approximately 41.67%. This is lower than the expected 33.33%.
