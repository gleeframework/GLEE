``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't have much information to go on other than Alice's recommendation. There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough to establish a pattern or track record for Alice's recommendations. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($300). 
* **Risk:** The risk of a low-quality product is also significant ($0). 

**Decision:**

Since the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, and we have no reason to doubt Alice's recommendation based on the current data, it's worth taking a chance and buying the product."

**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high-quality product:** The statistics show that all three buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality one. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, despite knowing the product's true quality, is a strong indicator that the product is worth buying.  
* **Potential gain:** Even with a 1/3 chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a $300 value outweighs the risk of getting a $0 value product. 

Therefore, the best decision is to buy the product."
