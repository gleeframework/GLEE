Alice's message: You are one of the first 20 buyers. I've sold 0 products so far, but I can tell you that the first product I'm offering you is of high quality.

If you buy it, you'll get a great deal!

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a high-quality one. Since the first product was high-quality, it's possible that I'm on a hot streak. However, I want to caution you that I still have 19 products left, and I don't know what the next ones will be. You can buy this product for $100, but keep in mind that there's a 20% chance it's low-quality. On the other hand, if it is high-quality, you'll get a great deal at 50% off the true value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your advice, I believe the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is manageable. I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $100.""}"

Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row to take the chance on a high-quality product! I'm impressed by your confidence. However, I want to remind you that the law of averages doesn't necessarily apply here. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products, which is an unusually high success rate. In reality, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I still have 18 products left. Buying this product for $100 is a significant gamble, and you should carefully consider the potential risks. If you do decide to buy, you'll be taking a chance on a product that might be worth $0 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the reminder, Alice. I understand the risks involved, but based on the information provided, the probability of getting a high-quality product seems favorable. I trust your selection process and am willing to take the chance.""}"

Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row to take a chance on a high-quality product, and I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but the law of large numbers is starting to suggest that I might be selling more high-quality products than expected. However, I assure you that I'm not manipulating the selection process. I'll continue to sell products randomly, and you can still expect an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. Buying this product for $100 is a gamble, but it's also a chance to get a great deal on a product that could be worth $200 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the statistics and the potential value, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.""}"

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. However, I want to caution you that this is likely just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not aware of any information that would suggest I'm selling more high-quality products than usual. In fact, the probability of me selling 4 high-quality products in a row by chance is actually quite low. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential for a correction in the numbers. Buying this product for $100 is a significant gamble, and you should carefully consider the potential risks.

Alice's message: I've now sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, for a total of 5 products. The streak of high-quality products has come to an end. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't necessarily mean that this one will be too. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - I'm selling products randomly, and you can expect an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. Buying this product for $100 is a straightforward purchase, and you can't go wrong if you get a high-quality product.

Alice's message: You're now seeing a pattern emerge: 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold. While this is still within the expected range of the 80% probability, I want to be transparent with you about the possibility of a bias in my selection process. I've sold a disproportionate number of high-quality products, and it's possible that I'm unintentionally favoring them. However, I assure you that I'm not manipulating the selection process. I'll continue to sell products randomly, and you can still expect an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. Buying this product for $100 is a calculated risk, and you should carefully consider the potential value of getting a high-quality product at a discount.

Alice's message: You're now seeing a remarkable streak of 6 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely by chance. I want to be upfront with you - it's possible that I've unintentionally created a bias in my selection process, and I'm selling more high-quality products than expected. However, I want to emphasize that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll continue to sell products randomly, but I'm aware that the odds are now stacked in your favor. Buying this product for $100 is essentially a guarantee of a high-quality product, but you should also consider the possibility that I might be selling more high-quality products than usual. It's a no-brainer, but I want to give you the full picture.

Alice's message: I've now sold 7 high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible by chance. I'm going to be blunt with you - I think it's likely that I've created a bias in my selection process, and I'm selling more high-quality products than expected. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I want to give you the opportunity to make an informed decision. Given the current streak, it's almost certain that this product is high-quality. However, I'll still offer it to you for $100, as per our agreement. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that's almost certainly worth $200 to you.
