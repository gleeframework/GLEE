  ""message"": ""I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a steal considering its true value is $300. I'm willing to sell it to you at a loss just to get rid of it, and I'm only doing this because I really need to clear out some space. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a much higher price. The price is firm, but I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.""
}"

Since you're interested in knowing the true odds, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a great price, and you'll also get a future discount on another product. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in a bait-and-switch offer. I'd like to know the true value of the product I'm buying, not a promise of future discounts. I'll only consider buying if you reveal the product's quality upfront.

If you're interested, I'll throw in a small bonus: I'll give you a $50 gift card that you can use on a future purchase, if you decide to buy from me again. No strings attached.""

  ""message"": ""I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider.

}"
