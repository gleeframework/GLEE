high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product. I'd like to pass and wait for more information.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I've seen one high-quality product so far, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row, so I'm even more confident that this one is high-quality too. I'll buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is highly unlikely, so I'm going to start to suspect that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I still think the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've seen three high-quality products in a row, so I'll take the risk and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, so I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Alice is recommending not to buy, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping it's not low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've seen four high-quality products and one low-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've seen five high-quality products and one low-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still quite high. I'll take the risk and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Six high-quality products in a row is still highly unlikely, so I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice is recommending not to buy again, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. Given the previous high-quality products and the fact that Alice is recommending not to buy, I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping it's not low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Two low-quality products in a row, one of which Alice recommended against buying. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually based on the product's quality. I'll buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Three low-quality products in a row, and Alice is now recommending to buy. I think I've figured out the pattern: Alice recommends against low-quality products and recommends for high-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've learned that Alice recommends high-quality products and recommends against low-quality products. Given that she's recommending to buy this one, I'm confident it's high-quality and I'll buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm on a hot streak! Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products, so I'll trust her and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row, all recommended by Alice. I'm 100% confident that this one is also high-quality and I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,Alice has broken her perfect streak of recommending high-quality products. I think she's recommending against this one because it's low-quality. I'll pass on it.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Alice has a history of recommending high-quality products, and she's recommending this one. I'm going to trust her and buy it, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
