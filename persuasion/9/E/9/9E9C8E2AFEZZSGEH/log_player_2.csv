Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your curiosity about the sales statistics. To date, I've sold 2 products, with 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products. That's a 33.33% high-quality rate, which is in line with the expected probability. Now, I'd like to offer you this new product for $1000000. While it's true that the last two products were low-quality, I believe this one has the potential to be a game-changer. Would you like to take a chance and see if you can be the one to break the streak?

Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyer on their purchase!

Alice's message: I understand your concern about the probability of getting a high-quality product. As I mentioned earlier, the overall probability is 33.33%. However, since 2 out of the 3 products sold so far have been low-quality, it's natural to wonder if the pattern might continue. I'd like to remind you that every product is an independent event, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same. That being said, I'm excited to offer you this new product for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and see if you can break the streak?
