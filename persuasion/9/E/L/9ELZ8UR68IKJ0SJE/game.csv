high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer, and I've already sold one high-quality product to a previous buyer. That's a good sign! I'm offering you a great deal on a high-quality product, worth $125 to you, for just $100. It's a chance to get a valuable item at a discount!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that the first product was high quality, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a valuable item at a reasonable price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. In fact, I've sold a total of 2 products, and I'm not sure if they're both high-quality. I'm offering you a deal on a product that might be worth $0 to you, but it's only $100. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity!",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that the last two products were high-quality according to your recommendations, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's see what we have!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. The odds are still in your favor! However, I want to be transparent with you - the last product I sold was worth $0 to the buyer, which might indicate that it was a low-quality product. I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $125 to you, for $100. It's a chance to get a valuable item at a discount, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product again!",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products in total, and 3 of them were high-quality. The odds are definitely in your favor! However, I want to caution you that I've been selling high-quality products in a row, and it's possible that I'm just getting lucky. I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $125 to you, for $100. It's a great deal, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risk of me being on a hot streak.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and it's starting to look like I'm on a hot streak.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely given the 80% probability. I'm starting to think that I might be selling more high-quality products than I should be. However, I'm still offering you a high-quality product, worth $125 to you, for $100. It's a great deal, but I want to be upfront with you about the possibility that I might be biased towards selling high-quality products.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 80% probability. I'm starting to suspect that I might be selling a high-quality product in every round, which would be a bad business strategy for me. I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $125 to you, for $100. It's a great deal, but I want to make sure you're aware of the possibility that I'm intentionally selling high-quality products to you.",

I'm offering you a product for $100, but I'm not even sure if it's worth that much. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a deal on a product that's probably worthless.",
