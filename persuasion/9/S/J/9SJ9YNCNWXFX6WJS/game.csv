,,Alice,2,yes,

I understand that your recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I'm not getting any information from previous sales, so I'll make a decision based on the 50% chance of the product being high-quality."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, I'm concerned that the probability might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them purchased high-quality products.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and have chosen to do so, it seems likely that the product is of low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the seller's recommendation, I'm suspicious and want to see if the product is indeed high-quality."
