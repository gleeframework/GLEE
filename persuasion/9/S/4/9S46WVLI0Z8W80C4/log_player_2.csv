Alice's message: Ah, great decision on the previous purchase! I'm glad you're willing to take a chance. Now, let me ask you, have you heard about the concept of 'law of large numbers'? With my previous sales record being 0/0, it's like we're starting from scratch. But I'll give you a hint: I've sold a total of 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I'm willing to sell this next one to you for $10000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say? Will you take it home?
