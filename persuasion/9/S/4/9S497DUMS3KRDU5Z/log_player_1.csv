Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know this product is low-quality.  Since the buyer has no information about the specific product and the price is high, it's highly unlikely the buyer will get a good deal. There's no incentive for the buyer to purchase, especially given the non-refundable nature of the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product. I don't have any prior information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on my instincts.

Overall, it's still risky, but recommending the product has a better chance of success this round."

* **Market Perception:** The buyer might be forming a negative perception of the seller, especially since the last two high-quality products were declined. They might be expecting more low-quality products.

* **Buyer Information:**  The buyer has seen four previous transactions: one low-quality sale and three high-quality sales declined. They are likely expecting low quality due to the recent history. 
* **Market Perception:** The buyer may be hesitant due to the lack of sales. However, the seller is only recommending when they believe the product is high-quality. This consistency might start to build trust.

* **Price:** The price is still high, and the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high.

* **Price:** The price is high, and the risk of buying another low-quality product is too high.

They are likely very aware of the seller's recent pattern of recommending low-quality products.
* **Market Perception:** The buyer is likely highly skeptical of the seller's claims and might even be considering the seller to be dishonest. They have experienced a low-quality product themselves, and the seller's track record is not improving.
* **Price:** The price is high, and the risk of buying another low-quality product is extremely high.

Overall, recommending this product would almost certainly lead to another decline. The seller has lost most of their credibility with buyers, making future sales extremely difficult. It is in the seller's best interest to change their strategy and build trust with potential buyers."

"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering that only 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product and 1 of those was a high-quality product, I'm hoping the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50.00%.
