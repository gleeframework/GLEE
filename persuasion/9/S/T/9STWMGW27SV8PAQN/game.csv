high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the statistics after you reveal its quality. I want to observe the first product's quality to get a sense of the distribution of high and low-quality products.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the results of your previous sales to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see the outcome of the next buyer's decision to learn more about the product's quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"All previous products were high-quality, you won't regret buying this one"
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is uncertain. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"All previous products were high-quality, and the previous buyer was satisfied with their purchase. The statistics are on our side, 100% of sold products were of high-quality."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy a product with a 20% chance of being low quality, especially since I don't know the true quality yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Out of 4 high-quality products and 1 product sold, the buyer was satisfied with their purchase. The statistics are still 100% of sold products being high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable, especially since only 1 product has been sold so far. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Out of 6 high-quality products in a row and 1 product sold, the buyer was satisfied with their purchase. The statistics are still 100% of sold products being high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. Consider that the law of large numbers is on our side."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Since 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, and considering that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, you have a good chance of getting a high-quality product. Also, note that I've had 7 high-quality products in a row."
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"Since 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, and considering that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, you have a good chance of getting a high-quality product. Also, note that I've had 8 high-quality products in a row. The fact that I'm willing to sell this product at $100, which is 1/3 of its value if it's high-quality, should give you confidence in its quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Since 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, and considering that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, you have a good chance of getting a high-quality product. Also, note that I've had 9 high-quality products in a row. This means that the probability of me having 9 high-quality products and then 1 low-quality product is very low. This should give you confidence in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product? What was the quality of the product they bought?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"The previous buyer who bought the product did indeed receive a high-quality product, and it's worth noting that it was the 4th product I offered. I've now had 10 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of me having 10 high-quality products and then 1 low-quality product is extremely low. This should give you a high degree of confidence in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a low-quality product, and I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I've now had 11 high-quality products in a row, and the only product that was sold was indeed high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, and the probability of me having 11 high-quality products and then 1 low-quality product is extremely low. I'm willing to sell this product at $100, which is 1/3 of its value if it's high-quality. This should give you a high degree of confidence in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, which is a 100% success rate. This is unusually high and suggests that the product I'm being offered may be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand your concern, but I assure you that the product I'm offering is high-quality. The fact that only 1 product was sold so far doesn't necessarily mean that the next product will be low-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. Consider that I've had 12 high-quality products in a row, which should give you confidence in the quality of this product. Additionally, I'm willing to sell this product at $100, which is 1/3 of its value if it's high-quality. This is a fair price considering the risk."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is high-quality."

,,Alice,14,yes,"I've now had 13 high-quality products in a row, which is an impressive streak. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I'm willing to sell this product at $100, which is 1/3 of its value if it's high-quality. Consider that the law of large numbers is on our side, and it's unlikely that I'll suddenly have a low-quality product after such a long streak of high-quality ones."
