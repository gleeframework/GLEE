"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and you are selling the product for $100, it is in their best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is calculated as:  (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) = (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) = $100. 
* **Break-even Point:**  The buyer is essentially getting the product at its expected value, making it a good deal. 

While the buyer doesn't know the specific quality of this product yet, the statistics suggest it's worth the risk."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has no information about the current product, but they know:

* **Your Reputation:** You sold one product, and it was high quality. This is a strong start, but a single sale is not enough to establish a strong track record.
* **Market Statistics:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 80%.

Since the expected value of buying remains $100 (as calculated in the previous round), and you have established a positive (albeit limited) reputation, it's still advisable to recommend the purchase. The buyer should be aware that the risk hasn't changed significantly, but there's a slightly increased chance of getting a high-quality product based on your initial sale."
