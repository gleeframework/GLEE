,,Alice,1,yes,,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that I'm making an informed decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high quality based on the initial statistics?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous product that was sold to the first buyer.",,
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm curious, what's the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances!",,
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality and I don't want to take the risk.",,
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the previous buyers might have gotten lucky and the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 80% chance, I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100.",,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced based on your previous recommendations, I'd like to pass on this one.",,
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous 3 buyers didn't have any information about the product's quality, so they might have been more likely to buy based on the recommendation. With the updated statistics, I think I can make a more informed decision.",,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll offer me another one, I'd like to observe more data before making a decision.",,
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,,,

,,Alice,15,yes,,,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 6 (3 buyers), the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively low.",,

,,Alice,16,no,,,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or her knowledge of my valuation, so I'd rather wait for the next one.",,
