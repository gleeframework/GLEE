,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me? I'd like to make an informed decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but since I don't have any information about the quality, I'll rely on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. This is lower than the true probability of 80%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will make a better decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the recommendation is to buy, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect the proportion to be higher than 1/3 if the true proportion was 80%. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
