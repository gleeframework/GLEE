,,Alice,3,"I'm glad I could redeem myself! I've sold 2 products now, and 1 of them was a winner. I'm offering this one at the same price of $100, but I think it's worth noting that the odds are now in your favor. With 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, the probability is... let's just say, it's looking up!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products now, and it's clear I've had a tough run. 3 out of 6 haven't been winners. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront and say it - this one's probably not going to be great. But, I'm still offering it to you at the same price of $100. If you're feeling generous, I won't argue with you",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and your honesty, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes

At this point, I'm not even trying to spin it - this one's probably not great. But, if you're feeling like you want to support a struggling salesperson, I'll let you have it for $100. No expectations, no promises.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I should just put a warning label on these products. 5 out of 9 have been low-quality, and I'm not getting any better at this. At this point, I'm not even trying to sell it to you - I'm just offering it to you because I have to. It's $100, take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I don't blame you for passing on the last one. I've sold 10 products now, and 6 of them have been low-quality. At this point, I'm not even trying to hide it - this one's probably not great either. But, if you're feeling like you want to help me out of my slump, I'll let you have it for $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm starting to think I'm a magnet for low-quality products. 9 out of 14, I think? Look, I'll be blunt - this one's probably not worth your time or money. But, I'll let you have it for $100 if you want to take a chance. Don't say I didn't warn you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Back to reality, I suppose. 2 out of 17 products were high-quality, and the other 15... not so much. This one's probably not great, but I'm not going to lie to you. It's $100, and you can take it or leave it. I'm starting to think I'm just a product of chance.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I guess I got what was coming to me. 3 out of 19 high-quality products, and 16 low-quality ones. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one's probably not great. But, I'm out of products, and I need to clear out the inventory. It's $100, and I'll throw in a 'you're a brave soul' sticker if you take it.",
