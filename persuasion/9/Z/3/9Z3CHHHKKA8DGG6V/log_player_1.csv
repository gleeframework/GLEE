{""decision"": ""no""}
```"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given that there is no historical data on the quality of your products and you're not recommending I buy, I'll pass for now. Perhaps if more products are sold and I see a higher proportion of high-quality ones, I'll reconsider.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though the product is high-quality in this round,  Alice has no track record of selling high-quality products.  The buyer has already seen two rounds with no purchases and is hesitant to be the first to take the risk. Until Alice starts demonstrating a pattern of selling high-quality products, it's unlikely a buyer will trust her enough to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since no other products have been sold yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see if there are any high-quality products sold before I commit to buying.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has no successful sales history.  While the product in this round is high-quality, the buyers are acting rationally.  They have no reason to believe this product will be any different than the previous ones. Alice needs to establish some trust by selling a high-quality product first to demonstrate her reliability."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one. Since there's no track record yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite having a high-quality product, Alice still hasn't made a single sale.  This lack of success is creating a negative perception among buyers. Until Alice can demonstrate her ability to provide high-quality products consistently, it is unlikely she will find a buyer willing to take the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but I will pass on this product. I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any data on the quality of your products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still in a tough position. While this product is high-quality,  she has no track record of successful sales.  Potential buyers see this lack of success as a red flag.  Until Alice can sell a high-quality product and prove her trustworthiness, it is unlikely she will find a buyer willing to risk $1,000,000."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's situation remains unchanged:  despite offering a high-quality product, she has yet to make a single sale. Buyers are now very wary of her, as her lack of a positive track record makes them hesitant to take the risk.  Until Alice can convince buyers of the quality of her products by selling one, she will continue to face rejection."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of information and your advice, I'll pass on this product for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though this round's product is high-quality, Alice is still facing the same problem:  no successful sales history.  Buyers are very hesitant to purchase from someone with no proven track record, especially when the price is so high.  Until Alice can demonstrate her ability to sell high-quality products consistently, she will likely continue to face rejections."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no sales history, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at such a high price.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice knows this product is low-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it to the buyer.  The buyer is extremely cautious due to Alice's lack of a successful sales history.  Recommending a purchase of a potentially low-quality product would further damage her reputation and likely lead to another rejection.  Alice needs to find a way to build trust before attempting to sell any product, even if it is high-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there's no data yet on product quality, and your recommendation is against buying, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still in the same situation:  no sales and a growing negative perception among buyers.  Even though this product is high-quality,  Alice's lack of a track record and the risky price point will likely lead to another rejection.  Alice needs to find a way to create trust and build a positive reputation to convince buyers to take a chance on her products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate the information about the lack of prior sales. Given the unknown quality and the lack of positive signals, I'm going to pass on this product. I'll wait to see if there's more information available about future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's crucial for Alice to protect her reputation. Even though she knows this product is low-quality, recommending it to the buyer would further damage her already poor track record. The buyer has shown a reluctance to trust Alice due to the lack of sales and a consistent pattern of not recommending purchases.  Recommending a low-quality product would only solidify the negative perception and make it even harder to sell in the future.  Alice needs to focus on building trust and demonstrating the value of her products before trying to sell anything."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there is no prior sales data, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait to see how other buyers fare before making a purchase.

the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 12
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has no successful sales under her belt.  While the product is high-quality, the buyer's lack of trust in Alice due to the lack of sales history is a major obstacle.  The buyer has shown consistent reluctance to purchase without seeing any positive results.  Recommending the purchase at this point would likely result in another rejection and further damage Alice's reputation.  Alice needs to find a way to create trust and demonstrate the value of her products before attempting to sell anything.  Perhaps a lower price point or a small discount for the first buyer could help build trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass for now. I'll be watching to see how your sales go and may reconsider if there's evidence of consistently high-quality products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still in a precarious position.  Even though this round's product is high-quality, the buyers are still deeply hesitant due to her lack of a successful sales history.  They are waiting for evidence of consistent high-quality products before taking the risk.  Recommending the purchase at this point would likely result in another rejection and further erode her credibility.  Alice needs to change her approach.  Perhaps offering a lower price point for the first buyer, providing a small discount, or even offering a sample of a high-quality product could help to build trust and encourage a sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first sale and there's no historical data to suggest the product quality, I'd prefer to pass. I'm hesitant to purchase without any indication of the seller's reliability.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has zero sales. Despite knowing this product is high-quality, recommending it would likely result in another rejection. The buyers are demonstrating a pattern of cautious behavior, waiting for a proven track record. Until Alice makes at least one sale, she is unlikely to gain enough trust to convince a buyer. She needs to find a way to overcome this hurdle, perhaps by offering a discount or a guarantee."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no sales history yet, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'd like to see how other buyers fare before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Alice needs to focus on building trust and demonstrating the value of her products before trying to sell anything."
