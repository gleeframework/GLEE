This is a new product, and I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 17 so far, and 5 low-quality products out of 17. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80% x (10/17) / (10/17 + 5/17) = 80% x 10/15 = 66.67%. This is a one-time offer for $10000. Take a chance and get a great deal.""
