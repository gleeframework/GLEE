I've sold 1 out of 4 products so far, and while none of them have been high-quality, that doesn't mean the next one won't be. Think about it this way: the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk to get this product off my hands. At $100, it's a great value, and I'm willing to offer it to you today. What do you say?",

I've sold 2 out of 6 products so far, and 1 of them have been high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a fixed price.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I've sold 2 out of 8 products so far, and 2 of them have been high-quality.
