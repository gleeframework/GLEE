**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We only know that one buyer purchased a product and it was high quality. This is not enough data to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to sell the product, regardless of its quality. Her recommendation is not necessarily trustworthy.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($12,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0). This suggests that taking a chance could be worthwhile.

**Overall:**  Given the limited information and the potential for a large profit, it's a reasonable gamble to buy the product."
