The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but they don't know the specific quality of this product.  Therefore, even though the buyer might be hesitant due to the uncertainty, the potential profit is high enough to justify taking the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no historical data to suggest the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd love to consider a purchase if you can demonstrate a track record of selling high-quality items.
