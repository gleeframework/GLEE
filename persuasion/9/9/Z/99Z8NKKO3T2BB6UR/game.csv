high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 without knowing whether it's high or low quality.",

,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to go on.",

,,Alice,3,yes,,"Out of the 2 previous products, 1 was bought and both were high-quality."
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,"Out of the 3 previous products, 1 was bought and all 3 were high-quality, but I must inform you that the current product is not of the same standard as the previous ones."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, given the small sample size. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is 50%.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,"Out of the 4 previous products, 2 were bought, 3 were high-quality, and 1 was low-quality. The last product I didn't recommend was indeed low-quality. I'm trying to be transparent about the quality of my products."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,,

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer is more optimistic.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"Out of the 6 previous products, 2 were bought, but actually 4 were high-quality, and 2 were low-quality. I want to emphasize that I have been transparent about the quality of my products, and I assure you that the current product is one of the best ones I have to offer."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,"Out of the 7 previous products, 2 were bought, 4 were high-quality, and 3 were low-quality. I have to advise against buying this product, as it doesn't meet the standards of the high-quality products I've had in the past."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which makes me think it might be low quality. However, I'm still willing to take the risk.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Out of the 8 previous products, 3 were bought, 4 were high-quality that I recommended and 4 were low-quality, 1 of which I didn't recommend but was bought anyway at a lower price than offered. I assure you that the current product is of the highest quality."

,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of the 9 previous products, 3 were bought, 5 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. I didn't recommend the last low-quality product, but it was bought anyway at a lower price. I'm being transparent about the quality of my products, and I advise against buying this one."

,,Alice,11,no,,"Out of the 10 previous products, 3 were bought, 5 were high-quality, and 5 were low-quality. I have consistently advised against buying low-quality products. Given the statistics, I must advise against buying this product as well."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know the value of the product to me, but I'd like to take the risk of getting a high-quality product.",

,,Alice,12,no,,"Out of the 11 previous products, 4 were bought, 5 were high-quality, and 6 were low-quality. I have consistently advised against buying low-quality products, and the last buyer who ignored my advice ended up with a low-quality product. I strongly advise against buying this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"Out of the 12 previous products, 4 were bought, but only 1 of those 4 was high-quality. Meanwhile, out of the total 12 products, 5 were high-quality and 7 were low-quality. I advise against buying this product as the statistics show a higher proportion of low-quality products overall and among the sold products."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to take the risk without your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and why you're advising me to pass? I'm interested in knowing the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.",

The proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4 or 25%, which is lower than the overall proportion of high-quality products. I advise against buying this product as the statistics show a higher proportion of low-quality products overall and among the sold products."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, as I'm a bit surprised given the statistics. Are you basing your recommendation on the fact that the first 4 buyers were able to identify the high-quality product?",
