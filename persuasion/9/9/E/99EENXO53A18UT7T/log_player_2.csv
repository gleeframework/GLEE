{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first product, there's no historical data to rely on. The only information we have is Alice's recommendation and the general probability of a product being high quality (80%).  

* **Risk:** There's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be a total loss.
* **Reward:** There's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which yields a $20 profit ($120 value - $100 price).

Considering the higher probability of getting a high-quality product and the potential profit, it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** There's not enough information to make a purely statistical decision.  We know one high-quality product was sold, but we don't know how many were offered (and potentially rejected).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  While not perfect, she likely has some insight into the product's quality that we don't.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain (worth $120 to you) outweighs the potential loss (worth $0). 

**It's a gamble, but given Alice's recommendation and the potential for a good profit, it's worth taking the risk.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the recommendation! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 3 out of 3 products being high-quality, the seller's recommendation seems very reliable.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Limited Opportunity:**  If you pass, the product is discarded, meaning you lose the opportunity to buy it entirely.

Therefore, it's a good bet to buy the product."
