Would you like to be one of the first to get your hands on it?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the exclusive offer, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for another potentially low-quality product at a 'discounted' price. I'm starting to think that you're trying to get rid of products that aren't selling well, and I'd rather wait for a more transparent offer.",no
