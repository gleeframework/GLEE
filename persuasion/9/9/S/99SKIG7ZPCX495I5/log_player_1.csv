Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

Even though we don't know the specific value the buyer places on the product, the information we do have makes recommending the purchase a good strategy:

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is high-quality, increasing the likelihood of the buyer finding it valuable.
* **Previous Sale:**  We successfully sold a high-quality product in the previous round. This positive outcome strengthens the buyer's belief that the product is likely to be worth the price. 

This information should encourage the buyer to buy, making recommending the purchase a sound decision."

With a consistent record of high-quality products, recommending the purchase is the logical choice. The buyer is likely to be optimistic about the value of the product, based on the previous rounds' outcomes."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'll also keep in mind the probability of it being high-quality (80%) and the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality, which might be a coincidence or a pattern.

```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's message shows they are still aware of the potential for a low-quality product (20% chance) but they are also demonstrating trust in the seller.  

Here's why recommending the purchase is still the best strategy:

* **High-Quality Product:**  This product is confirmed as high-quality.
