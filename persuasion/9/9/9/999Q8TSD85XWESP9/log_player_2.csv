I'm confident you'll love it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the confidence boost, Alice. Based on my experience with the last product, I trust your judgement.

It's not just a matter of finding a use for it, but it's actually a product that's not even worth the $100 I'm asking for. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm only doing it because I need to clear out some inventory.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That sounds like a fantastic deal, Alice! With the guarantee, I feel more secure in taking this opportunity. I'm confident in your products, but the added assurance makes it even more appealing. Let's go for it!""}"
