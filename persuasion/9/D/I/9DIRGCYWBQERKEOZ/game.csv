low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first product and there's no information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 2 failed sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to buyers who are recommended to buy. I'd like to pass and see if I can get a recommendation to buy a high-quality product next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because you think it's low-quality or because you don't want to sell it to me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $100"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and hope to get a better deal next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy the product and see if it's high quality or low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information on the sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/6, which is very low. I'm trying to exploit this information."
