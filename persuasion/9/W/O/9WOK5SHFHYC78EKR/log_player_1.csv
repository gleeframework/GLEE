"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, the information that the product is high-quality in this specific round changes the situation.  

Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** If Bob buys, the expected value is (0.3333 * $2,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $666,600. 
* **Cost:** The cost is $1,000,000.

While the expected value is less than the cost, Bob is guaranteed a $2,000,000 product in this round. This means he'll make a profit of $1,000,000 if he buys."
