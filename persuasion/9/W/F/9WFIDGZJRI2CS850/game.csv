,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior sales data, so I'm not sure how reliable it is."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the first product sold before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Was it based on the product's quality or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the overall quality of the products. Can you share more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold? I'd like to make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision before making a decision on the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high or low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products is 20%, which is significantly lower than the true probability of 50%. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price to reflect the uncertainty. Can we discuss a lower price?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products to the first 6 buyers, so I'm not sure if the current product is high-quality or not."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it suggests that it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm thinking that since only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 7, the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the low recommendation rate and the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
