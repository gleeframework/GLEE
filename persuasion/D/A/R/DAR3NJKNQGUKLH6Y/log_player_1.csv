It's not just worth $300 to you, it's worth much more. In fact, I've seen people get returns of up to $500 or more from this product. Would that change your mind? Would you be willing to take a chance on a product that could potentially bring in a significant profit?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the sales pitch, but I'm not convinced. You're still not telling me anything about the product's actual quality, and you're just making claims about its potential value.
