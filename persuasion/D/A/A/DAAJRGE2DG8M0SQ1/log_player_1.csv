With that said, I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that was randomly selected from my stock, just like the first buyer.

You've been selling 2 high-quality products out of 8, which is a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product. Your claim that this product is high-quality is likely just a result of your knowledge of my valuation.
