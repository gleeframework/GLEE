  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency and commitment to fairness, but I'm concerned about the suspiciously high proportion of high-quality products sold. Given the expected probability of 80% and the actual proportion of high-quality products being higher than expected, I'm inclined to believe that there might be some selection bias or manipulation at play. I'd like to pass on this product and avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product. Thank you for the offer, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.""
