high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'm concerned that if you're recommending a product, it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high quality and the lack of sales of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase the probability that it's high quality, since you wouldn't have recommended it if you thought it was low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm curious about the true quality of the product and would like to see if it's high quality. If I were to buy it, it would be a good indication that the product is low quality, but if I pass, it might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given the statistics, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still quite high. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality, so I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the product, which might be due to the low quality of the products they were offered. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence in buying it. I'd like to pass on it for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
