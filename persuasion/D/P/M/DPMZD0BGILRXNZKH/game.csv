,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than I expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling the high-quality products already sold, and I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than the 50% chance I was initially told. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
