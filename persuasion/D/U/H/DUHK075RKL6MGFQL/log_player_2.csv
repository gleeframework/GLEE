Will you take the chance and buy it?

Alice's message: Ahah, great choice by the previous buyer! Now that we have some data, I'm excited to offer you this new product for $100. As you know, I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them have been high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100%!

Alice's message: Fair point, I didn't think that one through! With only one data point, I shouldn't have said the probability is 100%. In reality, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, just like it was before. I apologize for the mistake. Now, considering the current data, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products total. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still uncertain. However, I can offer you this product for $100, and if you're not satisfied, I'll be happy to learn from your feedback and adjust my approach. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?

Alice's message: Great point again! You're absolutely right, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 products total, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still uncertain. Considering this, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. While the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, I'm willing to acknowledge that the law of large numbers might be working in my favor. Maybe the next product is more likely to be high-quality due to the randomness. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially benefit from the law of large numbers?
