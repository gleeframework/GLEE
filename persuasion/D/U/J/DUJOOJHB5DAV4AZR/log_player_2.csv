**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very limited information about the products. There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This doesn't tell us much about the overall quality distribution.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a significant factor. She knows the true quality and is incentivized to make recommendations that benefit her (selling more products). While this doesn't guarantee a high-quality product, it increases the likelihood.
* **Potential Upside:** Even with a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) is substantial. 

**Taking the Risk:** Given the potential reward and the lack of strong evidence against buying, taking a calculated risk with this purchase seems reasonable."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This significantly increases the likelihood of it being high-quality.

While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the information available strongly suggests that this specific product is high-quality. The potential reward of $1,250,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
