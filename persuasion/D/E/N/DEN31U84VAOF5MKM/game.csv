,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'm doing it against her advice."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy, and none of the high-quality products were sold, I suspect that all the previous products were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be risking $1000000 on a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice, but since she's not recommending it, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one."
