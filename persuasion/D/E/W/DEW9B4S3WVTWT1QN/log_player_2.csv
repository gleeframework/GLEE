"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). It's always a gamble, but in the long run, buying all recommended products will likely lead to a higher profit."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Maybe next time!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she doesn't know the true value of the product to you, her recommendation likely stems from some internal knowledge about the product's quality.
