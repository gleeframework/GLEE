"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this round's product is high-quality. While I don't know the buyer's valuation of a high-quality product, the potential for a large profit makes it worth recommending a purchase. The buyer also knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, so there's a decent chance they'll value it enough to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer passed, the situation hasn't changed for me. This product is still high-quality, and the buyer is still aware of the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. My strategy remains the same: recommend the purchase with the hope that the buyer will value the product enough to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear: the buyers are basing their decision solely on the initial probability of a high-quality product (33.33%) and the lack of a sales record. They are not factoring in the fact that the product is indeed high-quality. Therefore, I will continue to recommend the purchase, hoping that eventually, a buyer will make a decision based on their own valuation rather than just the statistics."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The situation remains unchanged. The buyers are consistently ignoring the actual quality of the product and only relying on the initial probability. I will continue to recommend the purchase in hopes of attracting a buyer who will consider the potential value of a high-quality product."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the previous buyers consistently refusing to buy, the strategy remains the same. This product is high-quality, and the buyer is still unaware of this fact.  I will continue to recommend the purchase hoping to eventually find a buyer willing to take a chance based on the potential value."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, I choose not to take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time I've encountered a low-quality product. I know that the buyer values low-quality products at $0. Since I'm not allowed to offer discounts, there's no way for the buyer to benefit from purchasing this product.  Therefore, I will not recommend the purchase."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has already shown a pattern of being risk-averse, refusing to buy even when the product is high-quality. Since this product is low-quality and known to be worth $0 to the buyer, there is no chance for the buyer to benefit from buying it. Even though I haven't sold any products yet, the buyer is unlikely to change their behavior. Therefore, I will not recommend the purchase."
