If I were to sell this product to you, I'd be willing to give you a 50% refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. But, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the value that this product can bring to you.

I'm willing to let it go for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price.

Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you - it's not as high-quality as the last one. However, I've been thinking, and I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your strategy, and I respect your patience. However, I want to offer you a different perspective. Since you're not interested in buying this low-quality product, I'll ask you a question: if you were to get a high-quality product in a future round, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? If your answer is yes, then I'd like to offer you a deal. I'll give you this low-quality product for $4000, and you can keep the option to swap it for a high-quality product in a future round. If you're not willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, then I think it's best to wait for a better opportunity.
