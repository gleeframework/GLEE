Alice's message: You've just seen that I sold a product for $9000, and you know it was high-quality. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have 18 more chances to sell a high-quality product. I'd like to point out that the price I'm offering today is the same as the price I offered in the previous round. Considering the value you place on high-quality products is $40000, I'm offering a fair deal. If you're interested, I'll give you a 5% discount if you buy this product now. That's a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer it again. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the 5% discount offer, I need to consider the overall probability of the product being high-quality and the price offered. Given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and the large difference between its potential value to me ($40,000) and the asking price ($10,000), I'll take a pass on this one. I'll be watching your future sales to see if the odds change in my favor.""}"

This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer it again. If you're interested, I'll give you a 10% discount on this high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I don't think the odds are as much in my favor as you claim. With only one sale so far, the sample size is too small to make any conclusions about the probability of a product being high-quality. I'll need to see more data before I can make an informed decision. Plus, even with a 10% discount, the price is still quite high considering the uncertainty. I'll have to pass on this one.""}"

I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $10000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and help me break the streak.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although I appreciate the discount, I don't think the reduced price of $8000 is low enough to justify purchasing a product that is likely to be of low quality, especially considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, not 25% as you mentioned, and you revealed this product is low-quality.""}"
