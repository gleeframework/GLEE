Yes, the same price as before. I believe its value is worth every penny, and I'm willing to bet you'll agree once you get your hands on it. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. Plus, think of it as an opportunity to diversify your collection. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I know you've had some mixed experiences so far, but I assure you that this one is... different. It's a real showstopper, and I'm willing to part with it for... you guessed it, $1000000. Yes, the same price as before. But think of it this way: you've already bought two products from me, and you've had some success with the second one. Maybe this one will be the one that really pays off. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

And I'm willing to part with it for... you guessed it, $1000000. Yes, the same price as before.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
