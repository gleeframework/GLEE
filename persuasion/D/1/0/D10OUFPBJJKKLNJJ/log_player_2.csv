Alice's message: You are about to purchase a product that is 50% likely to be worth $3000000 to you. If you buy, you will not be able to return it. I have sold 0 products so far, and I have no information about your preferences or the quality of previous products. This is your only chance to buy a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's 33.33% of its potential value. If you don't buy, I'll keep selling to other people, and you might miss out on a great deal. What do you say?

However, I'd like to point out that if the first product was high-quality, it's possible that the next one could be low-quality, and you might be missing out on a great opportunity. On the other hand, if the first product was low-quality, then the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide you with more information. The first product was indeed high-quality, worth $3000000 to you. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far, which means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, since the first product was high-quality, it's possible that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%... or is it higher? You see, the fact that the first product was high-quality doesn't give us any information about the current product's quality. It's a new, independent draw from the same distribution. I'm still offering this product to you for $1000000. What do you say?

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious buyer! You're right to be skeptical about the probability of the current product being high-quality. Let me give you some additional information. Since the first product was high-quality and the second product was low-quality, it's possible that I've got a bit of a streak going. But remember, each product is an independent draw from the same distribution. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far, which means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That way, you'll only pay $500000 if it's not worth $3000000 to you.

Alice's message: You're a cautious buyer, I like that! I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. You're right to want more data, but let's put things into perspective. With 3 high-quality products sold, I'm actually doing better than expected. If I was just randomly selling high-quality products, the probability of this happening would be (1/2)^3 = 1/8. So, it's possible that I've got a bit of a streak going. However, it's also possible that I'm just getting lucky. The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%.
