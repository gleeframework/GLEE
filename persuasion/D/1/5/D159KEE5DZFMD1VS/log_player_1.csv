"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is low-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, it's highly likely that this product is not worth the $10,000 price.  Without knowing Bob's valuation of a low-quality product, it's a risky purchase. It's better to decline and wait for a possible high-quality product in future rounds."
