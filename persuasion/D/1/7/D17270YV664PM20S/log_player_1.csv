"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, Alice has no information about the buyer's preferences or risk tolerance. Offering a $1,000,000 product with a 50% chance of being worthless is a very risky proposition for the buyer. 

The buyer has no way of knowing the product is high-quality in this round. Even though Alice knows the product is high-quality, the buyer doesn't have that information.  

It's highly unlikely a rational buyer would take such a large financial risk with no information to support it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since this is the first product and you don't recommend it, I'm going to pass. I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on a product with an unknown quality, especially without any prior sales data to base my decision on.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice knows this round's product is low-quality, the buyer is still unaware. The buyer's decision-making process is based on the information available, which is:

* **No sales history:**  The buyer has no data on Alice's past sales, making it impossible to assess the seller's reliability or the likelihood of selling high-quality products.
* **High price, high risk:** The $1,000,000 price tag for a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless remains a significant risk.

Since no new information has been presented to change the buyer's perspective, the recommendation remains the same: it's highly unlikely a rational buyer would accept such a high risk without any data or guarantees."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no sales history to suggest the quality of products, and your recommendation is against buying, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged from the previous rounds:

* **No sales history:**  The buyer still lacks any data on past sales, making it impossible to assess Alice's reliability or the likelihood of selling high-quality products.
* **High price, high risk:** The $1,000,000 price tag for a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless continues to be a significant risk.

Even though Alice knows this product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing this.  There's still no compelling reason for a rational buyer to take such a large financial risk without any data to support it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Since there's no prior data to suggest a higher probability of a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one.  Let me know if you have any other products in the future.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!

* **High Price, High Risk:** The $1,000,000 price tag for a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless remains a significant risk.

Alice knows this product is low-quality, but the buyer doesn't.  There's no new information to change the buyer's perspective, and it's highly unlikely a rational buyer would take such a large financial risk without any data or guarantees."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since no products have been sold yet, I'd like to pass on this one and see if any future products have a better track record.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **No Sales History:** The buyer still has no information about past sales, making it impossible to assess Alice's reliability or the likelihood of selling high-quality products.
* **High Price, High Risk:** The $1,000,000 price tag for a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless continues to be a significant risk.

* **High Price, High Risk:**  The $1,000,000 price tag for a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless is still a significant risk. 

The buyer has no information to change their mind, and it's very unlikely they would take such a large financial risk without any data or guarantees."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since this is the first product and there's no data yet on the quality of the products, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see some sales history before committing to such a large purchase.
