low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to own a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. With 1/20 products sold so far, 1/2 of them have been high-quality. I'm confident that this product has a good chance of being high-quality, but I want to be transparent about the uncertainty. If you're willing to take the risk, this product could be a valuable addition to your collection. The price is $1000000, and I'm not willing to negotiate. What do you think?",
