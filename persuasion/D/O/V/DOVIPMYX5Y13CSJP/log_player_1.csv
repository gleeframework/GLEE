Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000, which is 20% below the market value of similar high-quality products. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that it's worth $800000 to me. The product could be low quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.

}"
"Bob's message: The satisfaction guarantee is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm not sure the product is high-quality. I'd still be out $800000 if it turns out to be low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk.

}"

I'll also throw in a $200,000 bonus if you buy this product and decide to buy the future product at the discounted price.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced. The 'priority access' offer sounds like it's worth something, but I'm not sure if the future product will be worth buying at a 10% discount. I'd rather wait and see what the future product is before making a decision.
