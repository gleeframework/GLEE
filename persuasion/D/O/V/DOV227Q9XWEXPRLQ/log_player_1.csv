"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 50%.** This means there's a 50% chance the product is worth $1,200,000 and a 50% chance it's worth $0. 
* **The product is being sold for $1,000,000.** 
* **Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the expected value of the product is positive:** 
    * (0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000
* **This expected value is higher than the purchase price.**  Therefore, it's financially advantageous for Bob to buy the product, even with the uncertainty."

* **The current product is high-quality.** Bob still has a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Even with the risk of being misled again, the expected value of the product is still positive:** 
    * (0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000
