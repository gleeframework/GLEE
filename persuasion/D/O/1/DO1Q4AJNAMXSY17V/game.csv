high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,

I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher."
