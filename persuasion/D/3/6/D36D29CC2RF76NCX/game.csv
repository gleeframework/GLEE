,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the statistics?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'd like to know the updated probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be sold. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the average. I'd like to wait for the next product or have more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. However, considering the lack of successful sales, I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that the next buyer will take the product, and if they pass, I'll have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and there are no high-quality products sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality.
