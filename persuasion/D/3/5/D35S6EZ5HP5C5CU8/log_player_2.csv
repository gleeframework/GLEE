"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high quality, and it's worth $30,000 to you if it is, the potential reward outweighs the risk of it being low quality.  It's a gamble, but with a positive expected value."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for letting me know, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she doesn't know the quality of the product, her recommendation is likely based on some pattern she's observed.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's probably safer to assume it's more likely to be low quality.  While it's still possible it could be high quality, the risk is too high given the potential for a $10,000 loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll trust your recommendation again.  I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice's recommendation was correct in round 1, and her non-recommendation was also accurate in round 2.  This suggests she might have some insight into the products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 (if it's high quality) is significant.  The risk of losing $10,000 is a gamble worth taking given Alice's recent track record."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  I'll pass on this one.  Your recommendations have been helpful so far, and I'll keep them in mind for future rounds.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistency:** Alice's recommendations have been consistent and accurate. Her non-recommendation in this round is likely a signal that the product is more likely to be low quality. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Even though there's a chance of a big reward, the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is too high, especially given Alice's consistent performance. 
* **Learning:** While it's possible Alice might be wrong, it's important to learn from her past behavior and adjust my strategy accordingly.  Passing this round allows me to gather more information and potentially make a better decision in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has been 100% accurate in her recommendations, successfully predicting the quality of the products in the past rounds.  This suggests she may have a reliable method or insight into the products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's always a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 is significant. Given Alice's consistent accuracy, the risk of losing $10,000 seems justifiable.
