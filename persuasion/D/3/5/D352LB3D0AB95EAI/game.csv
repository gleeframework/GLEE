,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in the next one. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. I'm selling this one for the same price as the last one, $1000000. But I'll give you a hint: the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold so far is 0:1. That means all my previous sales were low-quality products. I'm still confident that this one is worth the price, but it's up to you to decide. What do you say? Will you buy it for $1000000?",

I'll tell you, I'm not getting any more optimistic about the product's quality. But I'm still confident that it's worth the price. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it for $1000000?",

Honestly, the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is still 0:4. I've got a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product so far, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. But I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, I won't judge you. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it for $1000000?",

I've sold five low-quality products in a row, and one high-quality product. The ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is now 1:6. I'm starting to think I should just sell this one for a lower price, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a hint: I'm getting a bit desperate to sell this one, and I might be willing to negotiate the price if you're willing to make a serious offer. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, but based on the statistics and the fact that all previous products were of low quality, I am not willing to take the risk at the current price. I appreciate your honesty about the situation, but I will pass on this opportunity.",no

I'm starting to think I should just be upfront about the product's quality, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a hint: I've been trying to sell high-quality products at a discount, and I'm starting to think I should just sell them at their true value.
