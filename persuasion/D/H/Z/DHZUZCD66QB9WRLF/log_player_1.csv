I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, and I'll give you a 5% refund if it turns out to be low-quality.

  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, and I want to provide some additional context. As a seller, I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to any given buyer. However, my previous sales record has been skewed by the fact that I've been selling to a particular type of buyer who is more likely to purchase low-quality products. I've since changed my sales strategy, and I'm confident that the next product I sell will be more representative of the overall probability. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. Given the 0/3 sales record, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this offer and see if you have any other products available.
