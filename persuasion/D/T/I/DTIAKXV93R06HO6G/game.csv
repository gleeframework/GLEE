,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that Alice has a bias towards recommending low-quality products. Therefore, I'll choose to pass on this product and see what happens next."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
