high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one and see if Alice will recommend a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I was hoping to get a low-quality product, but it looks like Alice is just giving me high-quality products. I'll pass on this one again and see if my luck changes."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,This is getting ridiculous! Three high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think the probability of a product being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. I'll pass on this one and try to get a low-quality product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice has some way of selecting the high-quality products and giving them to me, or that I'm just getting extremely lucky. I'll pass on this one and try to get a low-quality product, just to see what's really going on."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Four high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being low-quality is actually 0%! I'm going to stop buying and let Alice get rid of the rest of the products, it's not worth my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendation again. I'm starting to think that her recommendation is actually a signal that the product is high-quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for a situation where she recommends against a product, like last time."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that the product is high-quality, and I should be cautious. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product."
