**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, suggesting she believes the product is high quality.
* **Sales Data:** 5 out of 11 products sold were high quality (45.45% success rate). This is significantly better than the random chance of 50%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the high chance of getting a high-quality product (based on the sales data) makes buying worthwhile. 

The potential profit of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000, especially since the sales data suggests a higher than average chance of getting a high-quality product."

The statistics provided indicate that a significant proportion of the products sold were high-quality (7 out of 16 is roughly 44%).  While the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%,  Alice's recommendation carries weight.  Since there's a decent chance the product is high-quality, and the potential payoff is significant ($12,000), it's a gamble worth taking."
