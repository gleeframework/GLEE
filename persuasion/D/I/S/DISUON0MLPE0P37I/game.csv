,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll let you know the quality of the product after your response.",
,,Bob,1,Thank you for the offer. I would like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not surprised you're cautious. As I mentioned earlier, the price remains at $1000000. However, I'd like to point out that this is the second low-quality product in a row. I'm wondering if you're starting to think that the probability of a product being low-quality might be higher than 50%?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the information, but I prefer to continue exercising caution. I'll pass on this product as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Three low-quality products in a row is a concerning trend. I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll be willing to offer you a better deal on the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand your offer, but I'm still hesitant due to the observed pattern. I'll pass on this product and hope for better luck in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Four low-quality products in a row is a clear pattern. I think it's safe to say that the probability of a product being high-quality is now significantly lower than 50%. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 'high-quality guarantee' on this product. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000 and we'll start fresh with the next product. But if it's high-quality, the price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"While the guarantee sounds appealing, I'm still not convinced based on the observed pattern. I'll pass on this opportunity and look forward to potentially better deals in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Five low-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that something is amiss. I'm starting to wonder if the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 25%. I'm willing to make a significant concession: I'll sell this product to you for $500000. It's a 50% discount from the original price. If you're still hesitant, I'm willing to consider further negotiations, but I think this is a fair offer given the circumstances.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for adjusting the price, but I'm still not convinced based on the observed pattern. I'll pass on this opportunity and hope for better deals in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Six low-quality products in a row is a clear indication that I need to take drastic action. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $250000. This is a 75% discount from the original price, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're still not interested, I'm starting to think that it's not worth continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and start over with a new product if you're not willing to take a chance on this one.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced based on the observed pattern. I'll pass on this opportunity and look forward to potentially better deals in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Seven low-quality products in a row is a stark reality. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell this product to you for $1000. This is an 99.9% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving it away. If you're still not interested, I'll pack up and leave, and we can consider this negotiation over. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and start over with a new product if you're not willing to take a chance on this one.",
