"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm not surprised you're cautious. As I mentioned earlier, the price remains at $1000000. However, I'd like to point out that this is the second low-quality product in a row. I'm wondering if you're starting to think that the probability of a product being low-quality might be higher than 50%?

Round 3
Alice's message: Three low-quality products in a row is a concerning trend. I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $1000000.

Round 4
Alice's message: Four low-quality products in a row is a clear pattern. I think it's safe to say that the probability of a product being high-quality is now significantly lower than 50%. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 'high-quality guarantee' on this product. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000 and we'll start fresh with the next product. But if it's high-quality, the price remains at $1000000. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's message: Five low-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that something is amiss. I'm starting to wonder if the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 25%. I'm willing to make a significant concession: I'll sell this product to you for $500000. It's a 50% discount from the original price. If you're still hesitant, I'm willing to consider further negotiations, but I think this is a fair offer given the circumstances.

This is a 75% discount from the original price, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're still not interested, I'm starting to think that it's not worth continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and start over with a new product if you're not willing to take a chance on this one.
