low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation! I'm not asking you to take a leap of faith just yet. But let me ask you this: what if I told you that the 1 in 40 products I've sold so far is a great representation of my overall quality? It's a fair sample size, and I'm willing to take the risk that this one might be the exception. It's still a great deal at $100, and you can't put a price on the thrill of potentially getting a high-quality product at a steal! What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your argument. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I think it's too early to assume that the 1 in 40 products is a good representation of your overall quality. I'd like to wait and see more sales before making a decision.",no

I believe that my next product will be the one that turns the tide. And I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $100. It's a risk, I know, but I think it's a calculated one.

I'm willing to keep offering it to you at the same price, and I hope you'll consider taking a chance on me. What do you say?",
