,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to verify its quality after purchase. If you buy it, I'll give you a special inspection report that will confirm its high-quality status. This way, you'll have complete confidence in your purchase. The price remains $100, but I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll get from this product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your offer. Even if I buy the product and get a special inspection report, I'll still have to pay $100 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'm not willing to pay a premium for a product that has a high chance of being worthless to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the probability of low-quality products. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you a 20-round guarantee. If, at the end of the 20 rounds, you haven't bought a high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund for the price of this product. You'll essentially get the product for free, and you'll have the opportunity to buy a high-quality product in the future. The price remains $100, but I believe it's a risk-free deal considering the potential reward.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee. Even with a 20-round guarantee, I'm still paying $100 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd have to buy 6 high-quality products in a row to break even, and that's highly unlikely. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not going to try to convince you to buy a product that's not worth it. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'll offer you a chance to get a high-quality product in the future. If you wait, I'll offer you the next high-quality product I have at a special price of $90. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal. Would you like to wait and consider the next high-quality product?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to wait for a potential future high-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round to make a decision.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I'm glad you're waiting for a high-quality one. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to make a special deal for you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $90. This is the lowest price I've ever offered for a high-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not willing to pay $90 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll stick to my original strategy and wait for the next round to make a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. Since this product is low-quality, I'll be upfront with you - it's not worth your money. I'm not going to try to sell it to you, and I'm willing to let it go for free. You can have it without paying a dime. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking a product that has no value to me. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product that I can actually benefit from.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to try to sell you this low-quality product. Instead, I'll make a prediction: I predict that the next product will be high-quality. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy the next product at the original price of $100, but if I'm wrong and the next product is low-quality, you can get a full refund. Would you like to take the risk and buy the next product at the original price?",
,,Bob,7,"I don't think it's a good idea to take the risk of buying a product at the original price with the promise of a refund if it's low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad I was wrong about the last product being high-quality, and this one is indeed a high-quality one. Considering your concerns about the probability, I'll make a counteroffer. I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, making it $50. This way, you'll be paying a lower price for a product that you know is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $50 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd have to pay $75 to break even, and I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I've been clear about the quality of the products, and you've made it clear about your concerns. Since this product is low-quality, I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'll offer you a deal: if you wait for the next 5 rounds and don't buy any products, I'll give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product I have at the price you're willing to pay, which is $75. You can get the high-quality product at a price that you think is fair. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in taking a low-quality product, and I'm willing to wait for the next 5 rounds to see if I can get a high-quality product at a price I'm willing to pay. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're waiting for the next 5 rounds to get a high-quality product at a price you're willing to pay. I'll make a deal with you: I'll give you a heads up when I have a high-quality product available. I'll send you a message saying 'High-Quality Product Available' and you can buy it at the price you're willing to pay, which is $75. You can then make an informed decision. Would you like me to send you a notification when the high-quality product is available?",

I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, making it $70, and I'll throw in a bonus feature that's not available on any other product. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an even better deal. What do you think?",

,,Alice,14,"You're waiting for a refund, and I'm not going to try to sell you this low-quality product. Since this is the second low-quality product in a row, I'll give you an additional incentive.
