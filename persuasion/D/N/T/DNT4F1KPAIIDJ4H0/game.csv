low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of a product being high quality is 0.5, but with 4 failed attempts, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on the product."

,,Alice,14,no,

Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products recommended by Alice, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality.
