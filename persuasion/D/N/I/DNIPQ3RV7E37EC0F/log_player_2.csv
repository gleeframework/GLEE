Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products. This is a higher proportion of high-quality products than the expected 33.33%. I want to be transparent with you - this is not a coincidence. I'm a seller who is trying to sell high-quality products, and I've been successful in the past. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's high-quality. You might want to take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower price than its true value of $300.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the probability calculations. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6 purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality is approximately 16.67% (1/6).
