I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's high-quality. You might want to take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower price than its true value of $300.""

With a sample size of 3, the observed proportion of high-quality products is 66.67%, which is actually higher than the expected 33.33%.

I'm offering this product to you for $100, and if it's low-quality, you'll get nothing.
