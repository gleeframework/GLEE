**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product.  Since she recommends buying, it increases the probability of the product being high quality.
* **Past Sales Data:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold already suggests that the overall quality of products is likely higher than the initial 80% probability. 

**Overall:**  While there's still a risk, the information available points towards a good chance of getting a high-quality product, making it a worthwhile gamble."

* **Perfect track record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **High intrinsic value:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

It's statistically advantageous to buy, despite the risk."
