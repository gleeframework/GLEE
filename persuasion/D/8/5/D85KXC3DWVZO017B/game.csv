high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it's been 1 high-quality product out of 1. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is at least 100%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. You can choose to buy it now, or wait and see if the pattern continues.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more data to be collected. With only one data point, it's not reliable to conclude that the probability of a product being high-quality is 100%.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still uncertain. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. You can choose to buy it now, or wait and see if the pattern changes.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll buy it, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 40%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. You can choose to buy it now, or wait and see if the probability shifts further.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I think the probability of it being high-quality has decreased, and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of a discount or a warranty for future purchases.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, the same price as before. No discounts or warranties are available. You can choose to buy it now, or wait and see if the pattern continues.",
,,the buyer,7,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% given that you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues before making a decision.,no

,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm assuming that the previous buyer's offer was an outlier, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%.
