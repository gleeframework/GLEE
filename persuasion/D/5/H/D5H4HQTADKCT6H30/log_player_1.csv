As for increasing the chances of getting a high-quality product, I'm afraid there's no guarantee or way to manipulate the outcome. Each product is unique, and the quality is determined independently.

I'm not sure if this is due to chance or if there's an underlying bias. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one has a more representative proportion of high-quality products.

"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the previous results don't influence my decision.

As of now, we have 7 high-quality products sold out of 14 total products, and 7 products remaining. Since we've already sold 7 high-quality products, it's possible that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. However, each product is still randomly assigned as high-quality or low-quality, and the probability remains 50%. I want to assure you that we have no way to manipulate the outcome or influence the quality of the remaining products. The price of $10,000 is still a great opportunity, considering the potential value it could bring. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your reassurance that the quality of the remaining products is still random and not influenced.

The probability of the last 7 high-quality products being randomly distributed among the first 8 buyers is actually quite low. In fact, it's approximately 0.0000004%. This is because the probability of getting 7 high-quality products in a row by chance is extremely low. However, I want to reiterate that each product is still randomly assigned as high-quality or low-quality, and the probability remains 50%. The price of $10,000 is still a great opportunity, considering the potential value it could bring. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument. The probability of 7 high-quality products in a row is indeed low, but it doesn't change the underlying probability of the current product being high-quality or low-quality, which is still 50%.

You're right that the probability of the current product being high-quality or low-quality remains 50%. I want to respect your decision and acknowledge that you're not willing to take the risk. The price of $10,000 is indeed high, and it's reasonable to be hesitant. If you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I'm happy to offer you a different product or provide more information to help you make a more informed decision. What do you think? Would you like to explore other options or learn more about our products?""}"

As of now, we've sold a total of 18 products, and 9 of them have been high-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 9/18 or approximately 0.5 or 50%. I want to reiterate that each product is still randomly assigned as high-quality or low-quality, and the probability remains 50%. The price of $10,000 is still a great opportunity, considering the potential value it could bring. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is any higher than 50% just because 9 out of 18 products were high-quality. I'd like to see more data or a more compelling reason to change my perception of the 50% probability.
