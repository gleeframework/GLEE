,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the previous sales record and the fact that 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality. Is there a pattern or a reason behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to go against the advice and buy the product. I'm thinking that since the previous buyers didn't know the quality of the product when they made their decision, they might have been influenced by the recommendation. I'm taking a chance that the product might be high-quality, and I'm willing to pay $100 for it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.
