,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. If you're not willing to take a chance on it for $500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. Alright, let me sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. That's a $100000 value, absolutely free. So, I'll let you have this product for $700000. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"Excellent decision on the previous product, Bob! I'm glad you're satisfied. Now, let's talk about this next product.

This product is a high-quality one, and I think you'll be very pleased with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a premium price, but I think it's worth it.

With that in mind, I'm willing to make a concession on this product. I'll sell it to you for $600000, which is below my costs, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you've already gotten from the previous products.
