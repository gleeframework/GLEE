Alice's message: I understand you're waiting to see other options.

I'm willing to throw in a complimentary upgrade worth $20000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this product available.

It's a product that I've had in stock for a while and I'm looking to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this product may not meet your expectations. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line product, I'd be happy to hold onto it and offer it to you in a future round.
