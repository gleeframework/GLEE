**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, is not recommending it. This is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.
* **Sales History:** Only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 purchase. This suggests a very high likelihood of low-quality products in the pool.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $3,000,000 is great, but the risk of getting a worthless product is much higher. It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."
