low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and the probability of a low-quality product is still relatively high."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 out of 1 buyers purchasing a product, and none of them being high-quality, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the third buyer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the average. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price due to the lack of recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, it suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. This information makes me more cautious and inclined to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems the products Alice has offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal or get more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
