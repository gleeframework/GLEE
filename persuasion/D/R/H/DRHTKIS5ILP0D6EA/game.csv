,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice recommends the product, I'm suspicious that it might be a low-quality product. With a 66.67% chance of being low quality, and the fact that Alice has recommended it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the reason behind Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the poor track record of high-quality products being sold so far."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think I should buy this product? Also, can you share the total number of products offered and the total number of products sold so far?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a specific reason you don't think this product is worth buying?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, I suspect that all the sold products might have been low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the previous buyers were just following Alice's recommendations, which might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially given. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's likely a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this seems to be a biased sample. I'd like to wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to assume the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."
