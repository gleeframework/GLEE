**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:** 100% of the products sold have been high quality. This is a very strong signal that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you. Recommending a low-quality product would ultimately hurt her future sales, as you wouldn't trust her recommendations again.  
* **Limited Opportunity:**  If you pass, the product is discarded. There's a chance you might miss out on a high-quality product.

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the strong evidence from Alice's past recommendations makes buying the product the more rational choice."
