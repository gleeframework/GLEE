Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I can tell! You've probably heard about my excellent track record, and you're wondering why I'm offering this product at such a low price.

Alice's message: I completely understand your concern! As a transparent seller, I'm happy to share that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I've sold 1 low-quality product. That means that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to remind you that the value of a high-quality product is $3000000, and you can't put a price on the satisfaction of owning one. This product is available for $1000000, a steal considering its potential value. What do you say?
