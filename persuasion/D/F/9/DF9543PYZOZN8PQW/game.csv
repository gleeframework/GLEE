,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a good deal."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or consider buying a product after more data is available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because I'm aware of the statistics and the probabilities. Since 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased. However, the probability is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
