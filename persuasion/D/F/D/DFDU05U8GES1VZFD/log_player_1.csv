"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, but since you've revealed that the product I'm being offered has 80% chance of being high-quality and 20% chance of being low-quality, and given that you're asking for $10000 while a high-quality product is worth $30000 to me and a low-quality product is worth $0, I'll take a pass on this one since I don't have any information about the product you are offering me that would change its 80% chance of being high-quality and I don't see any reason to trust your recommendation.
