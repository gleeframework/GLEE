Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I still have 19 products left. I'd like to point out that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. On the other hand, if you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell the next product at the same price of $10000, without any additional incentives. So, I'm offering you a 'buy now' option for this low-quality product at $10000, and you can decide whether to take it or wait for the next product.
