Alice's message: I understand your concern about the law of large numbers. Let me provide more context. Before the previous buyer purchased the high-quality product, I had sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 total products offered. The probability of a product being high-quality was 33.33%. Now, with 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products offered, the probability is indeed 66.67%. However, I want to emphasize that the previous buyer's purchase was a single data point, and the true probability of a product being high-quality could still be 33.33%.
