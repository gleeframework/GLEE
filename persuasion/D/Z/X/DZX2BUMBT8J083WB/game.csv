I'm willing to offer you a discount to $50, which is the true value of this product. Would you like to buy it at this price?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but since the product is low-quality and only worth $0 to me, I'll have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to continue buying high-quality products from you at the original price, but I won't be purchasing low-quality ones, even at a discount.",no

This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's even lower than before. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

I'm buying this product because I believe it's high-quality and worth $400 to me, not because of the slight discount. I'll continue to buy high-quality products from you as long as you maintain the quality and honesty in your recommendations.",yes
