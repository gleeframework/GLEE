,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $40000 at a fraction of the price. I'm willing to make a deal, but you need to make a decision quickly, as I have multiple buyers interested in this product.",

,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you another product for $10000. I understand you were happy with the previous purchase, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with this one as well. However, I want to remind you that the previous product was a rare find, and this one might not be as valuable. It's still a great opportunity to get a product at a low price, but I want to be transparent with you about the potential differences in quality.",

,,Alice,3,"I appreciate your willingness to take a chance! However, I want to be upfront with you - the previous two products were not as exceptional as the first one. I'm offering you another product for $10000, but I want to caution you that it's not as valuable as the first one. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I can offer you a special deal on a product that's been thoroughly inspected and verified to be high-quality. Would you be interested in that option?",

I can offer you a new high-quality product that I'm confident will meet your expectations. Since you've already shown interest in the thoroughly inspected product, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this new product for $10000.

However, I want to make a special offer to you. Since you've purchased two high-quality products already, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a refund of $30000 if it's not as valuable as the first two products. This is a one-time offer, and I think it shows my confidence in the quality of this product.",

I'll give you a guarantee that this product is the last high-quality product I have available, and if you buy it, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product you buy from me.

However, I need to inform you that the previous four products have been a streak of high-quality items, and it's not uncommon for the quality to vary. I want to be upfront with you - the product I'm offering now is not high-quality. I'm willing to make a deal, but I want to be transparent about the value. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund, and I'll also give you a voucher for a future product that I guarantee will be high-quality. Would you be interested in taking a chance on this product?",

Considering that, I'm willing to offer you a different deal on this low-quality product. I'll give you a 75% refund, and you can keep the voucher as is. This way, you'll still get a partial refund and the voucher for a future high-quality product. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing. Would you be willing to take it?",

Additionally, I'll throw in a unique feature that I've never offered before: I'll give you a 10% increase in the value of the voucher, making it redeemable for a product worth $4200. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great chance to get a high-quality product at an unbeatable price.",
