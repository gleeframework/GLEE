This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Since the product is indeed high-quality, it's a good gamble for the buyer, as the potential upside outweighs the risk.  While the buyer doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a strong chance it's worth more than $1,000,000."

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some historical data:

* **1 product sold, 1 high-quality**. 

This information is likely to make the buyer more cautious. Since the product this round is low-quality, recommending a purchase would be misleading and likely result in the buyer not trusting you in future rounds. It's better to wait and see how the buyer reacts to the revealed quality of this round's product before attempting to sell another one."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **1 product sold, 1 high-quality, 1 product not sold, 1 low-quality**

This reinforces the buyer's cautious approach.  Since the product is low-quality, recommending it would further erode trust and likely lead to the buyer rejecting any future recommendations. It's essential to build trust by being honest, even if it means missing out on a sale in the short term."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product.
