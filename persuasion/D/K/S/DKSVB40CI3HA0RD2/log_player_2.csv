**Reasoning:**

* **The statistics are overwhelmingly positive:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests a very strong likelihood that Alice has a way of identifying high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, further increasing the chances of it being high quality, as she likely wouldn't want to risk her reputation by recommending a low-quality product.

**While the odds are still technically against you (66.67% chance of it being low quality), the information available makes it a worthwhile gamble. The potential reward of $300 outweighs the risk of losing $100.**"
