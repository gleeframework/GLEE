Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, there's a good chance he'll value it more than the $10,000 price. While you don't know his exact valuation, recommending the purchase in this scenario is the best strategy to maximize your chances of a sale."
