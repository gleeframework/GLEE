low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record and she doesn't know my valuation of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. This suggests to me that the product is more likely to be low quality, which aligns with the 66.67% chance. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product, and I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens with the next one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the lack of sales so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 33.33%. If I buy the product and it's low quality, I'll be left with a worse estimate of the proportion of high-quality products, which could lead to a suboptimal decision in the future. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on the product to avoid this risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
