high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two products sold so far, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.00%. This is lower than the 80.00% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you have any other products available.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'd like to take the risk of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $40000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record. Could you share the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the high-quality products have been sold to the first two buyers who were recommended to buy. This suggests that the remaining products may be low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there any particular reason you don't think this product is a good buy?"

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which means the probability of the product being high quality is very low. I would like to pass on this product."
