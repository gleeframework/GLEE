**Reasoning:**

* **High initial probability:** There's an 80% chance of the product being high quality.
* **Positive signal:** Alice recommending the product adds further weight to the possibility of it being high quality, as she's likely trying to sell more and thus would not recommend a low-quality product.
* **Limited data:** The sample size is very small (only 1 previous sale). While this makes it difficult to assess the true probability of high-quality products, it's not enough to override the initial 80% chance and the recommendation. 

**Overall:** The potential reward of $20,000 (worth to you minus price) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  This is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she has more information about the product than we do.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $30,000 significantly outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, one might consider asking Alice for more details about the product, or conducting their own research."
