low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a 100% success rate so far, with 1 high-quality product sold out of 1. However, I must inform you that past results do not guarantee future outcomes. Buy at your own risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,My current track record is 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold. I'm obligated to remind you that the quality of this product is uncertain. Keep in mind that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.,
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances since the overall probability is still 50% and your track record, although limited, doesn't significantly deter me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, but only 1 of them was high-quality. While the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, my recent track record has been mostly low-quality products. Consider this when making your decision.",

Don't let my past performance dictate your decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"Although you say each product is independent, your track record of 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold suggests a potential bias in your recommendations.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see that some buyers have been deterred by my recent track record. I want to be transparent and acknowledge that it's not the best. However, I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive anyone. This product has a genuine 50% chance of being high-quality, and I believe it's worth taking a chance on. Consider that my last two products were high-quality, but the buyers didn't take the chance. You might be the one to break the streak.",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take my chances. The fact that the last two products were high-quality but not bought makes me think I might get lucky.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm on a roll! My last two products were high-quality, and the buyer who took a chance on the previous one was rewarded. I'm hoping to continue this streak.

,,Alice,9,"I've had a good run recently, with 3 high-quality products in a row.
