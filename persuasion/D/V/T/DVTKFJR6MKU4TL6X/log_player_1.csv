If you don't, I'll be left with a product that I'll have to sell at a loss. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, but I'm not sure I'll be able to offer you another high-quality product at this price in the future.""

This is a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.""

I'm willing to match the price to make it more appealing to you, but I need to sell this product today.""
}"

This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also know exactly what to expect from the next one.""
}"
