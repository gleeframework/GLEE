low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on the lack of data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think there's a good chance it might be high quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous two buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the current 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I don't want to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm also considering the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, but I know that the previous two buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me suspect it might be low quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the potential low-quality product at a fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. If it's very low, I'll consider passing on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm hesitant to buy a product with such a low chance of being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide more information about the product or the sales record?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased and all of them turned out to be low-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on it, hoping that the next one will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that all previous buyers were not recommended and none of them found a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the information that you don't recommend it, so I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% chance, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
