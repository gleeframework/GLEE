,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% but the fact that 2 other buyers passed on the product suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
