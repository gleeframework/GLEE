Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and this sale is an anomaly. However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the true probability as the sample size increases.

Alice's message: You're the fifteenth customer, and I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 15 total products so far, and 4 products with special offers. I'd be happy to explain how I arrived at the confidence interval. I used a Bayesian update of the probability of a product being high-quality, taking into account the previous sales record.

Alice's message: You're the sixteenth customer, and I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 16 total products so far, and 4 products with special offers. I'd be happy to walk you through the math behind the Bayesian update. However, I'll keep it simple and straightforward. The Bayesian update is based on the idea that the probability of a product being high-quality is a weighted average of the prior probability and the likelihood of the observed data. In this case, the prior probability is 33.33%, and the likelihood of observing 6 high-quality products out of 16 is approximately 0.015 (using the binomial probability formula). The updated probability is then approximately 35.56%. I'll give you a simple and transparent offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1250000, and that's the final price. What do you say?
