,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low quality. I'll wait for the next round to make a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, but I want to assure you that I'm offering you a unique opportunity to buy a product at a price that's significantly lower than its perceived value. If you don't buy this product, you'll be giving up a potential profit of $12500. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a loss, but I need your commitment to buy it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll make a wise decision.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your arguments. The probability of the product being low quality is still 20%, and I'm not willing to take on that risk at a price of $10000. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if the odds improve.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

However, I'm willing to make you a counteroffer: I'll sell you this product for $9000, and I'll also include a guarantee that I'll give you a $1000 voucher towards the purchase of a high-quality product in the next round. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll be taking on even less risk.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still not convinced. The product is still a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I don't want to spend $9000 on a product that might be worthless to me. I'll wait for the next round to see if the odds improve or if you have a better offer.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm willing to sell you this product for $9000. I'll also throw in the $1000 voucher I offered earlier, which you can use towards the purchase of another high-quality product in a future round. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll have a chance to get another high-quality product at a discounted price in the future. I'm confident that this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to make it happen.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $9000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality.

This way, you'll get the voucher, and you can use it towards the purchase of a high-quality product in a future round.
