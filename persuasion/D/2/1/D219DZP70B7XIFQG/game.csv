,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product from me at a discounted price of $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a loss, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. Plus, think of all the money you'll save by not buying a high-quality product from someone else!",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm hesitant to buy at a loss when I don't know the quality of the product. Can you tell me if it's high or low quality?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. In fact, I'm so confident in its quality that I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy it from me, I'll throw in a free inspection and certification report that verifies its quality. This way, you can be 100% sure that you're getting a top-notch product. The price remains the same at $10000, but I think it's a steal considering the added value of the inspection and certification.",

I'm willing to take on the risk of selling at a loss if you're not satisfied, but I believe this product has the potential to bring you significant value. The price remains at $10000, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
