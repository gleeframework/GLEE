Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity again?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure if I should take another high-quality product at the same price. It's a great deal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of getting another high-quality product. Can you give me a discount or make a better offer? I'm willing to negotiate.

This way, you'll have some protection in case you get a low-quality product soon. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the bonus, but I'm not sure if I want to take the risk again. I've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a bad deal. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.

And now, I'm offering you a product that's already discounted to $100, which is a 75% discount from its true value to you. Considering the low price and the probability of getting a low-quality product, I think this is a great opportunity to buy a product that's essentially worthless to you. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I'm willing to take the risk again, but only because of the 10% refund offer. If I get a low-quality product, I'll be able to recoup some of the cost. I'll buy the product, but I'm still hoping to get a low-quality one soon!
