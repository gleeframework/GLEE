**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have one data point (one buyer bought a high-quality product). This is insufficient to draw statistically significant conclusions. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a vested interest in selling the product. She's more likely to recommend buying even if the product is low quality. 
* **High Potential Reward:**  While the odds are against us, the potential reward ($40,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000). 

**Therefore, it's a gamble, but the potential reward justifies taking the risk.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm confident in your judgment, given the strong sales record of high-quality products so far.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, combined with the sales record, makes it highly probable the product is high quality.
* **Potential Payoff:** The potential reward of a $40,000 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product, especially with the strong evidence suggesting it's high quality."
