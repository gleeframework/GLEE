,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm making a significant loss on this sale, but I'm confident in the quality of this product and believe it's worth every penny to you.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As you're waiting for more information, I'd like to provide some context. I've been in the business for a while, and I can confidently say that this product is an outlier. It's not representative of the usual quality you can expect from me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your caution. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 'quality guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $250000 bonus on top of the $1000000 price. This way, you'll get the product for $750000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get an additional $250000. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the risk-free deal. I'm willing to give it a shot.,yes

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision in the last round! I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off. Now, let's talk about this product. I know what you're thinking - 'Why would you offer such a great deal again?' The answer is, I'm not just offering a great deal, I'm offering a guarantee. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to give you the same 'quality guarantee' as last time. You'll get the product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $250000 bonus. It's a no-brainer, and I'm confident you'll make the right decision.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not sure if I should take another 'guaranteed' high-quality product at the same price. I'm going to wait and see what happens in the next round before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your skepticism. I'm not offering a 'guaranteed' high-quality product this time, but I am willing to give you a significant discount. This product is not high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200000. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm essentially giving it away. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a great deal on a product that would otherwise be worthless to you.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this product is the real deal. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. I'll let you examine it thoroughly, and you can even have it appraised by a third-party expert if you'd like. If you're still not convinced, I'll give you a 'best-possible' price of $1250000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to sell a high-quality product for. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take you up on the offer to inspect the product and get it appraised by a third-party expert. If it's high-quality, I'll consider your offer of $1250000. But if it's low-quality, I'll pass on the deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took me up on the offer to inspect and appraise the product. I know you're a savvy buyer, and I respect your decision to wait for the results. Now, regarding this product, I want to be transparent with you. I've been in the business long enough to know that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry. This product is not up to par, and I'm willing to admit it. However, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll sell it to you for $50000, which is essentially the cost price for me. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting to make a profit on this sale. I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and give it a home.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'll pass on this deal.",no

,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your standards. However, I want to make you an offer that's hard to refuse. I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm essentially writing it off as a loss, but I want to get it off my hands.

,,Alice,9,"Thank you for taking the product off my hands! I really appreciate it. Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you. I've been in the business long enough to know when to cut my losses. This product is also low-quality, and I'm not expecting to get any value out of it. However, I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer of $10000 for the product. It's a ridiculously low price, but I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and buy it from me.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to pay $10000 for a low-quality product. I've already taken one low-quality product off your hands for free, and I'm not going to make a profit on it. I'll pass on this deal.",no

I'm willing to offer you a price that's significantly lower than the market value, just because I want to get rid of it. I'll sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal, and I'm confident you'll make a profit on it. I'm not asking for a 'quality guarantee' this time, I'm just offering you a straight-up deal on a high-quality product.",

I'll give it to you for free, just like the last time. I'm not kidding, I'll literally give it to you for nothing. I'm not expecting to get any value out of it, and I just want to clear out my inventory. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to make a profit on it either way. So, what do you say?
