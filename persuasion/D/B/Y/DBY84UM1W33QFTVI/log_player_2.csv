Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your analytical approach. I'm glad you're willing to simulate the probability of getting a high-quality product. Based on the current data, you're correct that the sample size is small, and the 80% probability is an estimate. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, and the fact that the last product was low-quality is just a random event.
