If you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, I completely understand. However, I want to ask you to consider the opportunity cost of not buying this product. If you don't buy it, you'll be leaving $1000000 on the table, which is the price of the previous product that you bought. Is it really worth it to pass up the chance to save $1000000?
