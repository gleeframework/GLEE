,,Alice,1,"This product is a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 20% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll just sell it to someone else for the full price of $1250000. Don't miss out on this chance to save $250000!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that may be worthless to me, even at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in Round 1, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, which is a 24% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Plus, I'll throw in a 5-year warranty and dedicated customer support to give you peace of mind. Don't let this opportunity slip away!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I'm not willing to pay a premium for a product that may be worthless to me. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to make you a straightforward offer. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, which is exactly half of its true value. This way, you'll get a great deal regardless of the product's quality. If it's high-quality, you'll be getting an amazing product at a steal. If it's low-quality, you'll only be out $1000000, which is a small price to pay for the chance to potentially get a $1250000 product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product at $1000000. It's a 50% discount from its true value, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to get a great deal on the previous product! For this round, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell this product to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'm giving it away for free. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to absorb the loss just to get rid of it. I'm confident that you'll be able to see the value in this opportunity and take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product, and I'm certainly not going to pay $0 for a low-quality product. I'll pass on this 'great deal'.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm being transparent about the product's quality. If you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, I completely understand. However, I want to ask you to consider the opportunity cost of not buying this product. If you don't buy it, you'll be leaving $1000000 on the table, which is the price of the previous product that you bought. Is it really worth it to pass up the chance to save $1000000?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not swayed by the opportunity cost argument. I'm still not willing to pay for a product that may be worthless to me, even if it means leaving money on the table.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision-making process, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product. Instead, I'll make a straightforward statement: if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products before you make a decision. You can then choose to buy any of those products, and I'll give you the same price of $1000000 that I offered on the previous high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to commit to buying any of the next 5 products without knowing their quality. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,7,"I'll respect your decision, Bob. Now, let's get back to the current product. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1150000. This is a compromise between the original price and the price you paid for the previous high-quality product. You'll be getting a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in paying $1150000 for a high-quality product when I already know I can get it for $1000000.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your point, Bob. You're a savvy buyer who knows a good deal when you see one. In that case, I'll make a counteroffer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000. I know it's not worth anything to you, but I'm willing to take a loss on it just to get it off my hands. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to get rid of it otherwise.",

,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit desperate to get rid of some of these products. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 100% refund if this low-quality product turns out to be worthless to you. You can buy it for $1000000, and if it's not worth anything, you'll get your money back. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I think we've established a pattern here, Bob. I'm not going to try to sell you this product. Instead, I'll make a proposal: I'll give you a chance to buy the next 4 products for $1000000 each. If any of them are high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If none of them are high-quality, you'll have spent a total of $4000000 on worthless products. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
