I'll sell it to you for $850000, and I'll not only provide the free inspection report, but I'll also give you a 100% money-back guarantee. If the product is indeed low-quality, you'll get your $850000 back in full. What do you say?

If you buy it, you'll be taking on a significant amount of risk. However, if you're feeling lucky, it could be a great opportunity. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in paying $900,000 for one high-quality product, let alone two. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a lower price.""
