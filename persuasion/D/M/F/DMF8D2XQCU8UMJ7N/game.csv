high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on the current product and see the statistics after the first product is revealed. I want to observe the quality of the first product before making a decision on the second one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll find out its quality regardless of your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the lack of sales of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the price of $10000, which is lower than its true value to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to me as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you share the probability of a product being high-quality given that you recommended not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product based on the statistics. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data and your recommendation. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or data that led you to advise against purchasing this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying, given the recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the previous products were all low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually higher than the prior 33.33% because the previous products were likely low-quality. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'll take the product and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low-quality or because you think it's high-quality but not worth the price?"
