,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know it's a 66.67% chance of being low quality, but I also know that if it's high quality, I'll get a great deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the odds and not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as it seems unusual given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality based on the previous sales record, but I'm skeptical about buying it given Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know why she's not recommending it, but I'm not confident enough to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is representative of the overall quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation? Is it based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of the product being high quality, not based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the low probability of that happening might actually be in my favor in this case."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you didn't recommend it, not because I trust the product's quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy it and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, considering the previous sales record shows only 1 high-quality product out of 10 sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on your previous sales record. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will take the product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is low, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she has an incentive to recommend low-quality products to other buyers, but not to me."
