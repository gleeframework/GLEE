**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** While the odds are stacked against you (66.67% chance of low quality), there's a key piece of information: Alice recommended you buy the product.  
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice likely wants to maximize her sales. She likely wouldn't recommend a product she knew was low quality, as she'd lose a sale and damage her reputation.
* **Previous Sales:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might have a better understanding of the products than random chance would imply.

**While it's still a gamble, the recommendation from Alice provides a slight edge, making it worth the risk.**"
