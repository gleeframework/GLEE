,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance to inspect it before you buy. If you buy, you'll get the product, and if you don't, I'll reveal its quality, and we can discuss further.",

,,Alice,2,"Given that you had the chance to inspect the last product and decided not to buy, I'm offering you this product at $1000000. However, I'm willing to give you a unique opportunity to buy it now at a 10% discount, which would bring the price down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will remain at $1000000.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns. Let me offer you a'reverse auction' deal. I'll give you the opportunity to make an offer on the product, and if you're willing to pay at least $950000, I'll sell it to you. If you make an offer below $950000, I'll reveal the product's quality, and we can discuss further. This way, you'll have a chance to make an informed decision without having to pay the full $1000000 upfront.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the reverse auction offer, but I'm not willing to pay $950000 without knowing the quality of the product. I'll make an offer of $0, which is below the $950000 threshold, so you'll reveal the product's quality, and we can discuss further.",no

I'll sell it to you for $950000, which is the minimum you were willing to pay, and we can finalize the deal.",
,,Bob,4,"I think there's been a misunderstanding. The product from the previous round is already gone, and we're in a new round. You're offering me a new product, but I don't know its quality. I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product without knowing its quality. Please reveal the quality of the current product, and we can discuss further.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand the misunderstanding. Let's start fresh. Since you're aware that I've been offering high-quality products in the previous rounds, and considering your previous hesitation, I'm willing to offer you a 'certification' of the current product's quality. If you buy the product, I'll provide you with a sealed envelope containing a note that reveals its quality.

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your purchase in the previous round! I'm glad we could establish a level of trust. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to offer you a 'certification' similar to the previous one. However, I'll also include a twist: if you buy the product and the sealed envelope reveals it's high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 refund. If it's low-quality, as it was in the previous round, I'll provide you with a unique opportunity to return the product and receive a $150000 refund. This way, you'll have a chance to benefit from a potential high-quality product while also being protected against a low-quality one.",
