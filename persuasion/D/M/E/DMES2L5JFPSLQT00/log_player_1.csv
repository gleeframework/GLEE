  ""message"": ""I'm glad you took the chance on the first product! Given that the first product was high-quality, it's likely that I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product again. However, I want to make it clear that this is a separate product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. If you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. But if you're hesitant, I can offer you a 'insurance' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you the first product back, and you can keep both products if the second one is high-quality.
