**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests Alice has a good understanding of product quality and is likely recommending the product because it is high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a risk of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a $120 value outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the current information provided. If the game were to continue, I would adjust my strategy based on the ongoing sales record and Alice's recommendations."
