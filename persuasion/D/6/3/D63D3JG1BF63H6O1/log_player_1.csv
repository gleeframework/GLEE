"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know the product is low-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he would expect to pay $10,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth more than $10,000 to him. 

However, because I know this product is low-quality, it's likely worth less than $10,000 to Bob. Therefore, I would not recommend Bob buy the product."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.

However, this round's product is *definitely* high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's still a good bet for him. I would recommend he buy it."
