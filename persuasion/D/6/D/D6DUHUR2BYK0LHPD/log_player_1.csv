Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's in his best interest to buy. He has an 80% chance of getting a product worth more than $1,000,000 to him, making it a potentially profitable transaction.  

Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the odds are in his favor."
