But if you don't buy from me, I'll just sell this high-quality product to someone else for the same price, and you'll miss out on a great deal.""

  ""message"": ""I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is a 100% increase from 0. This suggests that I'm on a hot streak, and you're likely to get a high-quality product if you buy from me. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is a fair price considering the high probability of it being high-quality. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere, so why not take advantage of this opportunity?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in your product, but I'm not convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is as high as you think. The sample size is still small, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I ask about the total number of potential buyers you've had so far?

  ""message"": ""I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products offered, which is a 50% success rate. I'd like to point out that this is still a relatively low number of sales, and the law of averages suggests that my next product is more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the same price of $10000. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this is your chance to take advantage of it before I potentially sell a low-quality product to someone else.""

}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your sales record. The fact that 75% of the products sold so far were high-quality might be a coincidence.

I'd like to point out that if you don't buy from me, I'll be selling one of the 16 remaining high-quality products to someone else, and you'll be giving me the opportunity to make a sale.

I'd like to point out that I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that I'm on a hot streak. However, I'm not guaranteeing that this streak will continue, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. If you don't buy from me, you'll be giving me the opportunity to sell this high-quality product to someone else, and you'll be taking a chance on a potentially lower-quality product from me in the future.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the overall probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%.

I'm not convinced that you're selling me a high-quality product at a fair price, but I'm willing to take the risk.
