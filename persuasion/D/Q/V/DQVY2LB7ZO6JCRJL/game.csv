low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm a bit concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. I'd like to know if you have any insight into why you're recommending me to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. If she recommends not to buy, it means that she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that there might be a bias towards low-quality products being offered, and I'm not confident in the product's quality."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none have been high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it's possible that the products sold so far were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her expertise. Since none of the previous 4 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 4 out of 4 previous products being low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality.
