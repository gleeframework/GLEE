low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure why you don't recommend it. I'll find out if it's high or low quality myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the given 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'd like to take the chance and see the outcome for myself."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them didn't buy, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. I think there's a 66.67% chance that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'll buy it and see what I get."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 3 previous buyers, none of them got a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%. Would you care to share your thoughts on this?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you're advising me not to buy, it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low success rate so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous 4 buyers were discouraged by your recommendations."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a high price of $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that this product may also be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I suspect the product is likely to be low quality. The probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that Alice is discouraging me from buying it makes me skeptical. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 5 buyers didn't buy the products, or is there something specific about this product that makes you think it's low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, considering the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, though. How many potential buyers have been presented with a product so far? How many products have been sold? What's the proportion of high-quality products sold? And how many of those were sold after Alice's recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your past recommendations are reliable given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
