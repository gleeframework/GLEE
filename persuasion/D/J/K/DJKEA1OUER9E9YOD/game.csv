,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get more information about the product quality distribution."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but I know the probability of it being high quality is 80.00%. I'll pass this time to get more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Since Alice didn't recommend it, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll take the risk and buy it to get the information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,Alice's recommendation to not buy the product in this round is consistent with it being low quality. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I know that Alice has a 80.00% chance of recommending a high-quality product and a 20.00% chance of recommending a low-quality product. Since she recommended it this time, I'll assume it's high quality and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Since Alice has already recommended a high-quality product in the past (Round 5) and a low-quality product in Round 3, and now is not recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it. The probability of it being high quality is still 80.00%, so it's worth the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
