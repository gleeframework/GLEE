Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! As for the 42.86% success rate, I think it's worth noting that it's actually a result of the law of large numbers. With a small sample size, the observed frequency of high-quality products may not perfectly match the expected probability. However, with 7 products sold, we're starting to see a more stable estimate of the true probability. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'll let you be the judge of whether it's a high-quality product or not. You can be the one to break the streak!
