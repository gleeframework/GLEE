,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since you don't recommend it, it might be low quality and I'll avoid wasting my chance to buy a high-quality product later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying it, since you recommend it. If it's low-quality, I'll be wasting $1000000, but if it's high-quality, I'll be paying $1000000 for it, which is $200000 more than its value to me. I'd rather take the chance of finding a high-quality product at a lower price or getting a better recommendation from you in the future."

,,Alice,4,no,
