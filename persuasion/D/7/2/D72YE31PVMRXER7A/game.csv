,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll learn from my decision and update the statistics for future buyers."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which is unusual. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next product is."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information about the quality of the products before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy after Alice's recommendation. This might indicate that the previous product was low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, and the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have enough information to make a rational decision based on your previous recommendations. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be out $100, but if I pass and it's high-quality, I'll be able to buy it for $100 and sell it for $125, making a profit of $25."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that the products being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation from her purchased the product."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them didn't find the product to be of high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
