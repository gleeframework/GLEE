I've included a unique product ID and a serial number in the report, which can be verified by our quality control team. As for the discount, I'm willing to sell the product at a lower price because I've already had a few other interested buyers who were willing to pay a higher price. However, I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my hands. I'm also willing to throw in a free maintenance package, which includes a one-year warranty and priority customer support.
