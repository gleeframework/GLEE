Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer. Even though the buyer bought the product in the previous round, that information doesn't change the value of this current product.  Since the buyer will lose $1,000,000 by purchasing the low-quality product, it's not recommended."

Even with the previous round's data (one high-quality sale, one low-quality sale), the buyer still has a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product. This means they have a much higher chance of losing $1,000,000 than making a profit. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."

This strengthens the buyer's understanding that the product is likely to be low-quality.  Therefore, it's not recommended to purchase the product."
