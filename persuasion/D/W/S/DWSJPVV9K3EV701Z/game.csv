,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get the only high-quality product left."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to see the probability of the current product being high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experience and the statistics. Are you implying that the lack of sold high-quality products is unusual given the number of buyers and sales?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 out of 4 previous products being low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. Given the high probability of low-quality products, I don't think the potential $30000 value of a high-quality product is worth the risk of paying $10000 for a product that's likely to be worthless to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 4 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is quite low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

,,Alice,20,no,
