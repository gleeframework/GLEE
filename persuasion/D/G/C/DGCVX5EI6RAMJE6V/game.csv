low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since there's no prior data to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind the recommendation. Was it because of the lack of sales so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to test Alice's recommendation system. I'm not convinced by her previous recommendations, and I'd like to see if she's right or wrong."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to pass and none of them bought. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, which in turn suggests that this product might be high-quality. I'm taking a calculated risk here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm doing this because I'm aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products remaining in the pool."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. If she had recommended it, I would have passed on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 7 buyers having passed on the products and no high-quality products sold yet, I suspect the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 8 buyers didn't find it valuable enough to buy, and I don't have any information that would make me think this one is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might be a sign that all the high-quality products have already been sold, making it more likely that this product is low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given your recommendation and the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to buy it, I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, because the sample size is still relatively small and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. The fact that 9 out of 9 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low, but I still think the potential reward is worth the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 10, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality."
