,,Alice,3,yes,

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you have any more information to share about its quality before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the statistics. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and what made you decide not to recommend this product to me?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'm not confident in buying a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality, especially with no previous sales of high-quality products."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
