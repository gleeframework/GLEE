,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, and you recommended I buy. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since I've seen that none have been sold so far."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is very low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%.
