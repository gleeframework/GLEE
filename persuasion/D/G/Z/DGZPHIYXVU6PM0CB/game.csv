low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first mover, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which might indicate that the products she's been offering are mostly low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm only doing so because I think it's a high-probability low-quality product, and I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, and I don't want it to be discarded. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous buyers who purchased the products, such as their decision-making process and any other relevant details."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of sales and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and is only basing her recommendation on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold, I'm guessing that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the fact that you don't recommend it might be a good sign that it's low quality. If it's high quality, I'm making a mistake, but if it's low quality, I'm making a good decision. I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what your criteria are for recommending or not recommending, but I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have been incorrect in the past."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low quality, which would be a good opportunity for me to buy it at a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I'd like. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide more information or offer a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
