"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which might indicate that the products she's been offering are mostly low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm only doing so because I think it's a high-probability low-quality product, and I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product.
