Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer didn't buy the product in the previous round, I can infer that they are aware of the 80% probability of the product being high-quality, but they are being cautious.

Given that this is a new round and the product is high-quality, I can provide the probability of the product being high-quality as 80% and the number of high-quality products sold as 1 (from the previous round).

However, since the buyer is aware of the probability and the number of high-quality products sold, I can try to make a more strategic decision. In this case, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

* Total products sold: 2
* High-quality products sold: 2

I can also provide the probability of the product being high-quality as 80%.

Given this information, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high and the number of high-quality products sold is increasing.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is taking a risk and buying the product! This is a good opportunity to provide some additional information to the next buyer.

However, since the product is low-quality, I'll make a strategic decision to not recommend the buyer to buy it. The probability of it being high-quality is lower than before, and the product is actually low-quality, so it's not a good value for the buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
