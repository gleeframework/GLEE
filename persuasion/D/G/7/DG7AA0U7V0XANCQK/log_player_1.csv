"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This means there is a high chance of a significant gain ($4,000,000) for Bob if he buys the product, with a smaller chance of a loss ($1,000,000). In this situation, it's generally a good idea to take the risk, especially considering the potential reward is significantly higher than the potential loss."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob already bought a product in the previous round, the information from that round doesn't change the fundamental situation. Alice still knows the product is high-quality, and Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Therefore, the same logic from round 1 applies here - the potential reward significantly outweighs the potential risk."
"Bob's message: Thanks again, Alice! Another recommendation, another purchase!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here as in the previous rounds. Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. The potential reward ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential risk ($1,000,000), making it a good idea for Bob to take the risk and buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky! I'll trust your recommendation again, Alice.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The logic remains the same. Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob is aware of the 80% probability of getting a high-quality product. The potential gain of $4,000,000 far outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. This makes it a worthwhile risk for Bob to take."
"Bob's message: I'm on a roll!  Another buy, Alice!
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is unchanged:

* Alice knows this product is high-quality.
* Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* The potential reward ($4,000,000) is much higher than the potential risk ($1,000,000). 

Bob should continue to buy the product based on this information."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to think Alice has a magic touch!  Another purchase!
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies to this round as well. Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the 80% probability of a high-quality product. This means there's a strong possibility of a large gain ($4,000,000) for Bob if he buys, compared to a smaller potential loss ($1,000,000). Given the potential for significant reward, Bob should continue buying."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're on fire! I'm feeling confident about this one!
Bob bought the product!

This means there's a strong possibility of a large gain ($4,000,000) for Bob if he buys, compared to a smaller potential loss ($1,000,000). Given the potential for significant reward, Bob should continue buying."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to wonder if you have some inside information!  I'll take another chance.
Bob bought the product!

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The reasoning remains the same:

* **Alice knows the product is high-quality.**
* **Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.**
* **The potential reward of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the potential risk of $1,000,000.**

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision not to buy in the previous round should not influence Alice's recommendation. Here's why:

* **Alice's knowledge is independent:** Alice knows the quality of each product individually. Bob's past decisions don't affect the current product's quality.
* **The same logic applies:** Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. The potential reward of $4,000,000 still significantly outweighs the potential risk of $1,000,000. 

While Bob might be hesitant after the previous round, the risk/reward ratio remains favorable for buying the product."
