,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'm not willing to take a chance on a potentially low-quality product, even at a discounted price with bonuses. I'd rather wait for a product that I know is high-quality.",no

Would that change your mind? I can provide you with the report and the contact information of the organization that conducted the testing. Would you like to see the evidence for yourself?",
