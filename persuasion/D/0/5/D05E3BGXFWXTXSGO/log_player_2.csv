Alice's message: We've had an interesting conversation with our previous buyer, and we're happy to share more information with you. The first product we sold was a low-quality one, and the second product was high-quality. So, we've sold 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality product so far. Given this information, the probability of a high-quality product is now 50%. However, I'd like to highlight that this high-quality product we have now is a rare opportunity, and we're willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a unique chance to get a high-quality product, and we're confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

Alice's message: We appreciate your curiosity about our previous buyers' decision-making process. To be honest, our previous buyers were motivated by the probability of getting a high-quality product, which they estimated to be 33.33% initially. However, after our sales record was updated, they made their decisions based on the updated probability of 50%. Now, with 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of a high-quality product is 66.67%. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $10000. Given the updated probability, we believe this is a strong opportunity for you to get a high-quality product, and we're confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

Alice's message: We understand your concerns, and we respect your decision-making process. However, we'd like to clarify that the probability of a low-quality product is actually 33.33% (1 out of 3 products sold so far were low-quality). But, as you've seen, we've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that we might have a higher proportion of high-quality products left in stock. We're offering you this high-quality product for $10000. We believe it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product, and we're confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

Alice's message: You're absolutely right about the probability of a high-quality product being sold in a row. We appreciate your mathematical rigor. To answer your question, we've sold 3 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. We have 17 products left in stock.

Alice's message: We understand your concerns, and we respect your decision-making process. However, we'd like to highlight that the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than the probability of a high-quality product at this point.
