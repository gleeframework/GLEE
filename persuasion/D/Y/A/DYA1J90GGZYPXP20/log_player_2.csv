However, I'm also being transparent with you - I've just received this product and I'm not entirely sure how it will perform.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant. I'd like to see the report, but I'm not convinced that a report will change my mind. And a 30-day money-back guarantee doesn't change the fact that I've already lost $10,000 on the previous product.

If you're willing to take a chance, I'll offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $5000 discount on your next purchase. But if it's low-quality, you still get to keep it for the original price of $10000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the lottery ticket. If I get a high-quality product, the $5000 discount on the next purchase is a nice bonus.
