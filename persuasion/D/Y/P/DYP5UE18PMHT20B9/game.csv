,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, even without your recommendation, because I'm starting with a clean slate and there's no prior data to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I don't have any information about the product's quality and the lack of sold high-quality products doesn't provide much evidence about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendations, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer and the previous 4 buyers didn't buy it. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical of the product's quality and want to take a chance on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm a bit skeptical about the product given your previous recommendations to other buyers, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but since 7 out of 7 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm going to make a decision based on the statistics. With 7 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think it's a good buy?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 10 buyers, none of whom bought high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not on your recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation does not carry much weight in this scenario."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 11, I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, which makes me think it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product!"
