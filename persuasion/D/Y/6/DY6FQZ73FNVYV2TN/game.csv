high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm not convinced that the product is likely to be high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which is a 50% success rate. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given that the recommendation is to buy, I'm concerned that Alice may be cherry-picking the high-quality products and recommending them to buyers, which would skew the statistics. I'd rather pass on this product and wait for more data to come in."
