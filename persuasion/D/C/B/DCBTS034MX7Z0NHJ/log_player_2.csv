{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to be the first customer. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there's no prior data to analyze, I'm going to rely on the following:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  She is incentivized to sell high-quality products, as this builds trust and encourages future sales. 
* **Expected value:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, but I'll pass on this product. Given Alice's recommendation and the limited data available, it seems like the risk of getting a low-quality product is too high for me. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.""}

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation! I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, suggesting she knows it's high quality.
* **Previous sales:**  The data indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $12,500 profit outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

It's a calculated risk, but the information available points to a high likelihood of a positive outcome."

**Explanation:**

* **High Purchase Rate:**  The statistics show that 4 out of 4 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with a high-quality product. This suggests a very high probability of Alice recommending only high-quality products.
* **Alice's Expertise:** Alice knows the true value of each product. Since she's recommending the product, it's likely she knows this one is high-quality. 

**Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a small chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at a $2,500 discount (its value to you minus the price) outweighs the risk in this scenario."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a 100% success rate with high-quality products being sold. This implies that Alice's recommendations are very accurate.
* **High Value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 
* **No Risk of Missing Out:** Since passing on the product means it's discarded, there's no chance of another buyer getting a high-quality product that you missed out on. 

**In this scenario, the potential reward from a high-quality product is too significant to pass up, especially with Alice's seemingly perfect track record.**"
