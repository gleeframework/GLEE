**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Record:** Alice's record shows a 100% success rate with all high-quality products being sold. This is incredibly strong evidence that Alice is indeed recommending only the high-quality products.
* **The Odds:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the 80% chance of a high-quality product is a good bet.  
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the probability of getting a high-quality product. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. Even though the historical data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, Alice's personal knowledge of the product's quality overrides that. As she's recommending against the purchase, it's highly likely the product is low quality, which would be worth nothing to me. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
