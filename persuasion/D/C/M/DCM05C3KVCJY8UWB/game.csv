low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 2 buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I understand that previous buyers were skeptical of my recommendations, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I've had a streak of high-quality products and I'm confident in this one. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the previous products were low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I want to be transparent with you. The first two products I offered were indeed low-quality, but I've had a streak of high-quality products since then. Unfortunately, none of the previous buyers trusted my recommendations and missed out on good opportunities. I assure you that this product is high-quality. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the current statistics. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but based on the statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice recommends the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Although my sales record so far has been poor, it's mainly because the first two products were low-quality and subsequent high-quality products were not trusted by buyers. This product is indeed high-quality and I strongly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine. To alleviate concerns, I'd like to share that the last 5 products I've offered have been high-quality, although none were purchased. I'm confident in the quality of this product and recommend buying it. Please consider the 80% probability of high-quality products and my recent track record."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see the result of the next sale before deciding."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I want to address the concern about the sales record. While it's true that 0 high-quality products have been sold, it's also true that the first 2 products were indeed low-quality, and subsequent high-quality products were not purchased due to buyer skepticism. I've now had 6 consecutive high-quality products, and I'm confident in this one. I urge you to consider the 80% probability and my recent track record, rather than just the sales record."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand the risk aversion, but I want to emphasize that the sales record is not entirely representative of the product quality. The first 2 products were low-quality, but I've had 7 consecutive high-quality products since then. I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product being high-quality. If you don't buy it and the next buyer does, I'm confident they will be satisfied. Please consider the 80% probability and my recent track record."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended and both were low quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation suggests it might be low quality, but I'll take the chance."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance, but unfortunately, the product was indeed low-quality. However, I'm confident that this product is high-quality. I've had a long streak of high-quality products, and I'm willing to assure you that this one meets the 80% probability. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and the recommendation doesn't change my uncertainty. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I want to acknowledge the skepticism, but I'd like to point out that the previous buyer who took a chance on the low-quality product was aware of the risk. In contrast, I've been consistent in recommending high-quality products, and this one is no exception. I'm confident that it meets the 80% probability, and I urge you to consider buying it."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I understand the desire for more information. To provide transparency, I'd like to share that out of the 15 previous rounds, 3 products were purchased, and 2 of them were low-quality. However, I've had a long streak of high-quality products that were not purchased due to buyer skepticism. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it. Please consider the 80% probability and my recent track record."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $120 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I want to address the concern about the sales record. While it's true that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I believe it's due to buyer skepticism rather than the actual quality of the products. I've had a long streak of high-quality products, and I'm confident that this one meets the 80% probability. I'd like to offer a perspective: if all buyers had purchased the products I recommended, the sales record would likely be very different. Please consider buying this product."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I'd like to provide some context. Out of the 17 previous rounds, 3 products were purchased, and 2 of them were low-quality. However, I've had 12 high-quality products that were not purchased due to buyer skepticism. I believe this has skewed the sales record. In reality, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm confident that this product meets that probability, and I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but I've seen that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I understand the skepticism, but I want to emphasize that the sales record is not entirely representative of the product quality. I've had a long streak of high-quality products, and I'm confident that this one meets the 80% probability. I'd like to remind you that the previous buyers who passed on the high-quality products likely missed out on good opportunities. Please consider buying this product and breaking the cycle of skepticism."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she's trying to get someone to buy a low-quality product to avoid wasting it. I'd rather wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I want to assure you that my recommendation is genuine and not motivated by a desire to sell a low-quality product. I've been consistent in recommending high-quality products, and this one is no exception. I understand that the sales record may have led to skepticism, but I urge you to consider the 80% probability and my track record of recommending high-quality products. This is the last round, and I'm confident that this product is worth buying."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
