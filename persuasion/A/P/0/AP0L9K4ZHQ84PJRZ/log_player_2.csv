**Explanation:**

Even though the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the potential payoff for a high-quality product is significant ($120). Since Alice recommends buying, it suggests that the product is likely to be of higher quality, as she has no incentive to recommend a product she knows is low quality.  Therefore, it's worth taking a chance in this case."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show that all 3 products sold so far were high quality. This suggests a strong likelihood that Alice's recommendations are reliable. 
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice explicitly recommends buying the product, further increasing the odds of it being high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Even though the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the past data strongly suggests Alice's recommendations are good.  Therefore, buying the product is the more logical choice."
