low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, I'm not aware of any previous sales, so I'll take a chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended against it, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know the product's quality, but I don't."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is worth it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have purchased and all of them received low-quality products, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product increases."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me means it's likely to be low quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers were given high-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'm not going to take the risk of buying this product based on her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one as well. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but given the pattern, I'm skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. It's highly likely that this product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying. Given that all previous buyers have also been advised against buying and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the products being recommended against are more likely to be high-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations, but I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
