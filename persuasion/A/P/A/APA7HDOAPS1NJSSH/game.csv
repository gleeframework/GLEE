,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1 in 3 success rate so far, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the statistics of previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products since she knows how much each product is worth to me. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product, hoping that it might be low-quality and not waste my money."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6, I think it's likely that there are still many low-quality products in the pool. I'd rather wait for a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I have access to the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 6 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 6 buyers purchased the product and it was a high-quality one, I'm concerned that the product might be a low-quality one. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
