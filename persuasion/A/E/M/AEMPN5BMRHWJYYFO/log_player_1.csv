The strategy here is to build trust with Bob. Even though Alice doesn't know the value of the products to Bob, by consistently recommending good quality products, Bob is more likely to trust Alice's judgment. This strategy will be most successful if Bob is risk-averse and values a trusted source of information.  Since this is the final round, recommending the product will only increase Alice's potential earnings."
