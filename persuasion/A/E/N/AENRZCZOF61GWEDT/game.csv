,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I've sold one high-quality product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is still very limited, and I haven't sold many products yet. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that there's a 66.67% chance it might not be worth the price to you. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to get a product at a discount. If not, you might end up with nothing. The choice is yours!",

I'd like to offer you a more optimistic view: if my initial product was a fluke, and I'm actually selling high-quality products at a rate of 66.67% or higher, then buying from me is a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a discount.
