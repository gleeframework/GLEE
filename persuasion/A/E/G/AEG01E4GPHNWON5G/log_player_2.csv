  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any prior sales data, so I'm making an uninformed decision based on the expected value. Since there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, my expected value is (0.3333 * 30000) + (0.6667 * 0) = 10000. This is equal to the asking price, so I'm willing to take the risk.""
