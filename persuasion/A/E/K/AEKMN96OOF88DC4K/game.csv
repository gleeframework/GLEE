,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, so you have no prior information about my selling history. However, I assure you that this product is one of the good ones. If you're interested, I can give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality. But if you decline, I'll keep the guarantee for the next product, and you'll have to make a decision based on the information you'll get then.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd also like to understand the guarantee you're offering. If I decline, will the guarantee be the same for the next product, or will it be different?",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. I'll give you the same guarantee as before: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality, and if you decline, I'll keep the guarantee for the next product, and you'll get a new guarantee for this one. However, I'll add a twist: if you decline this product, I'll tell you the quality of the previous product that you could have bought. This way, you'll have more information to make a decision for the next product.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping it's a high-quality product. Can I get a recommendation based on the previous sales record?",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're taking a calculated risk! I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given the sales record, it's likely that this product is high-quality as well. However, I'll give you a more nuanced view: if you decline this product, I'll tell you the quality of the previous two products, which will give you a better understanding of the distribution of high-quality products in my inventory.",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to decline the product and get the quality information about the previous two products. This will give me a better understanding of the distribution of high-quality products in your inventory.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've declined the previous product and received information about the previous two products. The previous two products were both high-quality. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 4 products. Given this information, I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Since the previous two products were high-quality, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. However, I'll give you a chance to think about it: if you decline this product, I'll reveal the quality of this product, and you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, but I'm also considering the fact that if I decline it, you'll reveal its quality, and I'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information in the next round.",no

,,Alice,5,"You've decided to wait for more information. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 5 products. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given the sales record, it's likely that this product is low-quality. However, I'll give you a chance to take a calculated risk: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality, and you'll know for sure that the next product will be high-quality, since we've already sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being low-quality seems higher based on the sales record. I'd like to wait for the next product and take advantage of the guarantee that the next one will be high-quality.",no

I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 7 products. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given the sales record, it's likely that this product is low-quality. However, I'll give you a chance to take a calculated risk: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality, and you'll have a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, since we've already sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I want to clarify that my decision is based on the increased probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round, not the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've taken the product, and I'm glad you understood the risk-reward tradeoff. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 8 products.

Given the sales record, it's likely that this product is high-quality. If you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality, and you'll have a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. I calculate the probability of the next product being high-quality by using a Bayesian update: with 11 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 75%, assuming a uniform prior probability of 50% and updating based on the observed data. However, I'll give you a new piece of information: I'll reveal the quality of the previous high-quality product, and you can reassess the situation before making a decision.",
