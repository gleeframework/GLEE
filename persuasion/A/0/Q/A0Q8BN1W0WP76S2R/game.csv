low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the lack of sales of high-quality products so far, and the fact that Alice's recommendation is not based on any knowledge of my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous two buyers didn't buy after your recommendations, which suggests that your recommendations might be based on the product's quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not very informative. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This means that Alice's recommendation is essentially random. I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase the likelihood that it's high quality, since you've seen 4 previous products and none of them were high quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high quality might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations haven't been very promising so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight with me. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm curious to see if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see its quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a particular reason behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll make a different decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially considering the low success rate of previous buyers."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that 8 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even if you don't recommend it. I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm not convinced that your recommendation is reliable given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 10 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product regardless of my decision."
