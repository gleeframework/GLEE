Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I appreciate your interest in learning more about the product. I'd be happy to provide you with some general information about the product's features. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not a good representation of what I typically offer. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. If you're still interested in waiting, I'll keep you updated on the next few rounds, but I want to reiterate that this product is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate the price. If you're willing to take a chance, I can offer you a 'preview' of the next product's quality before you make a decision. Would you like that?

I'll let you know if it's high-quality or low-quality, but you'll still need to decide whether to buy it based on that information. That being said, I'm excited to share with you that the next product is... high-quality! This is a top-of-the-line item that I'm confident you'll love. Would you like to purchase it for the full $10000?
