,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product worth potentially $3000000, but I need to inform you that this is the first round and I'm not sure if I can trust you yet. I'm willing to give you a chance to prove your worth. Please consider this a 'test' round. If you're interested, I'll let you have the product for $1000000, which is a 67% discount from its potential value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be so generous in the future.",

Now that we've established a level of trust, I'll offer you a product that I believe has a high potential value. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is worth $3000000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, just like the previous round. However, I'll give you a slight nudge: I'll throw in a guarantee that if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll offer you an exclusive deal on the next product, which could potentially save you a significant amount of money.
