low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on it for now."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommends it, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 3 buyers must have gotten low-quality products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
