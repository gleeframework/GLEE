high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice.
