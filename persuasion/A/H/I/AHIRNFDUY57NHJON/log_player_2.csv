I want to be upfront with you, but I also want to make it clear that this is not a reflection on the value of the previous products you've purchased. They were indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're happy with them. However, I'm offering you a chance to cut your losses on this one for $100, which is the price of the product. It's a sunk cost, but it might be worth it to you to get rid of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the honesty, Alice. I appreciate you giving me the chance to avoid a loss. I'll pass on this product, and I'll look forward to the next opportunity to make a smart purchase.""}"

I'm not going to sugarcoat it this time. If you buy it, you'll be wasting your money. But, I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 'free' product with this one, which means you can choose to buy this low-quality product and get another one of your choice (from a future round) for free. It's a chance to get another product at a later time, but you'll still be paying the full $100 for this one. What do you think?
