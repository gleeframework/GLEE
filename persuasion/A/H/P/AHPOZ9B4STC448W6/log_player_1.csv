Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:**  He knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product is (0.3333 * $1,200,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $400,000
* **Price vs. Value:**  The product costs $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than the expected value. 

Even though this round's product is high-quality, Bob has no way of knowing that.  He's making decisions based on the overall probability and the expected value, which doesn't justify the purchase."
