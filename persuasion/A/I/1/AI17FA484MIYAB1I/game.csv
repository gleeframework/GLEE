high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a product for sale. It's a great buy and one of my best offerings.,
,,Bob,1,"Since I don't know the true quality of the product and there is a 50% chance of it being low quality, I will not buy it this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a product for sale. It's an average product, and I think some people might find it useful.",
,,Bob,2,"Regardless of your description, the probability of the product being high or low quality remains 50%. I'll wait for more information or a change in your pricing strategy before making a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll be honest with you, my previous two products didn't sell. I'm starting to think I should offer some kind of assurance. However, my prices are fixed. If you buy 2 products from me and both are low-quality, I'll give you a free product on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,3,"Your assurance doesn't change the probability of the current product being high or low quality. It also requires me to buy two products before I can potentially get a free one, which still carries a significant risk. I'll need a more substantial incentive to make a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll try to offer more assurance without changing the price. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free product on your next purchase, no need to buy two. This way, you'll have a chance to try again with less risk.",
,,Bob,4,"With this new assurance, I'm willing to take the risk. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a free product on my next purchase, which reduces my potential losses. I'll buy this product and see how it turns out.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"As promised, since the previous product was low-quality, you are eligible for a free product on this round. However, I must inform you that this current product is also being sold at the regular price to new customers. You can choose to take this product for free or wait for the next round. If you wait, the free offer will be void, and you'll have to buy at the regular price.",
,,Bob,5,"Since I'm eligible for a free product and I don't have to pay anything, I'll take this opportunity. The potential value of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential value of a low-quality product ($0), and I'm not risking any money. I'll take the free product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took advantage of the free offer last round. However, this round is back to normal. I'll offer you another assurance: if you buy this product and the next one, and both are low-quality, I'll refund you the price of one product on your next purchase after that. Keep in mind that my prices are still fixed, but I'm trying to show you that I'm committed to providing value.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your efforts to provide assurance, but this offer is not enough to convince me to buy. The potential refund is still contingent on me buying two products and both being low-quality, which is a significant upfront risk. I'll wait for a more substantial or immediate incentive before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand that my previous offers weren't enough to convince you. This time, I'll try something different. I'll give you a 'quality guarantee' on this product. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll immediately refund you the full price on your next purchase. However, if it's high-quality, the guarantee will be void, and you'll have gotten a great product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take the risk to show you the value of my products.",
,,Bob,7,"This 'quality guarantee' is a more substantial and immediate incentive. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a full refund on my next purchase, which reduces my risk. If it's high-quality, I'll have gotten a great product worth $125. I'm willing to take the risk with this one-time offer and see how it turns out.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took advantage of the 'quality guarantee' last round, and I'm happy to say that it paid off for you. However, I must inform you that the guarantee was a one-time offer, and I won't be able to provide it again. This round, I'll offer you a different incentive: I'll reveal to you that the quality of this product is the same as the quality of the previous product you bought. Take that information into consideration when making your decision.",
,,Bob,8,"Since the quality of this product is the same as the quality of the previous product I bought, and the previous product was high-quality, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. With a potential value of $125, I'm willing to buy this product at the fixed price of $100.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've had a good streak with my products, and I'm glad to see that you're satisfied. I'll continue to be transparent with you: this product is also high-quality, just like the previous two. I know that I'm giving away valuable information, but I want to build trust with you and show you that I'm committed to providing excellent products. Take this information into consideration when making your decision.",
,,Bob,9,"With your assurance that this product is high-quality, just like the previous two, I'm confident in my decision to buy. The potential value of $125 is a clear advantage over the fixed price of $100. I appreciate your transparency and commitment to providing excellent products, and I'm willing to continue doing business with you.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad to see that our partnership is working out well. As a token of appreciation for your continued business, I'll be honest with you again: this product is also high-quality, just like the previous three. I'm willing to maintain this level of transparency with you, as I value our relationship and want to ensure that you're always satisfied with your purchases. You can buy with confidence, knowing that you're getting a great product.",
,,Bob,10,"With your continued assurance that this product is high-quality, I have no reason to doubt its value. I appreciate your transparency and commitment to our partnership, and I'm willing to continue buying from you as long as you maintain this level of quality and honesty. I'll buy this product with confidence, knowing that I'm getting a great deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I want to be upfront with you, as I have been in our previous dealings. Unfortunately, this product does not meet the same standards as the previous four. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is low-quality. I know this may be a disappointment, but I value our partnership and want to maintain transparency. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll sell it to you at the same price as before. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not recommending it, and I wouldn't want you to be surprised or disappointed if it doesn't meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty and transparency, and I respect your decision to be upfront about the product's quality. Given that the product is low-quality and not recommended, I don't see any reason to buy it, especially at the same price as the high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
