high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that I sold a high-quality product in the previous round, which is a great indicator of my overall quality. However, keep in mind that there's still a 20% chance that this product might be low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteed to sell high-quality products, and you're taking a risk by buying from me. The price is non-negotiable.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and your past performance, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two high-quality products in a row, which might make you think I'm on a hot streak. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've sold two high-quality products out of three total products, which means there's still a significant chance that this product could be low-quality. In fact, the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are not in your favor.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product, which means I've sold 2/3 high-quality products so far. This is actually better than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, which suggests that I might be selling more high-quality products than expected. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I think the statistics are in my favor this time.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer and the insights. Given the statistics and your track record, I believe the chances are in favor of this product being high-quality. I'll take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold three high-quality products out of four total products, which means I've exceeded the expected probability of 80%. This suggests that I might be selling more high-quality products than I should be, which could indicate that the remaining products are even more likely to be high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are strongly in your favor this time.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and your explanation, I believe the odds are indeed in my favor. I am willing to purchase the product for $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've now sold four high-quality products out of five total products, which means I've sold 80% high-quality products, exactly matching the expected probability. This suggests that my previous streak was just a coincidence, and I'm back to the expected average. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are now neutral, and you should make your decision based on your own risk tolerance.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the clarification, Alice.
