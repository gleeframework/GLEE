low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're not convinced, but I'm willing to make a transparent offer. I'll tell you that this product is one of the 50% that I'm not confident in. I'm willing to let it go for $8000, but I'm also willing to throw in a free accessory that's worth $1000 if you buy it. It's a risk-free way to get a good deal on a product that might not be the best, but still has some value.",

I'm confident you'll love this product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of a potential return.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on getting a great deal on the previous product! I'm glad you took the chance. Now, for this new product, I want to be upfront with you. I've already told you that 50% of the products are low-quality, and I'm not confident in this one. I'll let it go for $4000, which is a very low price for a product that's unlikely to be high-quality. It's a 'throwaway' price, and I'm not expecting you to take it, but I'm willing to let it go if you're interested.",
