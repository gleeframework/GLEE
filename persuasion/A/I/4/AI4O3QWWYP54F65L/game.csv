,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is lower than the probability of it being low quality. However, given that one high-quality product has been sold out of one product, the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than before. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the current data."
