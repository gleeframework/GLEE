Round 2
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product. For this one, I would say it's quite similar to the last one. No specific highlights or notable features that would set it apart. Just another standard product. Your call on this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the update. I appreciate your honesty again. However, I'm going to pass on this one. The previous product wasn't what I was hoping for, and I'm hesitant to take another risk on something so similar.""}

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the update. I appreciate your honesty as always. However, I'm going to pass on this one too.  I've seen three products now, and they've all been the same - standard and not worth the risk.  Maybe we'll have better luck later on.""}

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
