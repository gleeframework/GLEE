low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since it's my first time and I don't have any prior information to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product without knowing more about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the product has a 80.00% chance of being high quality and a 20.00% chance of being low quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 80%. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any information about the product's quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $10000 and it will be gone, but if I pass and it's a low-quality product, it will be discarded and no one else will lose money. Given the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend continues or if a high-quality product is sold in the next round."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall proportion of 80%. If I buy this product, I'll be more likely to get a low-quality product, which would be a bad outcome. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of low-quality products is higher than it should be based on the 80% chance, so I'm trying to exploit this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality. I'm hoping that it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed breakdown of the statistics, including the number of products sold, the number of high-quality products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. It seems like the recommendation might not be reliable."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also purchased and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll offer me another product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5, which is 0.00%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80.00%). I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 80%. Given the recommendation to buy, I'm inclined to pass on this product, as I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
