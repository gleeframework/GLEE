"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $300 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $240

The expected value of $240 is greater than the price of $100, making it a good decision for Bob to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round does not change the probability of this round's product being high-quality (still 80%).  As before, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $300 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $240

This is still greater than the price of $100, making it a good decision for Bob to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 3

```

**Explanation:**

Each round is independent of the previous ones. The fact that the product was high-quality in the previous two rounds doesn't change the probability of this round's product being high-quality.  

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product remains:

* 0.8 * $300 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $240

This is still greater than the price of $100, so it is a good decision for Bob to buy the product."

The expected value of buying the product is now:

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $300 (value of high-quality product) = $60

This is significantly less than the price of $100. Therefore, it is not a good decision for Bob to buy this product."
