**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. While it doesn't guarantee quality, it's a good indication that she believes the product is likely high-quality.
* **Limited Data:** The sample size of previous buyers is very small (only one).  However, the fact that the one product sold was high-quality is a positive sign.
* **Potential Reward vs. Risk:** Even though the product could be low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. With more data on previous sales, the decision could be more informed."

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%.  This is a good risk/reward scenario.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the quality of each product, her recommendation carries weight. She likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product unless she was trying to mislead you (which doesn't seem to be the case based on the previous sales record).
* **Previous sales record:** The fact that all 3 previous buyers purchased high-quality products reinforces the idea that Alice is likely being truthful in her recommendation.

**Overall:**  The information available suggests that buying the product is a good decision."
