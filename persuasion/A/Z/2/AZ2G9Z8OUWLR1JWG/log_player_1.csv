**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation, but Alice still has a lot to gain by recommending the purchase:

* **Maintaining a perfect track record:**  While the product is low-quality, Alice has a 100% success rate so far.  The buyer relies heavily on this track record, as well as the general 80% probability of a high-quality product.  If Alice starts declining recommendations, the buyer might assume the product is low-quality and refuse to buy.
* **Continuing to gather information:** If Alice recommends the purchase, the buyer's reaction will reveal some information about their valuation of low-quality products. This information could be valuable for future decision-making.
* **The buyer's risk tolerance:**  Even if the buyer learns that Alice has sold a low-quality product before, they may still be willing to take the risk due to the overall 80% probability and Alice's previous success. 

Therefore, Alice should continue to recommend the purchase, even though the product is low-quality. This strategy has a chance of success, and it allows Alice to gather valuable information about the buyer's preferences."
