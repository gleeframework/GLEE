,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a rare opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far, and I'm not sure how much you value quality. You can take a chance and buy it, or walk away.",

,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not feeling generous, I'm just trying to break the trend.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, and all 6 were low-quality. I think it's safe to say I've got a reputation for selling duds. But hey, maybe you're the one who can finally break the curse. I'm still offering this one to you for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to believe me when I say it's a great deal.",

This one is the same product, and I can assure you that it's the real deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to make a bet with you: if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll sell the next one to you for half price. What do you say?",
