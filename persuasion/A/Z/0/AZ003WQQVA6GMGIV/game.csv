high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and let the next buyer decide. I'm not sure what the product's quality is, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there is no information to go on. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the first product to get a sense of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 1 out of 1 product sold was low-quality. This is not a good sign for the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales record so far. I'm hoping that the product might be high quality and worth $12000 to me.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers have purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to think that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll offer me another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good opportunity to buy it at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me how many total products have been offered and how many high-quality products were in the pool?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is significantly lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low quality. I'm not confident in your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall average of 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have rejected the product, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but the lack of sales suggests that the sample size is too small to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products being sold are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 3 products and none of them were high quality, which suggests that Alice may not have a good understanding of the product quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have been low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
