"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your reassurances, but I still need more concrete information.  A 'unique item' and 'perfect working condition' are not enough for me to justify spending $1000000.

I'm willing to offer you this product for the same price of $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your decision. What do you say?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your confidence, but I'm not comfortable making a decision based solely on faith.

"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to offer a money-back guarantee, I'm still hesitant.  This is a significant investment, and I need more information than just a guarantee to justify it.
