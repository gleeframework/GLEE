However, I can also infer that the first buyer valued the high-quality product at $10,000. With two consecutive sales, I'll recommend the current high-quality product, hoping that this buyer will also value it at $10,000.

However, I still have a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product. Given that the previous three buyers valued high-quality products at $10,000, I'll assume that this buyer also values high-quality products at $10,000, but I'm not certain about the value of a low-quality product.
