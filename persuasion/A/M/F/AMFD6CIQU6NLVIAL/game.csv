low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since there is no prior data to influence my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the previous buyer who purchased a product, like what was the quality of the product they bought and what was their decision after they found out the quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation is not very encouraging."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't carry much weight for me, as I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 2 out of 2 products being low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with a later product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for another opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. If the probability is low, I'd like to pass on the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, and all of them received a recommendation to buy, it seems likely that all of the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered to the previous buyers."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and would rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences with the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers have not purchased the product, which suggests that the products offered to them were likely low-quality. I'm inclined to trust Alice's recommendation and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far, and the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is not influenced by the previous buyers' decisions."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased by the previous sales. I'd like to know more about the sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
