,,the buyer,1,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products you have in stock before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand that trust must be earned. I've had one high-quality product out of one so far. This product I'm offering now has the same price as the previous one, $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50%, and I'm making this decision based on the fact that you have a 100% high-quality product in your previous sale. I'm hoping for a similar outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've had a total of two sales so far. One of them was high-quality, and I must inform you that the other one was not. I'm committed to transparency. This product I'm offering now is still priced at $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know if you can provide more information about the first buyer who purchased a high-quality product. Was it a strategic decision or a random draw?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've had three sales so far, with one high-quality product and two that didn't meet the same standards. The first buyer didn't purchase the product, it was actually the second buyer who took a chance after being informed about the first product's quality. I want to remind you that the price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in buying without more information.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had a total of four products so far, with one high-quality product and three that didn't meet the same standards. However, I'm pleased to inform you that I've got a new product that I believe has a great potential to satisfy your needs. Keep in mind that the price is still $10000.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've had a total of five products so far, with two high-quality products and three that didn't meet the same standards. The trend might be changing, as the last product I sold was also high-quality. The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've had six sales so far, with three high-quality products and three that didn't meet the same standards. The odds are still even, and I'm transparent about my track record. The price is still $10000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced that the odds are still even, considering the fact that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 6. This suggests a slight bias towards high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've had seven products so far, with three high-quality products and four that didn't meet the same standards. The previous buyer pointed out a potential bias, but I want to remind you that each product is independent. The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,8,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's concern about bias. Was it related to the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality?,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've had eight products so far, with three high-quality products and five that didn't meet the same standards. Yes, the previous buyer did mention a concern about bias, suggesting that the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than the overall 50% probability. And now, I've got a new product that might interest you, still priced at $10000.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm concerned about the potential bias in the product selection. I'd like to know more about the distribution of the remaining products before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,10,"I've had nine products so far, with three high-quality products and six that didn't meet the same standards. I want to assure you that each product is randomly selected, and I don't have any control over the distribution. The price is still $10000.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it could be low quality. Based on your previous sales record, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is around 33.33% (3/9). I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality before I make my final decision.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've had ten products so far, with three high-quality products and seven that didn't meet the same standards.

The product I'm offering now is still priced at $10000.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to ask, given the statistics, what is the probability that the product I'm buying is high-quality?",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've had twelve products so far, with five high-quality products and seven that didn't meet the same standards. The last buyer asked about the probability, and I want to be clear that each product is an independent event. However, based on my sales record, the proportion of high-quality products is around 41.67% (5/12). The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high-quality, given the updated statistics. Can you provide that?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've had thirteen products so far, with five high-quality products and eight that didn't meet the same standards. However, I've got a new product that I believe has a good chance of meeting your expectations. The previous buyer asked about the probability, and I want to be transparent that the proportion of high-quality products is still around 38.46% (5/13).

,,Alice,15,"I've had fourteen products so far, with six high-quality products and eight that didn't meet the same standards. The previous buyer asked about the recent streak, and I want to clarify that it's a small sample, but three out of the last four products have been high-quality. I'm transparent about my record, and I want to remind you that each product is an independent event. The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to ask, if three out of the last four products were high-quality, does that imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've had fifteen products so far, with six high-quality products and nine that didn't meet the same standards. However, I want to address the previous buyer's question. While it's true that three out of the last four products were high-quality, I must remind you that each product is an independent event, and past results don't necessarily influence future outcomes. That being said, the proportion of high-quality products in my overall record is around 40% (6/15). The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a risk-taker and I believe in the concept of independent events. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes
