,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the current statistics. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but your previous recommendations suggest a high likelihood of low-quality products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales as well as the total number of products sold."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0. This makes me think that the product offered to me is likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. However, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, as I think the potential reward is worth the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases?"
