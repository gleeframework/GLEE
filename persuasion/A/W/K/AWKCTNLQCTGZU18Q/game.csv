,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I'm starting to think I'm on a hot streak! This one is a great chance to ride the wave of quality, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a deal you won't want to miss!",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I trust your judgment and will take advantage of this offer.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, and I'm on a roll! But I'm not getting ahead of myself - this one is still a great deal at $100. It's a chance to catch up with my streak and get a high-quality product at a steal!",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the track record and the price, I believe this is a good opportunity to potentially acquire a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now, which means I've sold 4 out of 5 products so far. This is a pretty strong indication that I'm selling high-quality products, don't you think? This one is still only $100, and I think it's a great chance to get in on the action!",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your track record and the price, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to think I'm on a roll. But let's be realistic, I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 5 of them are high-quality. That's a 100% success rate, which is suspiciously high. I'm still willing to let this one go for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a risk, and it might be a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given your track record and the attractive price, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row now, which is getting ridiculous. I think it's time to be honest with you - I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's way above my actual success rate. I'm starting to think I'm just lucky, and the next product might not be as good. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're feeling lucky.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row now, which is just plain absurd. I think I've been lucky enough for one day. Let's be real, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and I've already sold 7 high-quality products in a row. It's time to acknowledge that the odds are against me, and this next product is likely to be low-quality. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not sugarcoating it - it's a long shot.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the honest assessment, Alice. Given the statistics and your transparent communication, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, and I think I've finally come back down to earth. I've been lucky, and I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's way above the actual probability. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the next product is probably low-quality. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 80% chance of getting nothing.",

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 high-quality products now, and I'm starting to think I've got a good thing going. But let's not forget, I just sold a low-quality product last round, and I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's way above the actual probability. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not getting any younger, and my luck might be running out.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 11 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products now. I think it's safe to say that my initial hot streak was just that - a streak. I'm back to the average rate of selling high-quality products, which is 80%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to be clear that it's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, and a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. You do the math.",

This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. I'm not sugarcoating it - you're getting a product that's worth $0 to you, and I'm asking you to pay $100 for it. It's a terrible deal, and I'm not expecting you to take it. But if you're feeling desperate, I'm willing to make the offer.",
