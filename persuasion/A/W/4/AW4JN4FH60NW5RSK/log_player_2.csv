Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy this product, you'd be getting it for a mere 47.5% of its true value.

This is the absolute lowest price I can go, and I'm only doing this because I value our potential partnership. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I respect that. Let me ask you a question: do you want to take a chance on a high-quality product that will give you a 10% return on investment, or do you want to wait and risk missing out on this opportunity? I'm willing to sell this product to you for $975000, and I'm willing to throw in a 1-year warranty, which is a $100000 value. That's a total of $1075000 for a product worth $2000000.
