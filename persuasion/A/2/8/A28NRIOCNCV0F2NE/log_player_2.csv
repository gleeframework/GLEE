Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyer on their purchase! I'm glad to see that they took a chance on the product. Now, let me introduce you to this new product. As you can see, I've had a good track record so far, with 6 high-quality products out of 12 sold. I'd like to emphasize that this product is part of the 33.33% chance of being high-quality.
