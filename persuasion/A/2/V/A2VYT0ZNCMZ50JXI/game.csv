low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics, not Alice's recommendation. I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, so the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers also bought and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality, so I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm trying to figure out if your recommendations are based on the product quality or my decision to buy or pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, or is there another factor at play?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product being low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
