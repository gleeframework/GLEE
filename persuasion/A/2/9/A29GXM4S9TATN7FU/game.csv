I'm willing to let this product go for $750000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a lower price... or at least, a product that's worth a lot to you, even if it's not one of my best.",

I'll let this product go for $500000, which is a very low price for a product of this quality. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.

I'm willing to let this one go for $450000, which is an extremely low price for a product of this quality. If you pass on this one, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in any of my products, and I'll have to move on to the next customer. So, what do you say?",
