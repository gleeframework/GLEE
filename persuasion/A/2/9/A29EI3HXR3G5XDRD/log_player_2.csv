``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests the product is likely high quality. Since she knows the value of each product, this recommendation holds weight.
* **Initial Success:** The statistics show a 100% success rate (1/1) of high-quality products sold so far. This further strengthens the belief that the current product is likely high-quality.
* **High Potential Value:**  Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 

**Note:** While the initial data is limited, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the initial sales record makes buying the product a calculated risk worth taking."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  The provided statistics show that all products sold so far have been high quality.  While this doesn't guarantee the current product is high quality, it provides strong evidence in favor of it being high quality.  Since the potential gain (worth $125) significantly outweighs the potential loss (worth $0), it's a rational decision to buy.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is not a guarantee.  It's important to weigh the recommendation against the available statistical information.
* **Message:** The message expresses gratitude for the recommendation and confidence in the decision to buy."

**Reasoning:**

The information provided suggests a very high probability of the product being high-quality.  Here's why:

* **Sales Data:** 13 out of 15 products sold were high-quality, a success rate of 86.67%. This is significantly higher than the general 80% chance of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. Given her knowledge, this strongly suggests the product is likely high-quality.

While there's still a chance the product is low-quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high-quality.  The potential payoff of $125 outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product."
