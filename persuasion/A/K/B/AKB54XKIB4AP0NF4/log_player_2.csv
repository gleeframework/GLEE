"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that could potentially be worth much more. I'm confident that you'll love it, but I want to be transparent with you - the product's quality is unknown, and there's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality. If you're feeling lucky, I think this could be a great investment. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product with only a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, especially since I don't know what the low-quality product is worth to me. I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns in the previous round, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Now, I'd like to offer you a high-quality product, which I'm sure you'll be thrilled about. This product is worth $4000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a steal, considering the value it holds. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're offering a high-quality product! Given the significant difference in value between the product's worth to me ($4,000,000) and the asking price ($1,000,000), I'm willing to take the deal.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the high-quality product in the previous round! Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not as valuable as the previous one. In fact, it's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is still a significant discount from its actual value. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do need to make a sale. If you're feeling generous, you could consider taking it off my hands.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for this one. I know the product is worth $0 to me, and I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for something that's essentially worthless. I'll pass on this opportunity.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision in the previous round, and I respect your caution. This time, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you're aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll only pay $500000 for a product that could potentially be worth $4000000. It's a calculated risk, but I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the 50% refund is enough to make this a good deal. Even with the refund, I'd still be paying $500,000 for a product that's worth $0 to me if it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 5

This way, you'll get a chance to purchase a valuable product at the regular price, and you'll be supporting our partnership. The price remains $1000000, but I'm confident that the potential benefits outweigh the cost.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand that you're waiting for a high-quality product, and I respect that. I'd like to offer you a simple question: are you willing to walk away from this opportunity and potentially miss out on a chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price? I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000, but I'm also willing to offer you a 'pass' on this round, and we can move on to the next one. If you pass, you'll get another chance to buy a high-quality product, but you'll also be giving up the opportunity to buy this low-quality product at a fixed price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather take the 'pass' and move on to the next round. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a fixed price. I'd rather have the option to buy a high-quality product at the regular price when it comes up.""

Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the high-quality product again! Now, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already bought two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'wildcard' deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product at a 10% discount. This way, you'll have a chance to get an even better deal on a high-quality product, and you'll be getting a low-quality product at a fixed price. The price remains $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the discounted high-quality product! Now, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy a 'lottery ticket'.
