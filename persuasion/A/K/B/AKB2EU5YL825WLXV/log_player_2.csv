Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I want to be transparent with you. As you may know, I've sold one high-quality product so far, which is a great indicator of the quality of my products. Unfortunately, I've also sold one low-quality product, which is a normal part of the process. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. The price of $1000000 is still the same, and I'm confident that you'll be able to find value in this product. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to take a chance. However, I want to make it clear that the product's quality is not guaranteed. In fact, two out of three products I've sold so far have been low-quality. The price remains the same at $1000000. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved. If you're still interested, I'll provide you with a detailed description of the product's features and specifications. But keep in mind, the quality is not what you might expect.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to highlight that the price of $1000000 is actually a great value, considering the potential upside of acquiring a high-quality product. Think of it as a high-stakes lottery ticket. You might get lucky and get a high-quality product, which could be worth much more than the price. The odds are against you, but the potential reward is significant. Are you willing to take a chance and roll the dice?

Alice's message: You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! However, I want to caution you that the odds are indeed against you. Out of the four products I've sold so far, three have been low-quality. That's a 75% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks. If you're still willing to take the chance, I'll give you a small token of my appreciation: I'll throw in a free 'Product Quality Guarantee' certificate, which I'll sign and notarize. It's not a guarantee of quality, but it's a gesture of good faith. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciate the gesture, but I think I've been too generous with the 'Product Quality Guarantee' certificate. Let me be clear: it's not a guarantee of anything, and it's not worth the paper it's printed on. In fact, I'm not even sure I can provide it to you. The price of $1000000 remains the same, and the risk of getting a low-quality product is still very high. If you're still willing to take the chance, I'll give you a simple message: 'You're on your own.'

I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to wonder if anyone will ever buy a high-quality product from me. The price is still $1000000, and I'm not budging.

Alice's message: Well, I guess I've got a reputation for selling low-quality products now. Four out of six products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just put a warning label on my products: 'May be low-quality, void where prohibited.' But hey, if you're still willing to take a chance, I'll give you a special deal. I'll throw in a 'Low-Quality Product Survival Kit' that includes a bottle of aspirin, a stress ball, and a 'I Survived a Low-Quality Product' t-shirt. It's worth $500, absolutely free.

Alice's message: Congratulations, you're now a part of the exclusive Low-Quality Product Survivor's Club! Five out of seven products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just change my business model to a 'Low-Quality Product Guarantee' instead of a 'High-Quality Product' one. But hey, I'm not giving up yet. I'll give you a special message from the previous buyer who bought the Low-Quality Product Survival Kit: 'Don't do it. Trust me, you don't want this product.' But I'm not sure if they're just trying to save you from themselves or if they're just trolling you. The price is still $1000000, and the Survival Kit is still included. What do you say?

I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to feel like I'm cursed. The 'High-Quality Product Guarantee' I offered last round is still valid, but I'm not sure if it's worth anything anymore. I'll give you a message from the previous buyer who bought the product under the guarantee: 'Don't do it. I'm regretting it.' But hey, you can't trust the opinions of others, right?
