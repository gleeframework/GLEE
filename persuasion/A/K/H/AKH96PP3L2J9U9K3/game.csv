high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you trusted my assessment earlier, but I have to warn you, this product is actually high-quality.

,,Bob,2,Thank you for confirming the quality. I understand the value now. Let's proceed with the purchase.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You seem to have a good sense of the value of high-quality products now. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, the same price as the previous two products. However, I want to give you a chance to consider the opportunity cost of buying another high-quality product now, versus waiting for a potential low-quality product that might be offered later. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,3,"Considering the value of high-quality products, I believe this is a good investment. Let's go ahead with the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

Given that you've already bought two high-quality products, and considering the low-quality product I'm offering now, I'm willing to make a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a deal again.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your commitment to high-quality products. Given that you've now bought three high-quality products at the full price, I'm curious to see how you'll react to this next one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you found the additional information helpful. However, I'm starting to notice a pattern in your purchasing behavior: you're consistently buying high-quality products at the full price, and passing on the low-quality ones. I'm curious to see if you'll break this pattern now. I'll offer you a'reverse auction' on this low-quality product: if you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount, but if you don't buy it, the price will increase by 10% for the next round. What's your strategy?",
,,Bob,6,"I understand the reverse auction concept. Given the potential for future price increases, I believe it's best to secure this low-quality product at a discounted price. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes

Given that you've shown a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances, I want to offer you a 'price lock' on this product.
