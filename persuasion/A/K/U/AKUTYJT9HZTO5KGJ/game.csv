,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take the first product since the expected value is $15000, which is higher than the price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality, I'll ignore it and make my decision based on the 50% chance of the product being high-quality. The expected value remains $15000, which is still higher than the price of $10000."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"The previous results don't change the probability of the current product being high-quality. It's still 50%, and the expected value remains $15000. I'll continue to buy the products as long as the expected value is higher than the price of $10000."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"The pattern of Alice's recommendations and the quality of the products doesn't seem to be correlated. I'll keep making my decisions based on the expected value, which remains $15000. I'll buy the product since the expected value is still higher than the price of $10000."
