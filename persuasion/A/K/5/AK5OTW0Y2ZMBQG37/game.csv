high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,

,,Alice,3,"For the third time in a row, I have a high-quality product for sale. Given that you've now bought two high-quality products for $100 each, I'm starting to think that you might be getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100 as well, but I have to ask: are you getting tired of buying high-quality products at this price point?",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three for three! I'm glad you're enjoying the high-quality streak. However, I have to admit that I'm starting to wonder if you're taking advantage of my generosity.

,,Bob,4,"You're not fooling anyone with the 'quality guarantee', I'll take it for $100",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Seven in a row! I think it's time to shake things up a bit. I'll be completely honest with you - I've been wondering if you're just buying these high-quality products because you think you're getting a good deal, or if you actually value them for their quality. I'll give you a chance to prove it. If you're willing to pay $100 for this product, I'll give you a 'quality certification' that proves its authenticity. But if you're not willing to pay the full price, I'll give you a chance to negotiate.",
