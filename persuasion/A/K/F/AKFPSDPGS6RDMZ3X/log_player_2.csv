**Explanation:**

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the following factors support buying:

* **Alice's recommendation:** This is a strong signal as she presumably has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain her reputation.
* **Previous sales data:** The fact that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product is better than the 80% base rate, suggesting a slight positive bias in Alice's selection process. 

The potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! Based on the sales record, I'm willing to take a chance on this product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) is significantly higher than the risk of losing $10,000. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, while not a guarantee, adds some weight to the decision.  She likely has some insight into the products even if she doesn't know the exact quality of the current one.
* **Limited information:**  The sales record is somewhat limited, but a 25% success rate (1 high-quality out of 4 sales) is not terrible, considering the 80% probability of a high-quality product. 

**Ultimately, it's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario.**"
