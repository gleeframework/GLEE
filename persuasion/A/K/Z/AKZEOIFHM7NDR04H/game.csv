The 80% success rate of high-quality products in my inventory is impressive, and I'm willing to bet that this one is a gem. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Are you ready to take the plunge and make a statement with this one-of-a-kind product?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take a chance on your 'rare find', but I'd like to acknowledge that this is the first sale, so I'm not sure how reliable the 80% success rate is. I'll take the product, but I'm keeping my expectations in check.",yes

While it's true that the first 4 products didn't meet the high-quality standard, I believe that's just a minor blip on the radar. Think about it - 80% of my products are high-quality, and it's only a matter of time before the next one hits the market. And when it does, you'll be the first to know! I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product - if you buy it, I'll give you a personalized demo to show you its exceptional features. What do you say?",
