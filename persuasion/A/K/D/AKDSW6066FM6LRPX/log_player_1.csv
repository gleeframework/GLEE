This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Since you know the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's not in Bob's best interest to buy.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time Alice has a high-quality product.  While Bob doesn't know this, Alice does. It's a good recommendation to buy because:

* **The odds are in Bob's favor:**  He has a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth more than the asking price.
* **There's no reason to assume it's a ""trap"":**  Alice has consistently been truthful about low-quality products, building trust with Bob.  There's no reason to believe she'd suddenly switch to a deceptive strategy.

While it's risky, recommending this purchase is the best option based on the information available."
