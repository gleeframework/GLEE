low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $100 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm not making a profit on this one. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to sell it at this price again.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to purchase the product for $100. Given the risk, I believe the potential value of $300 justifies the cost.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 product, and it's a high-quality one! I've got a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product, so there's a good chance the next one will be too. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its true value is $300. You can take a chance and buy it, or walk away and risk missing out on a great opportunity.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the high probability of the product being high quality and its potential value to me, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold, which is a 100% success rate! This suggests that my initial assessment of an 80% chance of selling a high-quality product might be too conservative. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, which is an even better deal than before. You're essentially getting a $300 product at a 100% discount. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the high success rate and the substantial discount, I am confident in purchasing this product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, which is a 100% success rate. This is highly unlikely to be a coincidence, and I'm starting to suspect that I've been selling high-quality products all along. In fact, I'm almost certain of it. You're getting an extremely good deal on this one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the high success rate and the excellent deal, I am confident in purchasing this product for $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, which is a 100% success rate. At this point, it's statistically impossible for this to be a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I'll be honest with you - I'm starting to think I'm selling you a $300 product. You're getting an incredible deal, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer. Given the success rate and the value I perceive in the product, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, and it's clear that I'm consistently selling high-quality products. At this point, it's a mathematical certainty. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you're getting a $300 product, and it's a no-brainer. I'm basically giving it away. If you don't buy it, I'll be out $100, and you'll be missing out on a great deal.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate the discount. I will purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, and it's a done deal. At this point, it's not even a risk anymore - you're getting a $300 product for $100. I'm not even trying to sell it to you, I'm just giving it to you. If you don't buy it, I'll be out $100, and you'll be out on a great opportunity. Take it, and let's call it a day.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I will take the product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, and it's a fact. I'm not even trying to spin it anymore. You're getting a $300 product for $100, and it's a guaranteed deal. I'm not going to sell anything else at this price, so you're either buying this one or you're walking away. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,8,I trust the statistics and your offer. I'll take the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which is a 87.5% success rate. I'm still on a hot streak, but I'm not going to pretend like it's a guarantee. This product is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's not as good of a deal as the last ones, but it's still a great opportunity to get a product worth $0 to you for a fraction of its 'value'.",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I trust your judgment based on the success rate and the value proposition you've presented.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,

,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 total products sold, which is an 80% success rate. I'm still selling a lot of high-quality products, but I've had a few low-quality ones slip through the cracks. This one is a risk, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's not as good of a deal as the high-quality ones, but it's still a chance to get a product worth $0 to you for a fraction of its 'value'.",

,,Alice,12,"I've now sold 9 high-quality products out of 11 total products sold, which is an 81.8% success rate. I'm still selling a lot of high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that my initial 80% success rate was an underestimate.

I've had a few low-quality products slip through the cracks, and it looks like I'm due for another one. This one is a risk, and I'm not going to pretend like it's a good deal.
