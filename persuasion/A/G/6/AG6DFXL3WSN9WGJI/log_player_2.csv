**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information about the specific product we're looking at. 
* **Past Success:** The past sales record is encouraging. Two high-quality products have been sold out of two purchases. This suggests Alice is likely providing accurate recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a higher chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided.  In a real-world scenario, we'd want more data and potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price."

**Explanation:**

* **High sale rate:**  The fact that 4 out of 7 buyers received high-quality products (57% success rate) is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. This suggests Alice might have some insight into product quality, even if she doesn't know the specific value to each buyer. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. Even if her insights aren't perfect, she seems to have a better than random chance of identifying high-quality products. 
* **Potential reward:** The potential gain of $2,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, a buyer would need to consider other factors like the cost of the product, their own risk tolerance, and the potential consequences of a bad decision."
