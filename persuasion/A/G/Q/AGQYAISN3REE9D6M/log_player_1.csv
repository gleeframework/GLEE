"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products.
* You know the product is high-quality.
* The price is $100, which could be a good deal for the buyer if they value the high-quality product at more than $100.
* There's no information about the buyer's risk aversion or their willingness to take a chance on a new seller.

Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to buy the product. The worst-case scenario is that the buyer values the product at exactly $100, in which case they neither gain nor lose from the purchase."
