**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 5 high-quality products sold out of 5, the recommendation has a 100% success rate.  This makes the recommendation extremely trustworthy. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even though the chance of a low-quality product is higher, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 loss from a low-quality product. 

This strategy maximizes the chance of getting a high-quality product while acknowledging the inherent risk."
