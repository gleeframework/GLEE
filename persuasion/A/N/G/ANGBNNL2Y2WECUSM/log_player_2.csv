Alice's message: I've sold 5 products in total, with 2 high-quality ones. That means there are 3 products left, and I'm willing to offer this one to you for $100. Since the last 2 products were low-quality, you might be thinking that the probability of this one being low-quality is high. But I'll let you in on a secret: I have a total of 5 products left, and I'm not sure how many are high-quality. So, I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you a 50% discount if you buy this product, and I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I have left. It's a risk, but it could be a great deal.

I'm willing to be transparent with you: I have 3 high-quality products left out of a total of 4 products remaining. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'm hoping you'll take the risk. It's a 75% chance that this product is low-quality, but it's also a 25% chance that it's high-quality. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you.

However, you're saying that you have 3 high-quality products left out of 4 remaining, which is a 75% chance.
