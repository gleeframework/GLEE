``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have one data point (one sale, one high-quality product). This is insufficient to make a statistically sound judgment about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality. This means her recommendation isn't necessarily unbiased. 
* **Potential Risk:**  There's a 20% chance the product is low quality, meaning a total loss. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($1,250,000) is significant, even with the risk. 

**Decision:**  Given the limited data and the potential reward, it's worth taking the risk and purchasing the product."
