"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Value:**  The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $1,250,000 to the buyer.
* **Positive Expected Value:**  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Even though the product is $1,000,000, the potential gain of $250,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Calculation:**

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000

The expected value of the product is equal to the price, so it is a reasonable decision for the buyer to purchase the product."
