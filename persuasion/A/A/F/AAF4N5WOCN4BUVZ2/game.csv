Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance on it. I know that 1 out of 2 products were sold and 1 was high quality. Since the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high quality is also 50%. Given that the last product didn't meet expectations, I'm not going to let that information affect my decision. I'll take the product and hope for the best!",yes
