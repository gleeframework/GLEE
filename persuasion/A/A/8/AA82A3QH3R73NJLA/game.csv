,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know that I'm not missing out on any information. Can you tell me the probability that this product is high quality based on the current data?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will have a better outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the product's quality, and she's trying to make a sale. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of the first buyer bought the product, and that product was low quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
