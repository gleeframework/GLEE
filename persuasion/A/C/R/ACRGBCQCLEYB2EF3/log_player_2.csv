Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product from me. As you can see, I've sold 1 out of 1 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. I'm sure you're wondering what this means. Let me put it this way: the odds are against you. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?

Alice's message: Ahah, no worries! The product didn't quite meet expectations, but that's all part of the process. Let me fill you in on how it works. As you can see, I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. This means that the chances of the next product being high-quality are still quite low. But, I'm willing to bet that the next one will be a winner! Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?

Alice's message: Ahah, I see you're being cautious! That's smart. Well, let me give you an update. I've sold 1 out of 3 products so far, and 1 of them were high-quality. This means that the chances of the next product being high-quality are starting to look up! In fact, with 1 out of 3 being high-quality, it's likely that the next one will be a winner.

Alice's message: Fair enough! I understand you're being cautious. Let me give you some more information. I'm expecting to sell this product for $100, and for me, it's worth $0 to me. So, you're essentially getting a product that has no value to me, and you're paying $100 for it. Of course, there's always a chance it could be a high-quality product, but the odds are against it.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! Unfortunately, it was a low-quality product, but I'm glad you were willing to take the risk. Now, let's talk about the next product. I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, and 1 of them were high-quality. This means that the chances of the next product being high-quality are even higher!
