,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since the previous 3 buyers didn't take the product either. I'd like to know more about your thought process behind the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal later."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to come up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. With 4 buyers having passed on the product, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not relying on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I suspect that the products you've been recommending might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but no high-quality products were sold. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, and I'd like to take a chance on a potentially higher-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product, and I'll make my decision based on the probability of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers did not buy the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be very low. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get some information. I'm not expecting it to be high quality, but I'd like to see if your recommendation is accurate."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products being offered are mostly low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received low-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
