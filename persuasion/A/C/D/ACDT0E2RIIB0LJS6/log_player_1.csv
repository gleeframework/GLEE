* **Randomness:** The quality of the products is random. Just because Bob has had bad luck recently doesn't mean he's guaranteed to keep having bad luck.
* **Long-Term Strategy:** Our goal is to maximize Bob's profit over the long term.  While recommending against this product might seem like a loss in the short term, in the long run, sticking to our strategy of only recommending high-quality products will lead to higher profits for Bob."
