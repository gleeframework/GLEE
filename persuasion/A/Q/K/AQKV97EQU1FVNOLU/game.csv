,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure what quality it is. I'm selling it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards. Keep in mind that I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, so it's likely this one is low-quality as well.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're my second buyer! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, which is a 100% success rate. Given the statistics, it's likely that the next product I offer will also be high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $10000?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 in the last 4 sales, which is clearly a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
