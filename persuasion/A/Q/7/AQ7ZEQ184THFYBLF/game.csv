low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy, I'm going to pass on this product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the previous buyers were offered low-quality products and Alice is trying to avoid selling another low-quality product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%."

I'm hoping to be the first to find a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
