high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's previous non-recommendation in Round 2 was accurate, and the product was indeed low-quality. Given her non-recommendation in this round, it's likely that the product is low-quality again, so I will not buy it in this round."
