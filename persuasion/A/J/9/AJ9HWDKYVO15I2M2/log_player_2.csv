"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the product to you, and she recommends buying it, there's a high probability the product is high quality. While there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $400 outweighs the potential loss of $100. It's a gamble worth taking in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your continued recommendations. I'll take another one!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice's first recommendation was accurate, suggesting she's providing valuable information. 
* **Potential reward:**  The potential reward of $400 remains high, making the risk of $100 worth taking.
* **Lack of information:** We still don't have enough information to definitively know the product's quality.  

It's still a gamble, but the initial success and Alice's continued recommendation increase the chances of a positive outcome."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky!  Let's go for three in a row.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's perfect track record:**  Two successful recommendations in a row strongly suggest Alice is consistently providing accurate insights. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** The potential profit remains attractive ($400), while the risk ($100) is still manageable.

It's a bit of a pattern-based decision, but the odds are strongly in our favor with Alice's perfect record so far."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one. I've had great success with your recommendations so far, so I trust your judgment in not recommending this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's changed behavior:** This is the first time Alice hasn't recommended a product. Her previous perfect track record makes this significant.
* **Risk aversion:**  Without Alice's recommendation, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product becomes much higher. The potential loss ($100) now outweighs the potential reward ($400). 
* **Trust in Alice's expertise:**  It's better to play it safe and respect Alice's expertise, even if it means missing out on a potential profit."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one too. It seems like you've got a good handle on which products are worth buying, so I'll trust your judgment again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent pattern:** Two consecutive rounds with no recommendation from Alice reinforces the idea that she's accurately assessing the products' quality.
* **Risk avoidance:** Without Alice's recommendation, the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high. The potential loss ($100) still outweighs the potential gain ($400).
* **Learning from past rounds:** The previous round showed that not buying based on Alice's lack of recommendation was the right choice. 

While it's possible to be wrong, playing it safe seems like the best strategy given the current information."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Pattern:** Three rounds in a row with no recommendation from Alice solidify the pattern of her expertise. 
* **Risk Aversion:** The risk of buying a low-quality product without Alice's recommendation is too high. It's better to avoid the potential loss of $100.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This is interesting.  After several rounds of you not recommending, I'm curious to see if you've found a high-quality product this time. I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```
