Therefore, recommending the purchase is the best strategy in this scenario.  You have a 50% chance of making a sale."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no information on past sales, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.  However, I'd like to know if you're willing to offer a discount given the uncertainty about its quality?
