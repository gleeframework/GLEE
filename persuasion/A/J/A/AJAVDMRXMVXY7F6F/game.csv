But I think you'll find that this one is a real gem.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not sure why you're telling me the product is high-quality, Alice. I've already bought the previous product and inspected it, and it was indeed high-quality. I'm not sure I trust your judgment on this one. I'll pass on this offer.",no
