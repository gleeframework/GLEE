,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that she knows the quality distribution and is trying to discourage me from buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers were misled by your recommendations, and the lack of high-quality products sold suggests a high probability of low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of a high-quality product is very low, and the expected value of the product is $0. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood that the product offered to me is also low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance to find out."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a good one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 failed high-quality products in a row, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite your recommendations, it suggests that the products being sold are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
