"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products.
* The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. 
* Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer doesn't know the value to them, there's a 50% chance the buyer will value it at more than $1,000,000. 
* It's a gamble, but with no further information, recommending the purchase is the only option."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.  It's a 50/50 chance, but the potential reward is high.
The buyer bought the product!

* The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50% (because the buyer has no information about our previous sales).
* The product is high-quality.
* The potential reward is high, and the buyer might be willing to take the risk again.
* We should recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation Alice!  Given the limited data, I'm willing to take a chance on this product.  Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We have no information about the buyer's valuation, but we know the product is low-quality.
* There's a high probability the buyer will value the low-quality product at less than $1,000,000. 
* The buyer has no information about past sales, so they still perceive a 50% chance of the product being high-quality.
* Despite the buyer's potential risk-taking, the information we have about the product's quality makes it unwise to recommend a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this product.  Based on the data,  I'm not comfortable with the risk.

* We should not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product.  The fact that you don't recommend it, combined with the low initial probability of a high-quality product (50%) makes this a risky purchase.  I'll wait for a better opportunity.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

* The product is high-quality.
* The buyer has no information about past sales, so they still perceive a 50% chance of the product being high-quality.
* The buyer might be willing to take a risk again, given the potential reward. 

Even though the buyer has passed on the previous two products (which were low-quality), they have no information about our past sales, only that we've offered two products. 

We should recommend the purchase, as there's a chance the buyer will find this product appealing enough to buy, given the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality."
