"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering a product at a fixed price, and Bob knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, it makes sense to recommend buying.  

Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is likely positive. Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a good chance it's worth more than $10,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk of getting a low-quality product, but the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is significant.  

**Important Note:**  This recommendation assumes Bob is risk-neutral or risk-seeking. A risk-averse Bob might be hesitant to buy due to the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will take the risk and buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of Round 1 (Bob buying a high-quality product) provides no new information about the value of high-quality products to Bob.  Since the probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%, the logic from Round 1 still applies.  Bob should buy the product."

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same.  The fact that Bob bought the high-quality product in Round 2 doesn't change the probability that this round's product is also high-quality.  Therefore, the logic from the previous rounds still applies. Bob should continue buying as long as the probability of high-quality products remains 80%."
