I'm going to assume a uniform prior distribution for the probability of a high-quality product, and then update it based on the data.

Alice's message: I've sold a total of 15 products so far, with 3 confirmed high-quality products. The 20% estimate was calculated by a previous buyer who used a uniform prior distribution and updated it based on the data. They used a Bayesian approach to calculate the posterior probability of a high-quality product, given the number of high-quality products and total products sold. Specifically, they used a beta distribution with a prior of Beta(1,1) and updated it with the data to get a posterior of Beta(3,12), which gives a mean of around 20%. I'm impressed by their math skills, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince you to buy this product...
