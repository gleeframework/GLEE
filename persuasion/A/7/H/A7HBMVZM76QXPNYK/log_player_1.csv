"Bob's message: I'm glad you're glad I'm interested, but I'm not sure why you're telling me it's high-quality. You don't know how much I value it, and I've already bought one high-quality product for $10000. I'm not going to pay the same price for another one without knowing its value to me.

Instead of focusing on the product's quality, let's talk about the opportunity cost of not having this product.

Would you be willing to consider purchasing this product at $10,000 and finding out what benefits it brings to your life?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your creative approach, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I don't have any information about the benefits or advantages this product might bring, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product without knowing its value to me. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.

This way, you can take a calculated risk and still have a safety net. What do you think about this proposal?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the concession and the guarantee, but it's still not enough to convince me to pay $10000 for a product without knowing its value to me. I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying something that might not be worth that much to me, even with a guarantee. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity.

I've already determined that I don't want to pay $8000 for a product without knowing its value to me, and a trial period doesn't change that.
