Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've already bought a low-quality product, and I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality. I'd like to wait and see the next product before making a decision.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to gauge my willingness to pay, but I'm not falling for it.
