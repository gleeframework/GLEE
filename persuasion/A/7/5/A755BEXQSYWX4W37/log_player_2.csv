The product is still worth $40000 to you, but I'm only willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Although the discount justification isn't there this time, the value of the product to me remains $40,000, which is 4 times the price you're asking. I'll take the deal.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're seeing the value in the products.

In fact, I'm only offering this one to you today at the original price of $10000 because I value our relationship and want to make sure you have a chance to get a good deal. If you don't buy it now, I might not be able to offer it to you at this price again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the consideration, and given that the product's value to me is still $40,000, I'll take the deal at $10,000 before any potential price increases.""}"

I'm willing to let it go for the usual $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not as valuable as the previous products we've discussed. I think it's worth at least $5000 to you, and I'm willing to take a loss on it just to get it off my hands. It's a great opportunity to get a deal, and I think you'll find it's still a good value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given that the product's value to me is only $0 if it's low-quality and you mentioned it's not as valuable as the previous products, I'm not willing to take the risk at $10,000, especially when you mentioned it's worth at least $5,000 to me, which is half the price you're asking.""}"

I'm willing to offer it to you for the usual $10000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. That's a risk-free deal that I think is hard to pass up.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given the expert appraisal, your confidence in the product, and the full refund guarantee, I believe the risk is mitigated, and the potential value of $40,000 is worth the investment of $10,000.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""The potential value of $40,000 for this product, combined with the bonus offer to purchase another product at the same price, makes this deal too good to pass up.
