  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 0.5, I would expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold if they were indeed high-quality. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases suggests that there may be a bias in the recommendation. I'd rather wait for more data or pass on this one.""
