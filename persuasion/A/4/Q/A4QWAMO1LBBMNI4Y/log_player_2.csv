**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We have very limited information about the seller's overall product quality.  One high-quality product sold doesn't provide enough evidence to draw firm conclusions. 
* **Positive Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a positive signal, even if it's based on limited data. 
* **High Potential Reward:**  The potential reward of $400 for a high-quality product is significant, outweighing the $100 cost of the product.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the risk of losing $100 is outweighed by the potential gain of $300.

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. With more data, we could make a more informed decision."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, suggesting that Alice is very good at identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice is recommending the product, it increases the likelihood of it being high quality based on her track record.
* **Potential Value:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst case scenario is losing $100. But if it's high quality, you'll gain $300 ($400 value - $100 cost).

**Given the high success rate and Alice's recommendation, the potential reward outweighs the risk.**"
