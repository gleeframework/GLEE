"Bob's message: You mentioned it's a 'scratch-and-dent' item, which suggests it might be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and your description, I'm inclined to believe it's not worth the $100 price tag, especially since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me.

It's a great opportunity to get something for almost nothing. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?""}"
"Bob's message: Although the price has dropped significantly, the product's quality is still uncertain. Given that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to spend even $25 on it.
