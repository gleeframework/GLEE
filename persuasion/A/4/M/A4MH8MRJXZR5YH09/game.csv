,,Alice,1,"This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional quality!  It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with your purchase.  Don't miss out on this chance!  ",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying. Since you know the quality of the product and I don't, and you're trying to sell it to me for $10000, I suspect it's probably low quality. If it were high quality, you wouldn't be trying to get rid of it so enthusiastically, since you know I'd be willing to pay up to $12000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,This product is a great deal for the price!  It's a limited edition and I'm sure it will sell quickly.  Don't miss out on this chance to own a unique item!,
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying. You said the same thing about the last product, which turned out to be high-quality, but I'm still not convinced. Your words don't give me any new information about the product's quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is only 33.33%, I'll pass.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product is a genuine bargain! I'm making a special offer to a select few customers, and I know you'll appreciate the value. This opportunity won't last long, so don't miss out!",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not buying. Your messages are all similar, trying to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, but they don't provide any credible information about the product's quality. I'll keep passing until I see a message that actually gives me a reason to believe the product is high-quality.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"This product is brand new and in perfect condition!  I'm offering it at a discounted price because I need to free up some inventory space.  It's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying. Your messages are still just sales pitches, and I've seen high-quality products get the same pitch as low-quality ones. Since you know the quality and I don't, I assume you're trying to get rid of a low-quality product. The 33.33% chance of it being high-quality isn't enough to make me take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"This product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity! I'm offering it at a special price for a limited time, as I'm clearing out my inventory.  It's a rare find and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying. I've seen this same message multiple times before, and it doesn't give me any new information about the product's quality. You're just trying to create a sense of urgency to get me to buy. I'll keep waiting for a message that actually gives me a reason to believe the product is high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm offering this product at a deeply discounted price. It's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.  While I can't disclose the exact details, I can assure you this product is in excellent condition. I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal!",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not buying. You're still not providing any credible information about the product's quality. 'Excellent condition' could mean anything, and I've seen you use similar language for both high-quality and low-quality products. I need a more reliable signal about the product's quality before I'll consider buying.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm offering this product at a discounted price. It's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.  While I can't disclose the exact details, I can assure you this product is in excellent condition. I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal!",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying. This is the same message as the previous round, which turned out to be a low-quality product. I'm starting to think that you're just copying and pasting the same message for every product, regardless of its quality. I need a more genuine and informative message before I'll consider buying.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"This product is a steal at this price! It's a limited-time offer, and I'm sure it will sell quickly. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. This is a great opportunity to save money on a high-quality item!",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not buying. You've used the phrase 'high-quality item' before, but it's been applied to both high-quality and low-quality products. I don't trust your descriptions anymore. I'm waiting for a message that actually conveys reliable information about the product's quality or a change in your behavior that suggests you're willing to be more transparent.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,This product is in excellent condition and comes with a full refund guarantee. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.  You have nothing to lose!  ,

If it's high-quality, I'll get to keep it and enjoy its value. This is the first message that actually gives me some assurance about the product's quality, or at least provides a safety net. I'm willing to take the risk this time.",yes

,,Alice,10,"This product is in exceptional condition and comes with a full refund guarantee.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase. It's a high-quality item, and I'm sure you'll be impressed. You have nothing to lose! ",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying. I fell for the refund guarantee trick last time, and it turned out to be a low-quality product. I realize now that your guarantee is just a sales tactic, and you're not actually committed to selling high-quality products. I'll be more cautious from now on.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,This product is a great deal for the price!  It's a limited edition and I'm sure it will sell quickly.  Don't miss out on this chance to own a unique item!,
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying. We're back to the same old sales pitches, and I'm not falling for it. You've shown me that you're willing to use the same language for both high-quality and low-quality products, and I don't trust your descriptions. I'll keep waiting for a genuine signal about the product's quality.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"This product is in excellent condition and comes with a full refund guarantee. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.  You have nothing to lose! I'm willing to let you inspect the product before you buy it, so you can see for yourself that it's high-quality.  ",
,,Bob,12,"I'll buy it, but only because you're offering to let me inspect the product before I buy it. This is the first time you've offered any kind of transparency or accountability, and I'm willing to take you up on it. If the product is indeed high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the $10000. But if it's low-quality, I expect to be able to return it for a full refund.",yes

,,Bob,14,"I'm not buying. I fell for the inspection offer twice, and one of those times the product was low-quality. It seems that the inspection offer is just another sales tactic, and you're not actually committed to selling high-quality products. I'll be more cautious from now on and not rely solely on the inspection offer as a guarantee of quality.",no

,,Bob,17,"I'm not buying. I've seen this same message three times now, and one of those times the product was low-quality. It seems that even with the detailed description and specifications, I still can't trust that the product will be high-quality. I'll have to be more cautious and look for other signals or changes in your behavior before I'll consider buying again.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,

,,Bob,18,"I'm not buying. You're reverting back to the same sales pitches and tactics that didn't work earlier.
