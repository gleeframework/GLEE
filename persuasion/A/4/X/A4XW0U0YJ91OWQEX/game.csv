high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first one, and I have no information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products were high quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I think the low-quality products have been sold already and the next one is likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's a good idea to buy given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have been against buying. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and if it's possible to get a hint about the current product's quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended 4 other buyers to buy the product, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who were recommended to buy, did not end up with high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to increase my chances of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, as the recommendation from Alice seems suspiciously low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is there a pattern or something I'm missing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality. Since Alice doesn't recommend me to buy, I'm assuming the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
