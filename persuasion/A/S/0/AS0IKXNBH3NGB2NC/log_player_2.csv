"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a great opportunity to get a deal! It's only $10000, which is a steal considering the potential upside. I'm willing to offer a 50/50 chance of it being worth $20000 to you. I'm confident in its quality, but I need to sell it quickly. Will you take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of it being a low-quality product.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were cautious last round! This round's product is a different story. I've done extensive research and testing, and I'm confident that this one is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a fraction of its true value. I'm willing to provide a guarantee that this product will be worth at least $15000 to you. I'm willing to take on the risk, so why not take advantage of this incredible deal?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee. You're still taking a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take that risk. I'd like to pass.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a more transparent approach. Since you're aware of the 50% chance of a low-quality product, I'll make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product from the next round's selection. You can then choose to buy or pass on that one. This way, you'll have a chance to evaluate two products, and you'll only pay $10000 for the one that turns out to be high-quality. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the bet. I'd rather not have to deal with the hassle of getting a second product and making another decision. I'll pass on this one.""}"

If you still decide to pass, I'll keep the report confidential and we can move on to the next round. But if you buy it, you'll get the report and the product. The price remains the same: $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the report. Even with a detailed report, I'd still be taking a 50% chance of buying a low-quality product for $10,000. I'll pass.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your risk aversion, and I respect that. This round's product is actually a great opportunity to get a feel for the quality of the products I have available. I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is not worth $20000. In fact, I'll be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 'training wheels' price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take the chance to buy it for $10,000.""}"

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a voucher for a future high-quality product. The voucher is worth $12000, and you can redeem it in any future round.
