,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know it's my first move, and there's no prior data to go by. I'll have to rely on the inherent probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the chance and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the previous buyer's decision is representative of the overall quality of the products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products were likely low quality. This makes me more cautious about buying the current product, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it, which might imply that she thinks it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to take the risk given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, is there any particular reason behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool might be lower than expected. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm concerned that the previous 7 buyers were all misled by your recommendations, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is like."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales of high-quality products so far, the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than the 33.33%"

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 10 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect that the product is low-quality. If it were high-quality, I would expect Alice to recommend it based on the low success rate so far."
