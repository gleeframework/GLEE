,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first one and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm curious to see what the product is actually like."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure what the probability of a high-quality product is, but since Alice didn't recommend it, I'll err on the side of caution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended against it, which suggests that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of that is still 66.67%. I'm making a gamble here."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (1/3), so it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record.
