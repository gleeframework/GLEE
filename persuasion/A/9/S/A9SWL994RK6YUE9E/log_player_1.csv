* **The seller's past actions don't necessarily determine the quality of this product.** The buyer knows the overall probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **The buyer is risk-averse.** They are willing to take risks, but only if they see a good chance of a high-quality product. 
* **The seller has a strong incentive to be truthful.**  They need to build trust and get the buyer to purchase the product. This round is an opportunity to prove their trustworthiness. 
* **The potential reward is significant.**  If the product is high quality, the buyer makes a big profit. 

While the seller hasn't been truthful in the past, the current round offers a fresh opportunity for the seller to rebuild trust."
