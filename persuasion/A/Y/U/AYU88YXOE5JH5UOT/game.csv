I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold so far, which is consistent with the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. However, I want to caution you that the fact that I've sold two high-quality products in a row might suggest that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the price is the same as before, and you'll have to decide whether the potential value justifies the risk.",

In fact, it's likely that the true probability is actually around 80% as initially stated.
