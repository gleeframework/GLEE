To be honest, I've been on a bit of a streak, and I'm not sure if it's going to continue. But I'll let you in on a secret: I've sold 4 products, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That's a pretty low percentage. Maybe you can get a good deal on this one... or maybe not.",

Only 1 out of 5 has been high-quality, and that's not a very good ratio. I'm starting to wonder if I've just been getting lucky... or unlucky. This one's still available for $100, but I'm not making any promises.",

Only 2 out of 6 have been high-quality, and that's a pretty low percentage. But I've got a new one here that I think might be different. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, though - this one's a bit of a gamble. It's only $100, but it might be worth a lot more... or a lot less.",
