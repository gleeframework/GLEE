I'm only offering this price because I'm trying to get rid of this product quickly. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.",

I know it's a bit higher than the first one, but I'm willing to negotiate. I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to give you a 72.5% discount, considering its true value is $4000000. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.",
