``` 
The buyer doesn't know the quality of the product and knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. With no sales history, the buyer is unlikely to buy a product. Given this, the only way to get a buyer to buy a product is to recommend the high-quality product.  This is a risky play, as you may convince a buyer to purchase a low-quality product.  However, with no sales history and a low probability of a high-quality product, it is a necessary risk.  The goal is to build a positive sales history."

It is best to continue to only recommend the high-quality products.  Eventually, you will build up a sales history that allows you to recommend both low-quality and high-quality products."
