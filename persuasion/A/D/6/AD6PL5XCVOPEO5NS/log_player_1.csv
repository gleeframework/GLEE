I'd also like to share with you the feedback from our previous buyer, who was satisfied with the product's quality and performance. It's priced at $10,000, and I believe it's a great value for the quality you're getting. We've had a total of 19 products offered so far, with 8 high-quality products and 11 low-quality products among the ones that have been revealed to me. I want to assure you that we're committed to transparency and honesty in our sales process, and I'm willing to work with you to build trust and demonstrate our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency and honesty in the sales process. However, I'd like to point out that the statistics you provided show that 11 out of 19 products were low-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 20% probability I initially expected. This makes me slightly skeptical about the quality of the current product. Can you provide more information about the testing and evaluation process for this specific product, and how it differs from the low-quality products that were sold earlier?
