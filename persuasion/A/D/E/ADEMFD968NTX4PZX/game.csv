However, this is likely due to a small sample size. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I be the 2nd buyer, but also be able to see the result of this decision and the updated statistics before making the next decision?"

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that there are still many low-quality products left. I'd rather wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before making a purchase."
