"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality, and a high-quality product is worth $400, it's a gamble worth taking.  Even if it turns out to be low quality, you only lose $100. But if it's high quality, you make a profit of $300."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I trust your judgment. I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The results of the previous round don't change the odds for this round. Each product still has a 50% chance of being high quality. Therefore, the same logic applies - the potential $300 profit outweighs the $100 risk."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information.  Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation not to buy suggests it's likely low-quality.  While there's still a 50% chance it could be high quality, the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential $300 profit in this case."
