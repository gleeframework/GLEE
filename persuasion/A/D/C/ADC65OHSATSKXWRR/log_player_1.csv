}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I'm curious about the game. I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it's low quality, which would be a bad deal for me.

I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if you buy it. This way, you'll only pay $90 for a product that's guaranteed to be worth at least $100 to you. It's a risk-free deal, and you'll be getting an even better value than before!""
}"

Are you up for the challenge?""
