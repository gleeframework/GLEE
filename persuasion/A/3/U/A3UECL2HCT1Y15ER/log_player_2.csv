"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** We have no information about the specific product's quality except for Alice's recommendation.
* **High expected value:**  Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the expected value of buying is still positive: 
    * (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000 
    * This is equal to the cost of the product, meaning on average, we expect to break even. 

**Strategy:** In the early rounds, it makes sense to take some risks since we have no information to go on. We can use the information gained from these early rounds to refine our strategy later."

* **Positive reinforcement:** Alice's recommendation was correct in the previous round, increasing our confidence in her judgment. 
* **Expected value:**  The expected value of buying is still positive, as in the previous round.
* **No reason to deviate:** We still have no information about the current product's quality beyond Alice's recommendation.

**Strategy:**  Continue to trust Alice's recommendations in the early rounds. We are building a foundation of data to potentially adjust our strategy later."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Breaking the pattern:**  Alice has been consistently recommending purchases, which have all been high-quality. This sudden shift in her behavior is significant.
* **Potential information:** Alice's reason for not recommending could provide valuable insights into the product's quality, even if she's wrong.
