low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, and if it's high-quality, I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the statistics of the previous buyer who bought the product, was it high or low quality?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product based solely on your recommendation, especially since there's no information on the quality of the previous product sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer didn't buy, so I'll give it a shot."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, considering the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the product. The lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been of high quality, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the previous buyers were also recommended to buy low-quality products, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that the product may also be low quality and not worth $100 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. Given the seller's overall probability of 80% for high-quality products, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been offered products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless item."
