,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I've only seen 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product and the statistics, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended were low quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality as well. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about your thought process behind it. Are you using Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the statistics. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and the accuracy of Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, this is not surprising. However, considering the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and no high-quality product has been sold yet, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more data to become available."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 7th buyer. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
