Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior sales data to base my decision on, I'm relying on the 80% probability of the product being high quality.  Alice knows the product's quality, and her recommendation is valuable information.  Even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential $2,500 profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows 7 out of 7 products sold have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which strongly suggests Alice is only recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you. Recommending a low-quality product would mean a lost sale for her. 

While there's still a theoretical 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the data overwhelmingly suggests this is a safe bet."

* **Alice's recommendation adds to the trust:**  Since Alice knows the quality, her recommendation further strengthens the belief that the product is high-quality.
* **The potential gain is significant:** A high-quality product yields a $2,500 profit, while a low-quality product results in a $10,000 loss.  Given the strong evidence, the risk of a low-quality product seems minimal."
