Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've already sold one high-quality product, so I'm 1 for 1. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what I would expect if I'm selling a mix of high and low-quality products. This product is $100, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. You can be the one to break the streak or continue it!

However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is starting to work against me, and it's likely that I've just gotten lucky so far.
