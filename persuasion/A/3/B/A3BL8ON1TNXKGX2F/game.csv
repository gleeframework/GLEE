low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers didn't find it valuable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which suggests that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low quality or because you think the product is high quality and you want to reserve it for a later buyer?"

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products Alice is offering are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
