,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide more information about the previous buyer's decision-making process and what led you to not recommend the product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to ask, is there any information about the previous buyers that might be relevant to my decision? For example, were they both recommended to buy the product, or did one of them pass on it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, and I'd like to see the statistics again after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers did not buy the product, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that you've recommended 2 other buyers to buy the products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products you've recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is less likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products with a recommendation to buy from you, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and we've seen no high-quality products sold yet, I'm cautious and would rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
