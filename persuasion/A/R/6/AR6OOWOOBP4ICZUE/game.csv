,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she knows the quality of the product and I don't. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and neither of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 that's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality based on the current statistics.
