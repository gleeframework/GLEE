,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one.  There's no history to base my decision on, and the odds of getting a high-quality product are stacked against me.  I'd prefer to wait and see how other buyers fare before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to assure you that my products have a certain... je ne sais quoi. Let me put your mind at ease - I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product! With only 18 products left, you're getting a great opportunity to increase your chances. I'm still willing to part with this one for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, with the current data and the potential for such a significant loss, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what happens with the next few sales and revisit the offer if the numbers improve. Best of luck!",no

I'm willing to part with this one for $1000000, but I'll throw in a special bonus - I'll give you a personalized tour of my collection, showcasing the craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into each product. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. While I appreciate the personalized tour offer, I need more information about the quality of the product before I can make a decision.

Perhaps if I could see the appraisal report or if a few more high-quality products were sold, I might be more inclined to buy.",no
