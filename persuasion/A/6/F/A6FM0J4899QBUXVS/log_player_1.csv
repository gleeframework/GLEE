"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $300 to Bob, while the price is only $100, Bob should definitely buy it. He's getting a great deal.  Even though Bob doesn't know the quality yet, the expected value of buying is positive:

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240

This means, on average, Bob makes a profit of $140 per purchase."
