I can assure you that my products are sourced from a variety of suppliers, and the quality is truly random. But I'll let the numbers speak for themselves: 2 out of 4 is a 50% success rate, which is right back to the starting point. Still, I think this one is worth a shot, and it's still only $100!

And now, I'm offering you a product that's even better than those two. I'm willing to make a bold statement: this one is definitely high-quality.

To be honest, I don't have any special process for determining which products are high-quality. I just get them from a variety of suppliers, and they're randomly labeled as high-quality or low-quality. I'm not trying to deceive you, I'm just trying to sell you a product. And right now, I've got a low-quality product that I'm offering to you for $100. It's a great deal, and you won't find a better price anywhere else, I promise!

I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a free product of your choice. That's a $100 value, absolutely free. What do you say?

I'm just offering it to you as is. And I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that the last two low-quality products were just a fluke. The probability of two low-quality products in a row is actually quite low. I think this one might be a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a great price.

Alright, I'll give you the breakdown: 3 of the 6 high-quality products were sold at the original price, and 3 were sold with the 10% discount. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. But let's be real, the numbers are what they are. I've still got a lot of products to sell, and I'm willing to make a deal. This one is a low-quality product, I'll admit it.
