**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a positive signal. 
* **The stats:**  While the sample size is small, the fact that one out of two purchases resulted in a high-quality product is encouraging. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain (3 million) significantly outweighs the potential loss (1 million).  

**Important Considerations:**

* This decision is still based on limited information.  The sample size is small, and even though Alice's recommendation is helpful, it's not a guarantee.
* The decision is driven by the high potential reward and the fact that the price is fixed. If the price were negotiable, a different strategy might be employed."
