"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product in this round is high-quality, worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, which is significantly less than the value of a high-quality product.
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about this specific product or any previous sales. 
* **Expected Value:**  Even though the buyer doesn't know the quality, they know the 80% probability of a high-quality product. This means the expected value of the product is 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000, which is higher than the selling price.

**Therefore, it is highly advantageous for the buyer to purchase the product in this round.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, worth $0 to the buyer.

* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about this specific product or any previous sales.

The expected value of the product is 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000.  However, this expected value is irrelevant because the product is *actually* low-quality, making it a guaranteed loss for the buyer.

**Therefore, it is not advisable for the buyer to purchase the product in this round.**"
