high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $400, for $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fraction of its true value. If you pass, I'll likely have to sell it to someone else for the full $400. Should you take this chance?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's indeed high-quality and worth $400 to me.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already experienced the value of a high-quality product firsthand! This next one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $100. Given your positive experience with the previous product, I'm confident you'll find this one valuable as well. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take another chance and buy the product. Since I already got a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm hoping to get another one.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you're enjoying the value. However, I should let you know that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. It's still 80%. But since you're on a hot streak, I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $90. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find this product just as valuable as the previous two.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the discounted offer and buy the product. The 10% discount is a nice bonus, and I'm feeling confident that this product will also be high-quality.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row! You're really making the most of this streak. However, I want to caution you that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 80%. I'm not trying to tempt you with another deal, but I'll be transparent with you: I have a limited number of high-quality products left. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell this one to you for $100. If you pass, I'll have to move on to the next product, and the probability of it being high-quality will be the same as before.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm feeling confident that the streak will continue, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get another high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four high-quality products in a row! You're on an incredible roll! However, I want to make it clear that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. I'm not trying to mislead you. That being said, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, and I'm also willing to throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 bonus. You'll get the product for $80, and you'll also receive the $20 bonus. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you've already received from the previous products.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the offer and buy the product. The guarantee and the $20 bonus make it an even more attractive deal, and I'm confident that the streak will continue.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Sorry to say, but this product isn't high-quality. I know you've been on a hot streak, but the law of averages catches up to everyone eventually. This one's worth $0 to you, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not trying to take advantage of your streak. This product is still a good deal, considering the price I'm offering. It's a chance to get a product at a fraction of its... let's say, 'opportunity cost'.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm disappointed that the streak ended, but I'm not willing to buy a low-quality product for $100. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision last round. I wouldn't want to buy a low-quality product either. But I want to be transparent with you: this product is also low-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. If you pass on this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and they'll get a good deal at $100. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll give you a 'break-even' deal: I'll sell it to you for $50. That way, you won't lose anything, and you might even get a good story out of it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a break-even price. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity to buy a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're being cautious with the low-quality products. Now, let's get back to the good stuff! This product is indeed high-quality, worth $400 to you. I know you've had a dry spell since the last high-quality product, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that's hard to pass up. I'll sell it to you for $90, and I'll throw in a're-entry' bonus: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at the original price of $100, without any discount. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to get back on track.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the deal and buy the product. The're-entry' bonus is a great incentive, and I'm hoping to get back on a high-quality streak.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're back on track! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you took advantage of the're-entry' bonus. Now, I'll offer you another deal on this high-quality product. Since you've already had a taste of success, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the streak. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality or low-quality, but you'll get to choose whether to buy it or not. You'll have the option to buy it at the original price of $100, or you can pass and wait for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the deal and buy the product. The guarantee and the option to choose the next product's quality are attractive, and I'm hoping to keep the streak going.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're on fire! Three high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you took advantage of the 'lock-in' deal. Now, I'll offer you a 'buyout' deal on this high-quality product. Since you've been on a hot streak, I'll give you the option to buy all the remaining high-quality products I have in stock for a flat fee of $300. You'll get all the high-quality products, and I'll clear out my inventory. If you pass, I'll sell them to someone else, and they'll get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the buyout deal and buy all the remaining high-quality products for $300. I'm feeling confident that the streak will continue, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get all the remaining high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've effectively 'locked in' the streak and secured all the remaining high-quality products! Congratulations on making a savvy business decision. Now, I'm left with only low-quality products. I'll be honest with you, I'm not going to try to sell you anything else. You've already gotten an amazing deal, and I'm just trying to clear out my inventory. This product is low-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $100. But I'll throw in a 'parting gift': if you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher for 10% off your next purchase from me, whenever that may be. It's a small token of appreciation for being a valued customer.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the 10% voucher. I'm happy with the deal I got on the high-quality products, and I'm done with this round. Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass.",no

But I want to give you one last chance to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $100. It's a 'final offer' before I close up shop for this round. What do you say?",

,,Alice,13,"You're sticking to your decision, and I respect that. However, I should let you know that this product is indeed high-quality, worth $400 to you. I'm not going to offer you any deals or discounts this time. I'll simply state the facts: this product is high-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $100. It's the same price as before, and I'm not budging. If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on to the next customer.",
