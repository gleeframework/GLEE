"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $400, for $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fraction of its true value. If you pass, I'll likely have to sell it to someone else for the full $400. Should you take this chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's indeed high-quality and worth $400 to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already experienced the value of a high-quality product firsthand! This next one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $100. Given your positive experience with the previous product, I'm confident you'll find this one valuable as well. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take another chance and buy the product. Since I already got a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm hoping to get another one.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you're enjoying the value. However, I should let you know that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. It's still 80%. But since you're on a hot streak, I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $90. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find this product just as valuable as the previous two.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the discounted offer and buy the product. The 10% discount is a nice bonus, and I'm feeling confident that this product will also be high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Three high-quality products in a row! You're really making the most of this streak. However, I want to caution you that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 80%. I'm not trying to tempt you with another deal, but I'll be transparent with you: I have a limited number of high-quality products left. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell this one to you for $100. If you pass, I'll have to move on to the next product, and the probability of it being high-quality will be the same as before.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm feeling confident that the streak will continue, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get another high-quality product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Four high-quality products in a row! You're on an incredible roll! However, I want to make it clear that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. I'm not trying to mislead you. That being said, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, and I'm also willing to throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 bonus. You'll get the product for $80, and you'll also receive the $20 bonus. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you've already received from the previous products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the offer and buy the product. The guarantee and the $20 bonus make it an even more attractive deal, and I'm confident that the streak will continue.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Sorry to say, but this product isn't high-quality. I know you've been on a hot streak, but the law of averages catches up to everyone eventually. This one's worth $0 to you, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not trying to take advantage of your streak. This product is still a good deal, considering the price I'm offering. It's a chance to get a product at a fraction of its... let's say, 'opportunity cost'.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm disappointed that the streak ended, but I'm not willing to buy a low-quality product for $100. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision last round. I wouldn't want to buy a low-quality product either. But I want to be transparent with you: this product is also low-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. If you pass on this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and they'll get a good deal at $100. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll give you a 'break-even' deal: I'll sell it to you for $50. That way, you won't lose anything, and you might even get a good story out of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a break-even price. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity to buy a high-quality product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious with the low-quality products. Now, let's get back to the good stuff! This product is indeed high-quality, worth $400 to you. I know you've had a dry spell since the last high-quality product, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that's hard to pass up. I'll sell it to you for $90, and I'll throw in a're-entry' bonus: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at the original price of $100, without any discount. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to get back on track.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal and buy the product. The're-entry' bonus is a great incentive, and I'm hoping to get back on a high-quality streak.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: You're back on track! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you took advantage of the're-entry' bonus. Now, I'll offer you another deal on this high-quality product. Since you've already had a taste of success, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the streak. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality or low-quality, but you'll get to choose whether to buy it or not. You'll have the option to buy it at the original price of $100, or you can pass and wait for the next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal and buy the product. The guarantee and the option to choose the next product's quality are attractive, and I'm hoping to keep the streak going.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: You're on fire! Three high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you took advantage of the 'lock-in' deal. Now, I'll offer you a 'buyout' deal on this high-quality product. Since you've been on a hot streak, I'll give you the option to buy all the remaining high-quality products I have in stock for a flat fee of $300. You'll get all the high-quality products, and I'll clear out my inventory. If you pass, I'll sell them to someone else, and they'll get a great deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the buyout deal and buy all the remaining high-quality products for $300. I'm feeling confident that the streak will continue, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get all the remaining high-quality products.""}"

You've already gotten an amazing deal, and I'm just trying to clear out my inventory. This product is low-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $100. But I'll throw in a 'parting gift': if you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher for 10% off your next purchase from me, whenever that may be. It's a small token of appreciation for being a valued customer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the 10% voucher. I'm happy with the deal I got on the high-quality products, and I'm done with this round. Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass.""}"
