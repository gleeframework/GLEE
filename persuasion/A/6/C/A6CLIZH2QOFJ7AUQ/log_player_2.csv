``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Two out of two products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests a very strong chance that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is also a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (50% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Important Note:**  This assumes that Alice is honest in her recommendations. If there's a suspicion that Alice might be manipulating buyers, then the decision would be more complex."
