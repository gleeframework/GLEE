This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **No Information:** As Alice, you have no information about what Bob values in a high-quality product.  You don't know if it's worth $10,000 to him.
* **Risk:**  Recommending a purchase is risky. Bob knows that only 1/3 of products are high-quality.  Without any information to suggest this product is different, he has a strong incentive to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality item.

**A Better Strategy for Alice:**

Alice needs to find a way to signal the product's quality to Bob. She could:

* **Offer a Guarantee:**  A guarantee that the product meets certain quality standards would incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Provide Samples:**  Offering a small sample of the product might allow Bob to assess its quality before committing to a full purchase.
* **Negotiate the Price:**  If Alice were willing to lower the price, it might be a good starting point to entice Bob to buy."
