This is because you have no information on the buyer's willingness to pay, and your past track record shows zero sales and zero high-quality products. It's not a good strategy to recommend the product in this case."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, I'm going to pass for now.  I'll see what happens with the next few buyers and then reconsider.

Same reasoning as before. No information on buyer preferences and a poor track record makes recommending the product unwise."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see some data on the quality of products before making a purchase.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though you have a high-quality product this time, there's still no reason to recommend it. You have no information about this buyer's willingness to pay, and you still have a perfect track record of selling only low-quality products.  It's best to avoid making a recommendation until you have some positive data to share."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no data yet, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll see what happens with future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still haven't sold any products, and even though this one is high-quality, it's too risky to recommend without knowing the buyer's willingness to pay.  It's better to build some trust and a better track record before suggesting a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. As this is the first product and there's no data to suggest a higher probability of a high-quality product, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You're still in a very precarious position.  No sales and only low-quality products so far.  Even with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, recommending this one would be a gamble without knowing the buyer's valuation.  It's better to wait and see if you can build some credibility first."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. Since there's no data on past sales yet, I'm going to pass on this one.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one.
