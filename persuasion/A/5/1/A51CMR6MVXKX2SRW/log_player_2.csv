"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While there is a risk that the product is low quality, the recommendation from Alice adds some valuable information.  Since we don't know her strategy, we should assume she is trying to help us get a good deal. Since the potential value of a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0), it's worth taking the risk in this first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation. I'm feeling lucky!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice recommended the product in the first round and it turned out to be high quality, it's reasonable to assume her recommendations are valuable.  We have no reason to believe her strategy has changed, so it's worth taking the risk again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Hmm, you didn't recommend this one. I'm going to pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information.  Since she recommended the previous two products, and they were both high quality, her silence here is significant.  It suggests she believes the product is likely low quality, which makes it a risky purchase.  Passing allows us to avoid the potential loss and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alright, I'll trust your judgment again. Let's give it a shot.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation was wrong in the last round, it's still valuable information. It's possible that the product was simply a rare case of a low-quality item, and Alice's recommendation could still be reliable overall. We should weigh the potential gain ($40,000) against the potential loss ($0), and continue to trust her judgment for now."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is mixed, but she's shown a strong ability to identify high-quality products. Her silence in this round is a significant indicator that the product is likely low-quality.  It's safer to pass and avoid the potential loss than to risk buying a product she doesn't recommend."
