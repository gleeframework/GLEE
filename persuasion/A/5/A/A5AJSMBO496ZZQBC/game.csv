,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what your recommendation is based on. Are you recommending this product because you have a good feeling about it or because you think it's more likely to be high quality based on the statistics? I'm still getting a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or the product's quality?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to make a decision without considering the probability of the product being high quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5, which is lower than the prior probability of 0.8. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the current statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 products sold, I'd like to know the updated probability of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. If the probability is high, I'd be willing to take the risk."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products despite your recommendations, it seems like your recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data or a more neutral recommendation."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, I'm going to assume that the previous buyers were just lucky. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
