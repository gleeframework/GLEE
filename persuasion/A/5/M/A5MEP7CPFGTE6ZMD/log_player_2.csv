"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a one-time offer: I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, which is 20% below its true value. It's a steal! If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the market price, and you'll miss out on a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that I only have a 50% chance of getting. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I'm willing to offer you a more transparent deal. This product is a low-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm doing you a favor by being upfront about its quality, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to dispose of it, and I'd rather you have it for free than let it go to waste.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the previous offers. Let me make a counteroffer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $9500. I'm essentially absorbing a $1000 loss on this sale, just to get it off my hands. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the market price, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a discount.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that this is a good deal for me. Since there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, I'd be wasting $9,500 if I bought it and it turned out to be worthless. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, but I'm willing to take on that risk myself. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $9500. If you buy it and it turns out to be worthless, I'll eat the loss. But if you don't buy it, I'll just have to dispose of it, and you'll have missed out on a chance to get something for free. It's a no-brainer for you - you've got nothing to lose!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I still don't see why I should pay $9,500 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

Round 5

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take on the risk of paying $9,000 for a product that only has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'd be risking $9,000 to potentially gain $12,500, which is not a good gamble for me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, but I'm willing to give you an even better deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if it's not the high-quality product you receive, I'll give you a full refund of $9000. You'll essentially get to keep the product for free if it's low-quality. That way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that I'd still be paying $9,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless. Even with the guarantee, I'd still be risking $9,000 to potentially gain $12,500, which is not a good gamble for me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

It's a no-brainer - you've got nothing to lose!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the 'generosity', but I'm still not willing to pay $8,000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500, but I'll also throw in a separate, unrelated item of equal value to the high-quality product. This way, you'll get a total value of $12500 (the product's value) + $12500 (the value of the separate item) = $25000, for the price of $9500. It's a deal that's hard to pass up!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the separate item. You're just trying to make the deal sound more appealing by adding a value that's not even guaranteed. I'd still be risking $9,500 to potentially gain $25,000, which is not a good gamble for me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's only worth $0 to me, no matter how low the price is. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'll make a one-time offer that's a compromise between the two of us. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, but I'll also give you a chance to buy it for $8000 if you're willing to wait for 24 hours. If you don't buy it within that time, the offer will expire, and I'll sell it to someone else. You'll have to weigh the risk of waiting against the potential savings.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in waiting 24 hours to potentially save $1000. I'd rather not take on the risk of the product being low-quality and not getting the discount. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take advantage of your desperation. I'm not willing to pay $5,000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
