,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't have any information about the seller's past sales record. I'd like to pass on this opportunity to the next buyer."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk since I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm willing to take the risk. I've seen that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so I'm thinking that the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm willing to take the chance for a potential $20000 gain."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that this might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing $10000 on it. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendations improve as more buyers come in."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I think there's a high chance that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that the previous 4 buyers didn't seem to know what they were doing and didn't take advantage of the low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they bought were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical about the current product, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is of low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 buyers having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the 6th buyer. I'd like to buy it and see if it's high-quality or low-quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,
