high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also considering the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the product's quality before I make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product based on your previous recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record, which suggests that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the 2nd buyer, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's too early to make a decision. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and why you don't recommend this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, which is consistent with the prior probability of 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your recommendation and the current sales record. The fact that none of the previous products sold were high-quality makes me think it's likely that the product I'll get is also low-quality."

,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather not risk buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when I can potentially get a high-quality product later."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me a strong reason to buy."
