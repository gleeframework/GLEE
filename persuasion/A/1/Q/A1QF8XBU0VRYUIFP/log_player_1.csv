"The buyer's message: I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll also think about the statistics.

However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll still take a cautious approach and think about the expected value. If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $3000000, but if it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. The expected value is (0.5 * $3000000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1500000. Since the expected value is less than the price of $1000000, I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'll take the product!
