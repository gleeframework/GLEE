,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll also consider the probability of the product being high-quality. With 3 high-quality products out of 7 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is 42.86%. I'll take a chance and buy the product."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to think about it, considering the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the recommendation is not 100% convincing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll also think about the statistics. With 4 out of 8 products being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/8 = 0.5. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll still take a cautious approach and think about the expected value. If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $3000000, but if it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. The expected value is (0.5 * $3000000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1500000. Since the expected value is less than the price of $1000000, I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'll take the product!"

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 4 high-quality products out of 10 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 40%. I'll take a calculated risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
