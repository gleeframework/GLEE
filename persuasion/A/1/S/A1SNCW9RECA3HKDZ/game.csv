I've already sold one product, and I'm proud to say it was a high-quality one. I'm not sure what you think this one is worth, but I'm confident it's a great opportunity. I've got a 33.33% chance of selling you a high-quality product, which is a pretty good odds, if I do say so myself. What do you think?",
