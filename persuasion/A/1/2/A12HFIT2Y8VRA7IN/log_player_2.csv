Alice's message: Hello! This is a great product that I think you'll really love. I've just started selling, so I don't have any previous sales to reference, but I assure you that I stand behind the quality of what I'm offering. It's a fantastic deal for $10000!

I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that's worth $12,000 to me.""

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what's causing this streak of low-quality products. I've been trying to identify the issue, but so far, I haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. I can tell you that I've been working with the same suppliers and following the same processes, but somehow, the quality just hasn't been meeting my expectations. As for the current product, I don't want to sugarcoat it - it's just another product in the same batch as the previous ones. I wouldn't say there's anything particularly special about it that would make it more likely to be high-quality. If you're still willing to take a chance, I'll be upfront with you - the odds are probably against you.
