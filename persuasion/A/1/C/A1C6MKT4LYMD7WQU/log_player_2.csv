**Reasoning:**

The buyer is presented with the following information:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information, as Alice knows the actual quality of the product.
* **Past sales data:** 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This implies a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.

Given this information, it makes sense to take the risk and purchase the product. The potential reward (getting a high-quality product worth $125) outweighs the potential risk (getting a low-quality product worth $0)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** With 100% of the recommended products being high quality, Alice's recommendations are a strong indicator of product quality. 
* **Risk vs Reward:** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **Limited Information:**  We don't know the total number of products sold, so we can't be certain if Alice is cherry-picking the best products for recommendations. However, the data available suggests a high likelihood of a positive outcome."

**Explanation:**

Since 5 out of 5 products sold have been high quality, this means Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.  This strong track record makes the recommendation very valuable.  While there's still a chance the current product is low quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality based on Alice's past performance. Therefore, it's a good decision to buy."
