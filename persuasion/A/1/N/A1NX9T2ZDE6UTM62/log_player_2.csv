**Explanation:**

* **The evidence is strong:** With 9 high-quality products out of 9 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is incredibly high. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is not foolproof, it strengthens the case for buying. She has access to information we don't, which makes her recommendation valuable.
* **The potential reward:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of $3,000,000 far outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes a rational and risk-tolerant buyer. A very risk-averse buyer might still choose to pass, but the information available heavily favors purchasing the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 10 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 11th buyer!
