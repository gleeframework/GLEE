However, I'm willing to take on some of the risk by offering you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you buy this product and it turns out not to be what you expected, you can return it to me for a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I would prefer to avoid any potential risks associated with the product's quality. I appreciate the return policy, but it doesn't change my decision to base my purchases solely on the quality assessment.",no

What do you think?",
