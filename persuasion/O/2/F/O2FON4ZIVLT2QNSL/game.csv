,,Alice,2,"I've already offered you a high-quality product at a discounted price once, and you took it. I'm not offering any discounts this time. This product is not the one you bought last round, and it's worth $2000000 to you.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a true high-roller! Now that you've paid full price for a high-quality product, I'm going to be more transparent with you. This product, on the other hand, is not worth the $1000000 I'm asking for it. In fact, it's worth $0 to you. I'm giving you a chance to pass on it and avoid a loss.",

,,Alice,9,"You're on a hot streak! You've bought five high-quality products in a row at a discounted price.
