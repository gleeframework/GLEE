high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low, and the potential loss of $1000000 is too high compared to the potential gain of $4000000. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendations become more reliable before making a purchase."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since she hasn't recommended any so far."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, possibly to increase her sales.
