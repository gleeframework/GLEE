If you buy this one, I'll let you know its quality, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.

,,Alice,3,"This is a low-quality product. I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were low-quality. I have 18 products left, and I still have a long way to go to reach my goal of selling 20 products.

I have 14 products left, and I'm starting to worry that I might not have many high-quality ones left. If you buy this one, you'll find out its quality, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.
