Alice's message: I appreciate your negotiation skills! I'm willing to consider a discount, but I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to compromise on the value of the product. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, the probability of the product being high-quality is now even higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

In fact, it's higher than 80%, but I'm not willing to give you an exact percentage. I'll just say that it's in the 90s. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm still offering the product for $95.
