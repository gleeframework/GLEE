Given the high stakes ($1,000,000 price for a potential $1,200,000 value or $0 value), I'll pass on this round to avoid the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've missed out on two high-quality products so far, but that doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality, which remains 50%. Alice's recommendation is still uninformative, and I have no reason to believe that her recommendation is correlated with the product's quality. Given the high stakes, I'll continue to err on the side of caution and pass on this round.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""At this point, it's clear that Alice is recommending every product, regardless of its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Finally, a low-quality product appears, which confirms my suspicion that Alice's recommendations are uninformative.

Alice's recommendations have been shown to be uninformative, and I have no reason to believe that this recommendation is any different. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value of buying the product is still $600,000 ($1,200,000 x 0.5 + $0 x 0.5), which is less than the price of $1,000,000.
