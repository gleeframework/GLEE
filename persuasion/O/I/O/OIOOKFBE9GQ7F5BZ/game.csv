high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, which show 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than expected. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high quality is low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is more than its worth to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, have not purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal or wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk and hope it's high-quality."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
