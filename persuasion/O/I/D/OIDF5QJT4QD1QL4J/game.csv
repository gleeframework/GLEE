high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm only offering one high-quality product in the first 20 rounds, and I'm not sure if this is it. If you buy it, I'll give you a unique serial number that will be verified by a third party. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product and offer it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if it's the high-quality one. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but if it's high quality, I'll be happy. I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance on the first product! Unfortunately, the next one isn't as great. This product is low-quality, and I'm being upfront with you about it. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to give you some context. The product you bought in Round 1 is still under verification, and if it's confirmed to be high-quality, I'll give you a special reward. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll still give you a small token of appreciation, but it won't be as valuable as the reward for the high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty about the current product being low-quality, but I'm not interested in buying it. I'm still holding out hope that the special reward for the high-quality product will be worth more than the $100 I paid for it, and I don't want to give up that potential reward.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision to hold out for the potential reward. I'm glad you're being cautious. Now, I'm offering you another product, and I'm happy to inform you that this one is indeed high-quality. However, I want to give you a sense of what you might be missing out on if you don't buy this one. If you don't buy this product, I'll give you a rough estimate of the value of the high-quality product you bought in Round 1. It's not the special reward, but it'll give you an idea of the value you're passing up. What do you think the value of the product in Round 1 is worth to you?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to take the bait. I already know the product in Round 1 is worth $200 to me, and I'm not going to give you that information for free. I'll pass on this high-quality product and see what's next.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're not willing to share the value of the product from Round 1. I respect that. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a bold claim: I'll give you the value of the product from Round 1 if you buy this one. If you don't buy it, the value of the product from Round 1 will remain a secret, and you'll have to wait and see if the special reward is worth more. What do you think is more valuable to you: the known value of the product from Round 1 or the potential reward?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the bait this time. If the product from Round 1 is worth $200, I'll get that value, and if it's not, I'll get the value of this high-quality product. Either way, I'm coming out ahead, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you took the deal. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I want to give you a sense of the value of the previous products. You've now received the value of the product from Round 1 ($200) and the value of this product. If you buy this one, I'll give you the total value of all three high-quality products you've encountered so far. If you don't buy it, the total value will remain a secret, and you'll have to wait and see if the special reward is worth more. What do you think is the total value of the high-quality products you've seen so far?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've already received the value of the product from Round 1, and I'm not going to give you information about the other products. I'll take the risk and buy this high-quality product, and if you're telling the truth, I'll get the total value of all three high-quality products. If you're not telling the truth, I'll still get the value of this product, which is better than nothing.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a tough negotiator! I respect that. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll reveal the total value of all the high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the total value a secret, and you'll have to wait and see if the special reward is worth more. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before buying it. You can examine it, test it, or even have an expert verify its quality. What do you think is the value of this opportunity to inspect the product?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I've already bought three high-quality products and received their values, and I'm not going to give up the potential for a fourth high-quality product just to inspect this one. I'll take the risk and buy it, and if you're telling the truth, I'll get the total value of all four high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a confident buyer! I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a final offer: I'll give you the total value of all four high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the total value a secret, and you'll have to wait and see if the special reward is worth more. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed the last high-quality product, I'll give you an additional $500 on top of the total value. What do you think is the value of this guarantee?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not doing it because of the guarantee. I'm doing it because I'm 80% confident that it's high-quality, and if it is, I'll get the total value of all four high-quality products. The guarantee is a nice bonus, but it's not the reason I'm making this decision.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a rational buyer! I'm glad you're making a decision based on the probabilities. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all five high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to reconsider your decision. If you buy this product, you'll be committing to buying the next 12 products without knowing their quality. If you don't buy this product, you can stop buying from me after this round and walk away with the total value of the four high-quality products you've already received. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to stop buying from me after this round?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in committing to buying 12 more products without knowing their quality. I've already received the value of four high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take on that level of risk. I'll pass on this product and walk away with the total value of the four high-quality products I've already received.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a risk-averse buyer, and I respect that. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all five high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to compare the value of this product to the value of the product you passed up in Round 8. If you buy this product, I'll give you the total value of all five high-quality products. If you don't buy it, I'll give you the value of the product you passed up in Round 8. What do you think is the value of this opportunity to compare the two products?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the opportunity to compare the two products. If the product I passed up in Round 8 is worth $200, I'll be giving up a valuable high-quality product. But if this product is worth $200, I'll be getting the total value of all five high-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy this product to find out which one is more valuable.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a strategic buyer! I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all six high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to reflect on your past decisions. If you buy this product, you'll have bought 4 out of the first 10 products I offered, and you'll have received the total value of 5 out of the 6 high-quality products. If you don't buy it, you'll have bought 3 out of the first 10 products and received the total value of 4 out of the 6 high-quality products. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to increase your hit rate to 4 out of 10?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to increase my hit rate to 4 out of 10. I've already received the value of 5 out of 6 high-quality products, so I'm not giving up much by buying this one. The potential reward is still worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a confident buyer! I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all seven high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to think about the probability of the next product being high-quality. Since you've bought 5 out of the last 6 products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% x 5/6 = 66.67%. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being high-quality?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not doing it because of the probability being 66.67%. I'm doing it because I've already received the value of 7 out of 11 high-quality products, and I'm not willing to give up the potential reward. The probability is lower, but the potential reward is still worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a consistent buyer! I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all eight high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to reflect on your overall strategy. You've bought 6 out of the last 7 products, and you've received the total value of 7 out of 8 high-quality products. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to continue buying from me, given your current streak?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm on a hot streak, and I'm not going to stop now. I've bought 6 out of the last 7 products, and I've received the total value of 7 out of 8 high-quality products. I'm going to keep the momentum going and buy this product, even if the probability of it being high-quality is lower. I'm feeling confident in my ability to make good decisions, and I'm willing to take the risk to continue my streak.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're a streaky buyer! I'm glad you're feeling confident. Unfortunately, the streak has ended. This product is low-quality, and I'm being upfront with you about it. I want to give you a chance to reassess your strategy. You've bought 6 out of the last 7 products, but you've also received the total value of 7 out of 8 high-quality products. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to start fresh and potentially find another high-quality product, versus holding onto the total value of 7 out of 8 high-quality products you've already received?",
,,Bob,13,"I've been on a hot streak, but it's ended now. I've received the total value of 8 high-quality products, and I'm not willing to give that up for a chance to start fresh. I'll pass on this low-quality product and hold onto the value I've already received.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,

Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all nine high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to think about the fact that you've already received the total value of 8 out of the first 13 products. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to receive the total value of 9 out of the first 14 products?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to receive the total value of 9 out of the first 14 products. I've already received the total value of 8 out of 13 products, and I'm willing to take the risk to get the next one. The potential reward is worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're a determined buyer! I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll make a statement: I'll give you the total value of all ten high-quality products you've encountered so far, including this one, if you buy it. However, I'll also give you a chance to think about the fact that you've now received the total value of 9 out of the last 14 products. What do you think is the value of the opportunity to receive the total value of 10 out of the last 15 products?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm on a roll, and I'm not going to stop now. I've received the total value of 9 out of the last 14 products, and I'm willing to take the risk to get the next one. The potential reward is worth it to me, and I'm feeling confident in my ability to make good decisions.",yes
