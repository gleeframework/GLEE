Alice's message: I see you're a sharp observer! You're right, the initial probability of a product being high-quality was indeed 33.33%. However, I'd like to clarify that the probability I mentioned earlier was based on the specific sample of products I've sold so far. Since I've sold 3 products in total, with 2 of them being low-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 1/3, not 1/2. I'm offering you this next product for $100, and I'm confident it's a great value.

However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me, if it's high-quality.

Alice's message: I'm impressed by your analytical skills! You're right, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 1/9 or approximately 11.11%. I'm glad you're thinking critically about the situation. As for the products sold before the 9 I mentioned, I can tell you that the first 2 products I sold were indeed low-quality. The first one was the one you bought in Round 1, and the second one was the one you passed on in Round 2. After that, I had a streak of 3 high-quality products in a row, which is why the overall probability of a product being high-quality seemed to be higher. But it seems like I've reverted back to my average performance. I'm offering you this next product for $100, and I'll give you a 25% discount if you buy it. That brings the price down to $75.
