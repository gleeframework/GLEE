,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. If you buy it, you'll get it for $100, but there's a 50% chance it's a high-quality product. If you don't buy it, I'll offer the next product, and you can make a decision based on the updated information. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the risk and buy the product for $100. I'm excited to see if it's high-quality or low-quality!,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I'm glad the first one was a success! Now, I'll give you a bit of information to help you make a decision. You know that the first product was low-quality, and you also know that I've sold 1 product so far, 0 of which were high-quality. This means that the probability of the second product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll give you a hint: if I had a high-quality product in stock, I would have sold it to the first buyer. Since I didn't, it's possible that I have a higher proportion of low-quality products in my inventory. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your hint. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that! I'll give you an update on my sales record: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll also give you a bit of transparency: I have 19 products left in stock, and I'm eager to sell them. If you're willing to take the risk, you can get this product for $100. If you don't, I'll have to keep trying to sell the remaining 18 products, and you might miss out on a potential high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You got lucky! Congratulations on buying a high-quality product! I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% as well. However, I'll give you a new piece of information: I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, which is a higher proportion of high-quality products than I initially expected. This might suggest that I have a higher proportion of high-quality products in my inventory than I initially thought. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product for $100, considering the higher proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're right to consider the updated information! I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 being high-quality. However, this latest product is low-quality, which means that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3, and 2 low-quality products out of 3. This is actually a lower proportion of high-quality products than I initially expected. I'll give you a new hint: I have 16 products left in stock, and I'm eager to sell them. If you're willing to take the risk, you can get this product for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm trying to be transparent about my sales record.",

My sales record is now 2/4 high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. However, I'll give you a new piece of information: I've sold 4 out of 7 products so far, which means I have 3 products left in stock. I'll make a bold claim: I'm willing to give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If you buy it, and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. Would you like to take the risk and buy the product for $100, with the guarantee?",

However, I'll give you a new piece of information: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which is a 37.5% success rate. This is lower than the initial 50% probability, which might suggest that I have a higher proportion of low-quality products in my inventory than I initially thought. On the other hand, I've also sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is a streak of good luck. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the risk and buy the product for $100, considering the lower success rate and the streak of good luck. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also prepared to walk away if it's low-quality.",yes
