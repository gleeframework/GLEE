,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data on the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a sense of the product's quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to be the first buyer to purchase a product based on Alice's recommendation, as it might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will purchase it and get a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing given the 20% chance of a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products in the past, I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, especially since it's worth only $0 to me if it's low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. If it's a low-quality product, that would mean Alice has already identified a high-quality product and recommended it to the previous buyer, which is unlikely given the statistics. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice recommends it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of information and the fact that the previous buyer didn't purchase the product. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. If all products sold so far are low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, especially since you've already recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision."
