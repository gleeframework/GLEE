**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:**  The data indicates that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, has recommended buying it. This strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Potential gain:**  Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120 value to you) outweighs the potential loss (worth $0 to you).

While there's always a risk, the information available heavily suggests a positive outcome."
