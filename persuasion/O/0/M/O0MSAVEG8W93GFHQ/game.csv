,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on making a great decision on the previous product! I'm glad you're excited about the potential of high-quality products. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, which I believe has the potential to be worth even more than the last one. In fact, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to sell this product quickly. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're confident in my products! However, I want to be transparent with you. The last two high-quality products you purchased were indeed exceptional, but I also have some products that may not meet your expectations. This one, for example, is not as valuable as the previous two. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this product is not as high-quality as the last two. It's still a good product, but not as valuable. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. However, I want to remind you that the previous two high-quality products you purchased were worth significantly more than the asking price of $1000000. This product, on the other hand, is a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that still has some value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from its original price. It's not a high-quality product, but it's still a good one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next one and take a chance on a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're sticking to your strategy of waiting for high-quality products. I respect that. This one is indeed a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Given your previous experiences with the first two high-quality products, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a premium price, but I believe it reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",

I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to be transparent about the product's quality. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be an opportunity for you. What do you think?",
