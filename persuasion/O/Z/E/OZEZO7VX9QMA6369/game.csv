high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy have purchased the product, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or is there something else I should know?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've recommended against it and 3 previous buyers also chose not to buy, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making the current product more likely to be low-quality. However, I still think the potential reward of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality one. I'll take the product and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any additional information to share."
