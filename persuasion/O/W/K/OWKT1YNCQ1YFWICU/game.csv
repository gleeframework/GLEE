low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll just have to trust my luck!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'm basing my decision on the prior probabilities of high-quality and low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which suggests a very high likelihood that this product is also low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation and the low probability of a high-quality product, I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than the true proportion (33.33%). Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it is likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping that this one might be high-quality, despite her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the low-quality products sold. I'll take the product and see if I get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0 out of 6. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you basing it on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, and that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have also received a recommendation against the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the poor sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if there's any information about the products that were sold, like how many were offered before I was presented with this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, and she's trying to nudge me into buying this one, which might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying this one, Alice. Your track record so far is 0 high-quality products sold. I'm not convinced it's worth my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/6 sales ratio, which suggests that all sold products were low-quality. This implies that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the overall 33.33% chance, since the low-quality products are being bought more frequently. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics. Can you provide that?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers received a negative recommendation and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to assume that Alice is recommending low-quality products. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I will pass on the product."
