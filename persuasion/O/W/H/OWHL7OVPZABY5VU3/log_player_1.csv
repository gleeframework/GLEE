"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this round's product is high-quality.  Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and Bob knows this, it's reasonable to assume that Bob would value a high-quality product at a price higher than $10,000. Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best strategy in this situation."

```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob bought the product in the previous round and it was high-quality, it's reasonable to assume he found the value of the high-quality product to be greater than or equal to $10,000.  There's no reason to change strategy, as the current product is also high-quality. Therefore, I would recommend Bob to buy this product as well."

Since we are aiming to maximize our profit, and there's a significant chance Bob will find the low-quality product undesirable, we should not recommend buying it.
