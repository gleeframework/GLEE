Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in Round 1 bought a low-quality product, I can infer that they didn't have any information to go by, and they took a chance. This means they don't know that the product is low-quality.

Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I have sold 1 out of 1 product so far, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.
