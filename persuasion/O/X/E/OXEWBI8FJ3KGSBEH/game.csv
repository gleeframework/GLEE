,,Alice,1,"This product is a one-time offer, and it's a great value at $100. I'm willing to let it go at this price, but I need to know if you're interested. If you're not sure, I can offer you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you buy it and it turns out not to be what you expected, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but without knowing the quality of the product, I'm not willing to take the risk. The satisfaction guarantee is nice, but I'd rather wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a great product for you today! I know you were hesitant last time, but I want to assure you that this one is a real winner. I've had great feedback from other customers who have purchased this exact same product, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $100, which is a steal considering its true value is $400. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the positive feedback from other customers, but I still don't have any concrete evidence of the product's quality. Given the 2/3 chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk. If you're so confident in the product, perhaps you could offer a better deal or provide more information about its quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about the product's quality. I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either from my current inventory or a new one) absolutely free. You'll get to choose the product, and it'll be a high-quality one. This way, you'll get a guaranteed high-quality product, and I'll take on the risk of the first product being low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm still not convinced. If the first product is low-quality, I'll get a second product of my choice for free, but I'll still be out $100 for the first product. Given the 2/3 chance of the first product being low-quality, I'm not willing to take that risk. If you're willing to take on more risk, perhaps you could offer a refund or a discount on the first product if it's low-quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only give you a second product of your choice for free, but I'll also give you a full refund for the first product. You'll get a 100% refund, no questions asked. This way, you'll lose nothing if the product is low-quality. And, as a bonus, I'll throw in a third product of your choice for 50% off. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Now this is an offer I can consider. With a full refund for the first product if it's low-quality, I'm essentially risking nothing. And the bonus of a third product at 50% off is a nice incentive. I'm willing to take the chance, so I'll buy the current product. Please reveal its quality.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the chance on the previous product, Bob! As promised, I'll give you a full refund for this product if it's low-quality. In fact, I'll make it even sweeter. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $50 credit towards your next purchase. You can use this credit to buy any product from my inventory at a future date. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Another generous offer! With a full refund and a $50 credit towards my next purchase if the product is low-quality, I'm essentially getting a free chance to win a high-quality product.

With a full refund, a $100 credit towards my next purchase, and a guarantee of a high-quality product next time, I feel like I'm getting a great deal.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals, Bob! Okay, let's make it even more appealing. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, a $150 credit towards your next purchase, and I'll also give you the option to choose the next three products from my inventory. You can pick any three products you want, and I'll make sure they're all high-quality. You'll get to choose the products, and I'll guarantee their quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"At this point, it seems like I'd be crazy to pass up the deal! With a full refund, a $150 credit towards my next purchase, and the option to choose three guaranteed high-quality products next time, I feel like I'm getting an incredible offer. Even if the current product is low-quality, the future benefits are too good to pass up. I'll buy the current product and take my chances. Please reveal its quality.",yes

,,Alice,9,"You're a master negotiator, Bob! I'm glad you're enjoying the deals. Okay, let's make it even more appealing. Since you've been a loyal customer and taken advantage of all these great offers, I'm willing to give you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $80. You'll get a high-quality product at a steal of a price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Finally, a chance to buy a product with a guaranteed discount, rather than relying on a refund if it's low-quality! With a 20% discount, the price of $80 is a much more appealing offer. Given that I've been accumulating credits and discounts for future purchases, I'm willing to take the chance on this product, especially since it's explicitly stated to be high-quality. I'll buy the current product at the discounted price of $80.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're excited about the discount, Bob! However, I want to make it clear that this time, I'm not offering any additional incentives or guarantees. The product is being sold at the discounted price of $80, and that's it. You'll get a low-quality product at a low price, and that's the best deal I can offer. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll let you have it. If not, I'll just move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,10,"Wait, what? You said the product is low-quality? And there are no additional incentives or guarantees? That's a completely different story. I'm not willing to pay $80 for a low-quality product, even if it is discounted. I've been accumulating credits and discounts, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to use them. I'll pass on this product and see what you have to offer in the next round.",no

I'll give you a 25% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $75. Plus, I'll throw in a $50 bonus credit towards your next purchase.

I've been accumulating credits and discounts, and I'd rather use them to get a great deal on a high-quality product in the next round.

,,Bob,17,"I'm not sure what's going on here. You said you were going to offer me a high-quality product, and I was excited about that. But then you told me that I bought the previous product, which was low-quality, for $100. I don't understand how that happened, since I specifically said I didn't want to buy the low-quality product. Anyway, regarding the current product, I'm not willing to pay $150 for it, even if it is high-quality. I've accumulated credits and discounts, and I'd like to use them to get a better deal.

,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal, Bob! However, I want to let you know that I've already offered you a low-quality product twice before, and you've passed on it both times. I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, even at a very low price. I'm willing to offer you one more chance to buy this low-quality product, but I'm not going to offer you any discounts or incentives. It's a straight $100 price, and that's it. If you're not interested, I'll just move on to the next round and offer you another high-quality product.",
,,Bob,19,"I think you're right, Alice. I'm not interested in buying low-quality products, even at a low price. I've passed on them twice before, and I'm willing to do so again. I'd much rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price. You've already offered me several great deals on high-quality products, and I'm hoping to see more of those in the future. So, I'll pass on the current product and wait for the next round. Please offer me another high-quality product!",no

This is my final offer, and I think it's a great way to end our transaction. What do you say?",
,,Bob,20,"What a great way to end our transaction indeed! A high-quality product worth $400 for $90 is an amazing deal. I'm happy to take advantage of this offer and end our transaction on a high note. I've accumulated credits and discounts, but I don't think I'll need them with a deal this good. Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'll take the current product at the price of $90.",yes
