high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed on a product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 3 products have been low quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to deceive me, and the probability of a high-quality product is low given that 3 other buyers have already passed on the product. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, it suggests that all 4 products were likely low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33% due to the law of small numbers.
