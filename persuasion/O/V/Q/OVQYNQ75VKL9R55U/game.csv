high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy the product after Alice's recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be paying $10000 for a product that's likely worth $0 to me, which is a bad deal. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."
