,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll take the product and see what I get.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products in total, and two of them were high-quality. The odds are looking good for this one.

The price remains the same: $10000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to think that you're not infallible.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Twelve in a row, and then a bump in the road. I'm back to selling a low-quality product. Don't let this one throw you off, though. I've still sold 12 high-quality products out of 14 total, which is a 85.7% success rate. That's a pretty strong track record. This product is low-quality, but it's still a unique opportunity to own something that's not like the other 12 high-quality products. It's a chance to own something different. I'm offering it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. With a 85.7% success rate, I'd expect a high-quality product. Since you're telling me this one is low-quality, I'm going to pass on it.",no
