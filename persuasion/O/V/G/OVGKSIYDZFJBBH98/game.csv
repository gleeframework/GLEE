,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put it this way: the product I'm offering is something that would make your competitors green with envy. It's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. If you're not convinced, I can give you a second chance to reconsider. What do you say?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me be transparent with you - I'm not just willing to sell this product at a low price because there's something wrong with it. In fact, it's the opposite. I'm willing to sell it to you at $1000000 because I know it's worth so much more to the right buyer. I'm looking for a partner who will appreciate its true value, and I believe that partner is you. If you're not willing to take the risk, I'll have to consider other options.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm still not convinced, though. I'd like to know more about the potential risks involved. What are the chances that the product won't be worth $4000000 to me? Is there a chance it could be low-quality?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be honest with you - there's always a risk with any purchase. However, I can tell you that the chances of this product being low-quality are extremely low. In fact, I'd say it's less than 1%. As for the potential value, I'd say there's a 50% chance it will be worth $4000000 to you, and a 50% chance it will be worth $0. But I'm willing to take that risk, and I'm willing to let you take it too. The price remains the same - $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll take the product at $1000000.",yes

This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I want to make it clear that the odds are still the same - 50% chance it's worth $4000000, and 50% chance it's worth $0. Are you willing to take another chance and potentially double your gains?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm ready to take another risk so soon. I just got lucky with the last product, and I don't want to get burned again. I'll have to think about it and get back to you later.",no
