,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and she's trying to avoid selling another low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
