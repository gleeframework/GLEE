,,Alice,1,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far. You have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. It's a great deal at $100, a price that's 25% of its true value. Buy now and get a great deal!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. However, the law of large numbers suggests that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold should converge to the true ratio.
