I'm proud to say that 50% of my products are high-quality, which is exactly the expected rate. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, which is a nice streak. Maybe this next one will be just as lucky?

Alice's message: You're a statistician, I love it! You're right, the events are independent, and the probability remains 50%. But let me ask you, don't you think that if I were selling low-quality products, I'd be out of business by now? I've already sold 2 high-quality products, and I'm still standing. That suggests that I might have a bit of a knack for this. And at $1000000, this is a risk-free opportunity to get a $4000000 product. What do you say?

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 3 total products. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: think of it this way - if I were just randomly guessing, you'd expect to see 1.5 high-quality products by now, but I've actually sold 3. That's a 50% surplus of high-quality products. I'm not just lucky, I'm good at what I do. And at $1000000, this is a chance to get a $4000000 product with a potentially higher-than-expected probability of success. What do you think?
