* **No information to suggest otherwise:** There's no previous sales history to indicate a pattern of low-quality products.
* **Potential for high reward:** Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

**Recommendation:** In this scenario, it's statistically advantageous for the buyer to buy the product."
