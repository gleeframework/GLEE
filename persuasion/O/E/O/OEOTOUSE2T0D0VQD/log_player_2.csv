Alice's message: Hello! I understand your desire for more information, and I apologize if my previous messages were unclear. The distribution of high-quality products across the previous rounds is as follows: Round 2 and Round 5 had high-quality products, but only the one in Round 2 was purchased. Round 9 also had a high-quality product, but it wasn't purchased. As for why the high-quality products in Rounds 5 and 9 weren't purchased, I can only speculate that the buyers were uncertain about the product's quality or were deterred by the overall probability.
