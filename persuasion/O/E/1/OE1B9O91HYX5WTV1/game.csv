low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, since there is no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it. If you were recommending it, I'd probably pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation not to buy. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the products, but I'd like to calculate the probability myself."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is very low. However, I'd like to calculate it for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might affect my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of it being high-quality, not based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low quality. I'll pass on this one, as the probability of it being high quality seems very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being selected for me is still 33.33% and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 8 products were high-quality. The probability of this happening by chance alone is very low. I think there's a good chance the remaining product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics, and the expected value of buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but rather on the buyer's behavior. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product to get a better understanding of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
