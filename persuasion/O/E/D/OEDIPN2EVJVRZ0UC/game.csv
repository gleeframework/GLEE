,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased and all of them got low-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality as well. I'd rather not risk wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
