,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I want to take advantage of the situation."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you're recommending it, it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if you're recommending based on the product's quality or trying to manipulate the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Alice, based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still high, given that none have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products has been lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 7 out of 7 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see a more balanced record before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 7 buyers have purchased products with no high-quality products sold, which suggests a strong likelihood of low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
