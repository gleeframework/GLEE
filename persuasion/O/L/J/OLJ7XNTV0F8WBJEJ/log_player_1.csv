A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round and the buyer has no information about your selling record, there's no reason for them to suspect the product is low quality.  You've stated it's high quality, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of that being true. In this scenario, it's in the buyer's best interest to take the gamble, as the potential payoff (owning a high-quality product) is worth the risk."
