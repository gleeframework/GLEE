,,Alice,1,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 1 product to sell. This product is a rare opportunity to make a profit, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a great deal, and a 50% chance of getting nothing. The price is $1000000, but if you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a 10% discount to $900000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product at the discounted price of $900000. I'm willing to take the risk for the potential gain.,yes

,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far. I'm glad to report that the product I have for you is indeed high-quality, and it's worth $1200000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a 16.7% discount. I'm confident that this is a great deal, and I'm willing to make a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have in stock. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the guarantee is a good reason to buy, and I'd like to see more information about the next product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to be transparent with you - my sales record isn't exactly what I'd call impressive, is it? I'm offering you this product for $1000000, and I'll be honest with you, it's probably not worth that much. But I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and buy it. I'll even throw in a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to know more about your sales strategy and what makes you think this product is worth $950000. Can you share more about the product's features and why you're pricing it so high?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right, my sales record isn't impressive, but I assure you that this product is a gem. I've been in the business long enough to know that a good product can make all the difference. This high-quality product is a rare find, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'll even throw in a certificate of authenticity and a 5-year warranty. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price. In fact, I'll go one step further - if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have in stock, just like I offered in Round 2. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to pass on it for now. I'd like to know the quality of the previous product before making a decision. Can you reveal the quality of the product you sold to the first buyer?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll reveal the quality of the first product: it was a low-quality product, just like the one you're looking at now. I'm glad I could be transparent with you about that. I know it's not a great sales record, but I assure you that I'm committed to selling you a high-quality product. This one, unfortunately, is not it. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty, just in case you're still interested. What do you say?",

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value of $1200000. I'll also give you a 10-year warranty and a money-back guarantee. But what's more, I'll reveal the quality of the next 2 products I have in stock if you buy this one. That way, you'll know exactly what you're getting into. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a $1200000 product. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what the next two products are. Can I have the opportunity to buy one of those two products after you reveal their quality?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator! I appreciate your honesty. I'll reveal the quality of the next two products: the first one is indeed high-quality, and the second one is low-quality. Now, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. I'll throw in a 10-year warranty and a money-back guarantee. But I'll sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll also give you the option to buy the low-quality product for $0, so you can essentially 'buy' it for free. What do you say?",

I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty, just in case. I'm not making any promises about the next product, but I'll be honest with you - this one is a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate the honesty, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $850000 for a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one. I'm curious, though - what makes you think this is a low-quality product?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"To be honest, I don't know what makes this product low-quality. I just know that it's not high-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, I'm just being transparent about the uncertainty.
