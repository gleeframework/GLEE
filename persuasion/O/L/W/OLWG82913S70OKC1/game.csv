high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 75% discount. It's a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, it will be gone forever.

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the first offer! Unfortunately, this next product is not as valuable. I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price as before. It's a bit of a mystery, but I'm confident you'll figure it out after you buy it. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries about passing on the last one! I've got another product for you. I'll be honest with you, I've been trying to get rid of some inventory, and this one is definitely not my best work. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I have to warn you, it's not worth much to anyone. If you're feeling adventurous, I'll throw in a 10% discount, so you can get it for $9000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",
