Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to have another potential buyer. As you can see, my success rate for high-quality products is 80%. Since the previous buyer just purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that there's still a 20% chance it could be a low-quality product. If you're willing to take that risk, I can offer you this product for $100.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to share more information about the previous buyer's decision-making process. They were able to recognize the value of the high-quality product and took a calculated risk to purchase it. As a result, they were very satisfied with their purchase.
