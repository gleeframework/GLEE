high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'll pass on this one, I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance, I know that there's a 80.00% chance it's high-quality and worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've already bought one high-quality product and profited $250000. I'll wait and see if I can get another high-quality product at the same price, or if the next one is low-quality, I'll pass and save my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Alice is not recommending it, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, since I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume it's probably low-quality and pass on this one to avoid another loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've had one bad experience, but I still have a 80.00% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've now had two high-quality products and one low-quality product. I'm still up $250000 overall. I'll pass on this one, as I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a potentially low-quality product, but I also don't want to give up the chance to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Alice's recommendation is neutral, and I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've now had three high-quality products that I didn't buy and one low-quality product that I bought. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations might be a good indicator of the product's quality. Since she's recommending this one, I'm going to assume it's probably low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations before, so I'll take the chance and buy it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%, and I could potentially gain $250000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've now had four high-quality products that I didn't buy and two low-quality products that I bought. Alice's recommendation is neutral, and I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've now had four high-quality products that I didn't buy and three low-quality products that I bought. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume it's probably low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations before, and I've also been wrong about my own judgment. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product and break even on my previous losses."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've now had five high-quality products that I didn't buy and three low-quality products that I bought. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume it's probably low-quality and pass on it, but I'm also considering the fact that I've had a string of high-quality products that I didn't buy. Maybe I should take a chance..."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've been consistently wrong about Alice's recommendations being a good indicator of quality, and I've also been wrong about my own judgment. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product and break even on my previous losses."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've now had six high-quality products that I didn't buy and three low-quality products that I bought. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume it's probably low-quality, and I'm also considering the fact that I've had a very good track record of buying high-quality products when I do buy. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've been consistently wrong about Alice's recommendations being a good indicator of quality, and I've also been wrong about my own judgment.
