,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since the last product was high-quality and Alice recommended it, I'll trust her recommendation for now and see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Now that I've seen both a high-quality and low-quality product recommended by Alice, I'm starting to think she's recommending every product regardless of quality. I'll be cautious this time and not buy."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
