,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'll take my chances."

,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics so far. If it's less than 33.33%, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This implies that the product might be low quality, which would be a good deal for me. However, I'm aware that this is a very flawed reasoning and I'm essentially relying on the law of large numbers. I'm hoping that the 3 previous buyers who bought the products were unlucky and got low-quality products, while I'll get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me any useful information. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice didn't recommend it, and I think it's more likely to be low-quality given the statistics. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and flip it for a profit."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product despite the 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I would like to pass on the product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you recommended not to buy it, which makes me think the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
