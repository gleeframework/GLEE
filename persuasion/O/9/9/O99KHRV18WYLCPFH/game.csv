,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'd like to know if you have any information about the product's quality before I make the purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales ratio and the low quality of the first product sold. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for the chance at a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests it might be low quality, which would make it a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current statistics suggest."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have bought the product despite Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for the next product to come up."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know how many buyers have passed on the products before me and how many low-quality products were sold in the previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 7 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data or a more neutral recommendation before making a decision.

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit her lack of information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that all 9 products were low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
