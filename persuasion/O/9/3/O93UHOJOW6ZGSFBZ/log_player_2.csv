It's a rare chance to get a product that's worth so much more than that. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?

Let's just say that this product has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by industry experts, and they're confident that it's a game-changer. Would you like to take a chance on it for $10000?

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your desire to see the product in action, Bob!

But I can offer you a special deal - if you buy it now, I'll throw in a personalized consultation with one of the industry experts who reviewed the product. They'll be able to answer any questions you have and show you how to get the most out of it. And, of course, you'll get the product for the same price of $10000. What do you say?

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I want to remind you that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to make another deal like this. Think about it this way: even if the product doesn't meet your expectations, you've only lost $10000. But if it does meet your expectations, you'll be getting an incredible value. And who knows, you might even be able to resell it for a profit. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off big time. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance?
