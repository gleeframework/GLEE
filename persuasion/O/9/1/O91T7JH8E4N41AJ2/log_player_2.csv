Alice's message: Hello buyer, this is a great opportunity to buy a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm not giving you any additional information about this specific product. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk or not.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

The fact that no one has bought yet doesn't change the 50% probability of this product being high-quality.
