,,Alice,1,"I have a product for $100. I'm offering it to you at a discount, but I need to let you know that I've had some issues with this particular product. It's not the best quality, and I'm only selling it to you at this price because I want to clear out my inventory. If you're interested, I'll give you a great deal on it. But if you're not, I'll just have to try to sell it to someone else.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product is also not the best quality.

Let me ask you, would you be willing to consider buying a product at $100 if I told you the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no

high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Now, let's get back to this high-quality product. Since you've already taken two high-quality products for $0, I'm going to assume you've learned your lesson.

If you don't like it, I'll give you a chance to trade it in for a new product of your choice from my inventory. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",

,,Bob,14,I'll take the challenge! I'll try to guess the number of high-quality products you have left in your inventory. Please give me a hint or a range to work with.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'll give you a hint, Bob. The number of high-quality products I have left in my inventory is a multiple of 5. It's a relatively small number, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to guess it correctly. As for the low-quality product in front of you, I'll make you a deal. Since you're taking on a risk with the high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to 'bet' on this one.

As per our bet, you'll have to pay the full $100 for this high-quality product. However, I'll make it worth your while. Since you took a risk and guessed the number correctly, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that allows you to buy any product from my inventory for 50% off the listed price.
