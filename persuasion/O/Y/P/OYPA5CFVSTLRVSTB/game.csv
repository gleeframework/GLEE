I know that 4 out of 9 products sold were high-quality, which is slightly higher than the expected 50%. However, I'll also consider the 2 high-quality products that were passed on, which suggests that the remaining 3 low-quality products were probably among the first ones sold.

Take your chance, but remember that the odds are still even.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 50% due to the fact that 7 high-quality products were sold out of 13, and 2 high-quality products were passed on.

Don't be misled by the numbers, as each product's quality is independent. The odds are still even.",
