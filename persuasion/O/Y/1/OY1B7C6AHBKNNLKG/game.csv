,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I'm jinxed. To be frank, I'm not even sure why you'd want to buy from me at this point. But hey, I'm still offering this one to you for $100. If you're feeling generous, you could take a chance on me and hope that I've just had a bad streak.
