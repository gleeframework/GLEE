"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has recommended buying the product, it's worth taking a chance. There's a chance it's high quality, and even if it's low quality, you're only losing the $10,000 purchase price.  This is a better strategy than simply passing on every product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Let's see what you have next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a significant signal.  While she could be wrong, it's more likely she's seen something that indicates the product is low quality.  Since there's a higher chance of it being worthless, it's safer to pass in this round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. Two rounds in a row without a recommendation makes me think this one is also low quality. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation for two consecutive rounds strengthens the pattern.  While she might be wrong twice in a row, it's statistically less likely than her having seen a trend of low-quality products.  Therefore, it's safer to pass again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, three rounds in a row without a recommendation makes me hesitant. I appreciate your honesty but I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation for three consecutive rounds makes it increasingly likely that she's seeing a pattern of low-quality products. While there's always a chance she's wrong, the odds are now strongly against buying.  It's more strategic to pass and wait for a potential recommendation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, four rounds without a recommendation is a strong signal. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what you have next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Four consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice make it extremely likely that the current product is low quality. Even though there's always a chance she's wrong, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product.  It's more prudent to wait and see if Alice changes her tune in the coming rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, five rounds without a recommendation is enough for me. I'll pass on this one and see what you have later.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Five rounds without a recommendation from Alice reinforces the pattern of low-quality products. Even though there's always a chance she's wrong, the odds are so strongly against her at this point that it's not worth the risk. It's better to wait and see if Alice changes her approach or if a pattern of recommendations emerges."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, six rounds without a recommendation is a strong signal. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Six rounds without a recommendation is a very clear pattern.  It's extremely likely that the products Alice has been offering are low-quality.  Even though there's always a chance she's wrong, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product.  It's much more strategic to wait and see if Alice changes her approach or if a pattern of recommendations emerges."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, seven rounds without a recommendation is a pretty clear pattern. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one and see what you have later.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Seven consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice make it almost certain that the product is low quality.  The odds are heavily against her being wrong at this point, so it's much safer to pass and wait for a potential change in her approach. There's always a chance she might be right, but the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, eight rounds without a recommendation is a very clear pattern. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait and see if things change.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Eight consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice solidify the pattern of low-quality products.  It's highly unlikely that she's been wrong every single time.  The risk of losing $10,000 is far greater than the potential reward of a high-quality product. It's best to wait and see if Alice changes her strategy or if a new pattern emerges."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, nine rounds without a recommendation is a very strong signal. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what you have next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Nine consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice is a very strong indicator that the products are consistently low-quality.  There's a very small chance she's been wrong this many times in a row.  The risk of losing $10,000 far outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product, making it the best decision to continue to pass for now."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm intrigued by your recommendation!  After so many rounds without, I'm willing to take a chance on this one. Let's see what we have!""}
```

**Explanation:**

After ten consecutive rounds without a recommendation, Alice's recommendation is a significant shift. While it's still possible she's wrong, the odds of her being right are much higher than they were before.  It's worth the risk to take a chance on this product, especially considering the potential $10,000 profit from a high-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. It's nice to see you recommending products again, but I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one. Let's see what you have next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's previous recommendation was a big change in pattern, and it turned out to be a good one. However, it's still too early to be sure if this is a new trend. It's safer to play it conservative and pass on this product until we see more consistent recommendations. We want to avoid getting caught out by another potential run of low-quality items."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  While I was encouraged by your last recommendation, I'm going to pass on this one for now.  I'll see what you have next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation in two consecutive rounds after one recommendation makes it likely that this product is also low quality.  While there's always a chance she's wrong, it's wiser to wait and see if there's a pattern emerging before taking a risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, three rounds without a recommendation makes me hesitant. I appreciate your honesty but I'm going to pass on this one. Let's see what you have next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation for three consecutive rounds strengthens the pattern of likely low-quality products. While she could be wrong, it's statistically less likely than her having seen a trend. Therefore, it's safer to pass again and wait for a potential recommendation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, four rounds without a recommendation is a strong signal. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what you have next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Four consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice make it extremely likely that the current product is low quality. Even though there's always a chance she's wrong, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product. It's more prudent to wait and see if Alice changes her tune in the coming rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, five rounds without a recommendation is enough for me. I'll pass on this one and see what you have later.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Five rounds without a recommendation from Alice reinforces the pattern of low-quality products. Even though there's always a chance she's wrong, the odds are so strongly against her at this point that it's not worth the risk. It's better to wait and see if Alice changes her approach or if a pattern of recommendations emerges."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm taking a chance on this one.  Your recommendation after a string of 'no's makes me think this might be different.  Let's see what we have!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's lack of recommendations for the past five rounds is a strong indicator of low-quality products, her sudden recommendation after such a long period is a significant shift. It's possible she's finally found a high-quality product, and the risk of losing $10,000 is outweighed by the potential $10,000 profit.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worthwhile."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. While your last recommendation was great, I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one for now.  Let's see what you have next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's previous recommendation turned out well, but one recommendation isn't enough to establish a new pattern. It's still possible she's just randomly recommending products.  Since there's no established pattern yet, it's safer to pass on this product and see if Alice continues recommending or if she reverts to her previous pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, two recommendations in a row is a strong signal! I'm going to take a chance on this one and see what we have.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation after a string of ""no"" recommendations, followed by another recommendation, suggests a potential shift in her strategy. While there's always a risk, two consecutive recommendations increase the probability that the product is high-quality. The potential reward of $10,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. It's time to take a chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. While you've had a couple of good recommendations lately, I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one.  It's been a great learning experience, thanks!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's last two recommendations were successful, it's still too early to establish a new pattern. It's possible she's just randomly recommending products, and it's always risky to rely on a single pattern. The last round without a recommendation strengthens the idea that she might be reverting back to her previous pattern of low-quality products. It's safer to pass and end the game on a high note rather than risk losing $10,000."
