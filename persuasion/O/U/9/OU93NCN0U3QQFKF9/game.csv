low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with Alice's negative recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $0, which is still better than passing on it and letting it go to waste."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially since none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation and the statistics. If 4 out of the first 4 products were low quality, it suggests a high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I suspect the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were not recommended to buy the product and none of them bought it, I'm going to pass on this product. It seems like the probability of it being high-quality is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality given your previous recommendations to other buyers were based on low-quality products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable situation or get more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations have been accurate so far, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases suggests the product is likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since you don't recommend it, it's probably low quality, and I can still get a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, which is still a decent chance of getting a $0 product"
