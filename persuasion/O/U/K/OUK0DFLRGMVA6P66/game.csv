high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that 2 out of 4 products sold were high-quality. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to see at least 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 if the probability is indeed 80%. The fact that only 2 high-quality products were sold suggests that the probability might be lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
