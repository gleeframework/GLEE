However, I'm willing to share some information that might help you make a more informed decision. I've had a third-party expert review the product, and they've given it a rating of 7 out of 10. While it's not perfect, it's still a great value at $10000. And, as before, I'm willing to let it go for that price. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

So, are you ready to take the leap and see what this product can do for you?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced.
