,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. Am I missing something? Can you explain your thought process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I've considered the statistics. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the prior 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, is there something I'm missing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products. Is there any information available?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Since 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the products despite none of them being high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, regardless of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price of $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them ended up buying high-quality products. I think there's a good chance that the product I'm being offered is low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low sales rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that you've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'm not taking your recommendation into consideration."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because you've recommended against it, which makes me suspect it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product and potentially wasting $100, but I'd also like to see if I can get a high-quality product at a discount."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
