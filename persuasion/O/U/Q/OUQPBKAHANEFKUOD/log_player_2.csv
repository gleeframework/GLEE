Since I've sold 0 out of 0 products so far, I'm not sure how valuable this one will be to you. But I assure you that this product is one of the good ones! Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. As you may know, I've already sold one product, and it was high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've also got a 50% chance of selling low-quality products. Since I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, it's possible that this one might not be the best.

Alice's message: Ahah, great question! With only one sale so far, and it being high-quality, I'd say the probability of this next product being high-quality is still 50%. I've got a 50% chance of selling low-quality products, and since this one is the second product, it's just as likely to be low-quality as high-quality.

I don't have any information about them that would make them more likely to buy a high-quality product. They just took a chance and bought it because they were the first one to arrive. And now, I've got another high-quality product here! This one is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?
