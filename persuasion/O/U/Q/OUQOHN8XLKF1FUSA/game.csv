low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your request! With 2 products sold, 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality, the actual probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is likely to converge to the true proportion as the number of products sold increases. Considering this, I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious to know how many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.",no

,,Alice,10,"Congratulations to the previous buyer on their purchase! As of now, I've sold a total of 8 products, with 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. The proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 75%. With this consistent trend, I'm confident that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than the initial 50%. Would you like to take advantage of this streak and buy this high-quality product for $100, considering the strong evidence in favor of high-quality products?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50% based on the binomial distribution, even with the updated statistics. The proportion of high-quality products sold so far is indeed 75%, but this is likely due to chance. I'd like to make an informed decision based on the true probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 50%. Can I have a moment to think about it?",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your careful consideration! You're correct that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is likely due to chance. I appreciate your desire to make an informed decision. As of now, I've sold a total of 9 products, with 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products.
