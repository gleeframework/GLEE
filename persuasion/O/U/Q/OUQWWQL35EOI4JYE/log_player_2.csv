The refund will be a one-time payment, not a discount on a future purchase. Now, let's talk about the product itself: it's a low-quality item, but I'm selling it to you for $100. I know it's not worth that to you, but I'm willing to make a deal. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free product with your next purchase, and I'll give you a 50% discount on that product.
