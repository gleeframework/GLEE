``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We have very little data to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This could be a lucky coincidence.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and we have no reason to suspect she's acting in bad faith.  Her recommendation is a signal, even if it's a weak one.
* **Potential Upside:** If the product is high quality, we make a $20 profit. If it's low quality, we lose $100. The potential reward outweighs the potential loss. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** Since the odds are 50/50, this is a bit of a gamble, but it's a calculated risk.

**Note:**  This is a game theory scenario where there's no perfect solution.  We are balancing potential profit with the risk of loss based on limited information."
