* The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* The price is $1,000,000.

Even though you haven't sold any products before,  the expected value of this purchase is positive: 

* 33.33% chance of a $1,200,000 product, costing $1,000,000 = $200,000 profit
* 66.67% chance of a $0 product, costing $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000 loss
* Expected value: (0.3333 * $200,000) + (0.6667 * -$1,000,000) = ~$10,000
