,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low recommendation rate from Alice and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'll take a chance based on your previous sales record. However, I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards the high-quality products that have been sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 7 buyers purchased high-quality products, which is a 42.86% success rate. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll pass on this product and let you know if it's high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice doesn't know how much each product is worth to me, and I have no information about the quality of the product. The statistics show that 3 out of 7 buyers have purchased high-quality products, which is a relatively low proportion, suggesting that there may be more low-quality products remaining. Given the potential reward of a high-quality product ($1200000), I think it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record, please."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after I pass, and I'd like Alice to explain her recommendation. I'm not sure why she would recommend a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality."
