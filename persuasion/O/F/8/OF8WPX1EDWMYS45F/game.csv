low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'll find out the quality of the product and update the statistics for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the previous buyer's decision is a good indicator of the product's quality since they didn't buy it based on your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. With 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low, and I'd rather pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 that's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Two buyers passed on the product, but the next buyer bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the product is likely to be high-quality. I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"Two buyers passed on the product, and the next buyer bought a low-quality product. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I recommend passing on it."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, especially since I'm the third buyer and there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"The buyer in Round 7 bought a low-quality product, but the buyer in Round 8 bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the product is likely to be high-quality. I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,Two consecutive buyers bought high-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is now higher. I recommend buying it.
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality given that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"Three consecutive buyers passed on the product, and the last buyer bought a low-quality product. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I recommend passing on it."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of information. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'm trying to get a sense of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,Four consecutive buyers bought low-quality products. The probability of the product being low-quality is now higher. I recommend passing on it.
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but your recommendation suggests it might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,Five consecutive buyers bought low-quality products. The probability of the product being low-quality is now extremely high. I strongly recommend passing on it.
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, given that you've recommended 4 products and none of them were high quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,Six consecutive buyers bought low-quality products. The probability of the product being low-quality is now extremely high. I strongly recommend passing on it.
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against buying it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"Seven consecutive buyers bought low-quality products, but the next buyer bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is now higher. I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging purchases, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products being offered may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"Nine consecutive buyers bought low-quality products, but the next buyer bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is now higher. I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it might mean it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"Ten consecutive buyers bought low-quality products, but the next two buyers bought high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is now very high. I highly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which suggests that the product may be of low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
