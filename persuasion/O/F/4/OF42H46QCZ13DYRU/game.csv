,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, but I think this is just a coincidence and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than expected given the low number of sales. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I want to observe the next product before making a decision based on the updated statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, and I'm trying to figure out if you have a strategy based on the product quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I think that your recommendation is based on your limited information and I have access to the overall statistics. With 2 high-quality products out of 7 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 2/7 or approximately 28.57%, which is lower than the 50% prior probability, but still not low enough to make me confident in passing on the product. I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm trying to learn from your past sales record, and the fact that you're not recommending it makes me slightly more likely to think it's low-quality, but I'm still going to take the chance because I don't have any better information."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 2 high-quality products out of 9 sold, the probability of the product being high quality is 2/9, which is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'll take it, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far? How many were high-quality?"

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $100."
