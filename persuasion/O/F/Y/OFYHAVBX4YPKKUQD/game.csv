,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on a lack of information. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it, not because I have any information to go on."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low-quality product sold to the previous buyer?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to observe more data before making a decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.25, which is lower than the true probability of 0.80. I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to see the statistics of the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the recommendation Alice would give me if I were to ask her to reveal the product's quality without buying it."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there's a higher proportion of high-quality products sold so far, but I'm not sure if it's representative of the overall population. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that previous buyers have bought the product."
