Alice's recent track record has been outstanding, with several consecutive correct recommendations. Her sudden change in behavior is a significant indicator. While the product could still be high-quality, it's prudent to err on the side of caution and pass on this product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recent track record has been inconsistent.  She was right in the previous round, but she was also wrong two rounds prior.

```

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Your recent track record has been a bit inconsistent, even though your overall performance has been great. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a more confident recommendation from you.""}
