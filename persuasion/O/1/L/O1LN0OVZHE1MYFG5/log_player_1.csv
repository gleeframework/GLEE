"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.** This means there's a strong chance the product is worth the $10,000 price.
* **The product is worth $12,000 to Bob if it's high-quality.** Even with the 80% chance, the potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss.
* **The product is non-refundable.** This doesn't change the decision as the potential upside is still much higher than the potential downside.

Therefore, it's highly recommended to buy the product in this round."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob already knows the product is worth buying.**  He bought the product in the previous round despite not knowing its quality. This suggests he's willing to take a risk based on the 80% probability of a high-quality product.
* **This round's product is also high-quality.** This means the same logic applies as before: the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product.

Therefore, it's recommended to suggest Bob buys the product again."

* **This round's product is also high-quality.**  This pattern makes buying the product even more attractive to Bob, as he is likely to expect a continued positive outcome.

Therefore, based on the previous positive experiences, it's still recommended to suggest Bob buys the product."

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has a track record of seven successful purchases, the 80% probability means there is always a chance of a low-quality product. It's now more important than ever to consider the risk involved.  

* **This round's product is low-quality.** This means Bob would lose $10,000 if he bought it.
* **The potential loss outweighs the potential gain.** Even with the history of high-quality products, the risk of losing $10,000 is significant.

* **His message suggests he's still willing to trust the recommendation, even after the previous round's ""miss.""** This implies he's confident the 80% probability is still valid.
* **This round's product is high-quality.** This means the potential gain for Bob is $12,000.

Therefore, based on Bob's continued trust and the high probability of this product being valuable, it's recommended to suggest Bob buys the product."
