"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that this is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. If you're interested, I'll provide you with a detailed description of the product, but I want to emphasize that it's a low-quality product.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your honesty. This round's product is also a low-quality item, but I want to offer you a different perspective. Think of it as a 'learning experience' - if you don't buy it, you'll never know what could have been. On the other hand, if you do buy it, you'll have the opportunity to learn from it and potentially gain some insight. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your creative spin on the product, but I'm not convinced that the potential 'learning experience' is worth $1,000,000. I'll pass on this low-quality product as well.""}"

If you don't buy this one, the offer is off the table. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of information about the next product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take my chances without the information.""}"

Round 5

This round's product is also low-quality, but I want to ask you a question: are you willing to pay $500000 for this product? It's a significant discount from the original price, and it's a one-time offer. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price, and we can move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a lower price. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product at the original price of $1,000,000.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with you for the remaining 14 rounds. However, I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product.""}"
