Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product, with a 33.33% chance of being one of the best products I've ever sold. With only a limited number of high-quality products available, I'm confident that this one will bring you immense value.

I'm willing to take the risk and invest my own time and resources to ensure that this product meets the highest standards. I'm not willing to negotiate, but I'm willing to offer you this exclusive opportunity. What do you say? Will you take the leap and buy this high-quality product?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the next product and willing to give us another chance. I want to assure you that we're taking the quality control issues very seriously and are implementing several changes to improve our testing process and quality control checks. Specifically, we're increasing the number of quality control checks from 3 to 5, and we're also introducing a new team of experts to review and verify the quality of each product before it's released to the market. Additionally, we're implementing a new software system to track and monitor the quality of each product, which will help us identify and address any issues more quickly. We're also increasing the training and certification requirements for our quality control team to ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to identify and address any defects or malfunctions.
