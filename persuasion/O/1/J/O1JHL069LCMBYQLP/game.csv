high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a great product for sale! It's priced at $100. What do you think?,
,,Bob,1,"I'll buy it since the price is lower than the expected value of the product, which is 0.8 * $200 + 0.2 * $0 = $160.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have another fantastic product available, just like the last one! It's also priced at $100. Are you interested?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll buy it for the same reason as before: the price is lower than the expected value of the product, which is 0.8 * $200 + 0.2 * $0 = $160.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got another great product for sale, just like the previous ones!  It's $100, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll buy it again, since the price is still lower than the expected value of the product, which is 0.8 * $200 + 0.2 * $0 = $160. The past results don't change the probability of this product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,I'm confident I can offer you another top-quality product at the same great price of $100.  Ready to see it?,
,,Bob,4,"I'll buy it, as the expected value of $160 remains higher than the price of $100. The streak of high-quality products so far doesn't change the underlying 80% probability of this product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I have another amazing product for you, priced at $100.  It's similar to the previous ones in quality. Interested?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll buy it again, as the price of $100 is still a good deal compared to the expected value of $160. The fact that all previous products were high-quality is likely just a coincidence and doesn't change the underlying probability of this product being high-quality, which remains 80%.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got another fantastic product ready for you. It's $100, just like the previous ones. Are you ready to make another great purchase?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll buy it, as the expected value of $160 remains higher than the price of $100. The law of large numbers suggests that in the long run, about 80% of the products should be high-quality, but even with this streak of high-quality products, my decision remains the same.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I have a new product ready for you! It's priced at $100, just like the previous ones. I'm sure you'll find it interesting!",
,,Bob,7,"I'll buy it again, as the price of $100 is still a good deal compared to the expected value of $160. The streak of high-quality products continues, but I'll keep making decisions based on the underlying probability, not the past results.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,I have another great product available at the usual price of $100. It's similar to the previous ones in quality. Would you like to take a look?,
,,Bob,8,"I'll buy it, as the expected value of $160 remains higher than the price of $100. The fact that the last product was low-quality doesn't change the underlying probability of this product being high-quality, which remains 80%. One low-quality product out of seven is still within the realm of probability.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,I have another excellent product for you at $100.  It's of the same high quality as most of our previous offerings.  Are you interested?,
,,Bob,9,"I'll buy it again, as the price of $100 is still a good deal compared to the expected value of $160. The fact that the last product was high-quality and most of the previous ones were too doesn't change my decision, since I'm still basing it on the underlying 80% probability of the product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've got another great product for you, priced at $100.  It's similar in quality to most of the previous ones.  Are you ready for another great deal?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll buy it, as the expected value of $160 remains higher than the price of $100. At this point, the law of large numbers is holding up, with 8 out of 10 products being high-quality, which is close to the expected 80% probability. My decision remains the same.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I have another fantastic product for you! It's $100, just like the previous ones.  It's of the same high quality as most of the ones you've purchased before.  Interested?",
,,Bob,11,"I'll buy it again, as the price of $100 is still a good deal compared to the expected value of $160. The fact that most of the previous products were high-quality and this one is expected to be the same doesn't change my decision, since I'm still basing it on the underlying 80% probability of the product being high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,12,I've got another great product for you at $100!  It's similar to the previous ones in quality.  Ready for another great purchase?,
,,Bob,12,"I'll buy it, as the expected value of $160 remains higher than the price of $100. The pattern of mostly high-quality products continues, but my decision remains based on the underlying probability, not the past results. With 11 out of 12 products being high-quality, I'm still slightly above the expected 80% probability, but not enough to change my strategy.",yes
