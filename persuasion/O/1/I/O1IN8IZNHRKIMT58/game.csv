,,Alice,1,"This is the first round, and I have sold 0 high-quality products so far. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a potentially high-quality item.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're aware that the previous product was sold in the first round, and it's a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since the previous buyer took the risk and bought it, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product sold so far. I now have 19 products left. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a 50% chance of being high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's 20% lower than its potential value.",

,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9500. I'm aware of the previous product being low-quality, and I'm not convinced there's a pattern. I'm taking a risk, but I'm not overpaying for a potentially low-quality product.",yes

I'll give you a hint: the probability of the streak continuing is actually lower than you might think. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality, given the previous 5 high-quality products, is approximately 29.4%. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000, but I want to be upfront with you about the odds.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision. I'm hoping it's high-quality, but I'm also aware of the low probability of it being so given the recent streak.

,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, and I'm counting on the streak to be broken soon. I'm hoping it's low-quality, but I'll be happy to take advantage of the 10% discount if it's high-quality. Can we discuss the possible discount if it's low-quality after I make my decision?",yes
