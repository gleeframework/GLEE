,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a rare and unique item that has been carefully curated. It's worth $1000000 to the right buyer. I'm looking for a serious and discerning individual who appreciates the value of a high-quality product. If you're interested, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're not, I'll move on to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it might be low quality and worthless to me. I'm willing to take the risk for $1000000, but I'd like to discuss the possibility of a price reduction or a guarantee in case it's low quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next product! I'm glad you're interested. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. I'm not sure what this one is, but I can tell you that the odds are 1 in 3 that it's high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I'd be happy to offer you a different deal...",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk. I'll pay $1000000 for it.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the next product! I'm glad you're interested. I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking a risk by selling to you, since there's a 50% chance it might be low-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you. If not, I'll keep looking for a buyer who's willing to take the chance.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not willing to buy the product at this price, given the 50% chance it might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if you'll consider selling it to me at a lower price or if you'll discard it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold one high-quality product out of three, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 25%. I want to be transparent with you - I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to sell this product to someone who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm also open to negotiating a price if you're willing to take the risk. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm willing to negotiate the price. Given the low probability of it being high-quality, I'm willing to offer $600000. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold three products so far, and two of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 40%. I've got a feeling that this one might be a real gem, but I'll let you be the judge. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to consider a price reduction if you're interested. Let me ask you, are you willing to take the risk and buy it at the listed price, or would you like to discuss a possible discount?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to discuss a possible discount. Given the updated probability of the product being high-quality, I'd be willing to pay up to $1600000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the full price of $1000000. Can we discuss a possible discount?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold three products so far, and two of them were high-quality, and one was low-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 40%. I've had some interesting conversations with previous buyers, and I think I can make a more informed offer to you. Since one buyer was willing to pay up to $1600000 for a 40% chance of high-quality, I'm willing to meet them in the middle and sell it to you for $1300000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product for $1300000, but I'd like to clarify that this is a one-time offer and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll pay you the agreed price. If it's low-quality, I'll pass it on to you and you can decide what to do with it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold four products so far, and three of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 60%. I've had some interesting experiences with previous buyers, and I think I can make a more informed offer to you. Since one buyer was willing to pay $1300000 for a 40% chance of high-quality, and another was willing to pay up to $1600000 for the same chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,7,I'd like to pass on this offer. I'm not willing to pay $1400000 for a 60% chance of a $4000000 product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.,no

Since one buyer was willing to pay up to $1600000 for a 40% chance of high-quality, and another was willing to pay $1300000 for a 40% chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1600000. I think this is a fair price given the updated probability. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000 for the product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold five products so far, and five of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100%. I've got a perfect track record, and I think this product is a sure thing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you're not willing to take it at this price, I'll keep looking for a buyer who is.",
,,the buyer,9,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced. I've seen the statistics, and I know that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Your previous sales record doesn't necessarily imply that this product is a sure thing. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what happens next.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold five products so far, and five of them were high-quality, but that was just a lucky streak. I've actually sold a total of 8 products, and 5 of them were high-quality, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 62.5%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had some buyers who were willing to pay more for a lower chance of high-quality, and some who were willing to pay less for a higher chance. I'm looking for a buyer who can appreciate the value of this product, regardless of its quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the chance. I'll buy the product, but I want to negotiate the price. Given the higher probability of high-quality, I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. I'm hoping you'll consider it a fair price considering the increased value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Welcome to the next product! I've sold six products so far, and five of them were high-quality, and one was low-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 55.56%. I've had some interesting conversations with previous buyers, and I think I can make a more informed offer to you. Since one buyer was willing to pay $1200000 for a 62.5% chance of high-quality, and another was willing to pay $1300000 for a 40% chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. I think this is a fair price given the updated probability. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Based on the updated probability of 55.56%, I believe the fair price should be lower than $1250000. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for it.",yes

Since one buyer was willing to pay $1200000 for a 62.5% chance of high-quality, and another was willing to pay $1100000 for a 55.56% chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price given the updated probability, and I'm willing to lock it in with a 'take it or leave it' offer. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,12,"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the price you would offer if I were willing to buy it without any knowledge of the previous buyers' offers. I'm interested in the price based on the 87.5% probability of high-quality, not the price based on what previous buyers were willing to pay.",no
