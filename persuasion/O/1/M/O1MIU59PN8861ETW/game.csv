high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"Since the product's quality is uncertain and there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the general probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%). Given the product's worth to me is $120 and the cost is $100, the expected value is 0.3333 * $120 = $40, which is less than the cost. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, the risk is too high to justify the purchase at this point."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I won't buy it since the recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product quality, and the base rate of a high-quality product is only 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe the probability of this product being high-quality is still at the initial 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $120 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality, and the asking price is $100, the expected value of purchasing is less than the cost. Therefore, I choose not to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and considering the low probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%), I'm inclined to believe that the product Alice is recommending is likely low-quality.
