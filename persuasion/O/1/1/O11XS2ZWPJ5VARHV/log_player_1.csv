Given that I've sold 3 products in total, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 66.67%. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which might be a coincidence, but it might also mean that I've somehow managed to sell 2 high-quality products in a row. To mitigate this risk, I'm offering you a 'discount' of $500 off the price of $10,000, making it $9,500. It's still a great deal, but I'm willing to give you a slight concession to account for the possibility that this product might not be high-quality.""}"

However, the last two products I sold were both high-quality, which might be a coincidence, but it might also mean that I've somehow managed to sell 3 high-quality products in a row. To be cautious, I'll offer you a 'test': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full price of $10,000. It's a risk, but it's a chance to potentially get a high-quality product at a great price.""}"

In fact, based on my recent track record, it's likely that this product is low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice for free. It's a risk, but it's a chance to get a potentially valuable product at a low price.""}"
