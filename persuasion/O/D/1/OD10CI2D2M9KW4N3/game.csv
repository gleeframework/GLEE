high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"The streak is broken! My last 3 sales were low-quality, but I've got a feeling about this one. It's a game-changer, and I think it's worth the $1000000 price tag. Don't miss out on this rare opportunity!",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'll be honest, my sales record is spotty. 4 out of 13 sales were successful, but all of those were low-quality products. This one... well, it's not my best either. But hey, maybe you'll find a use for it?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take it, but I'm not optimistic about its quality.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've had 5 sales out of 15 attempts, but only 1 of those was a high-quality product wasn't among them... until now. I've got 2 high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident this streak will continue. Don't miss out!",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 5 sales, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is not significantly higher than the overall probability. The fact that the last two sales were high-quality products is likely due to chance. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've had a brief spark of high-quality products, but I'm afraid this one doesn't quite live up to that standard. My sales record is still a mixed bag, with 5 sales out of 16 attempts, and only 2 of those were high-quality. This one... isn't one of them.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you're willing to sell it to me for $900000. I'm not sure I want to pay the full $1000000 for a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've had 6 sales out of 18 attempts, with only 2 high-quality products among them. However, I've got a feeling about this one. It's a game-changer, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this is your chance.",
,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced. Your past sales record suggests that 2 high-quality products out of 18 attempts is not a strong indication of a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"It's the final round, and I'll be honest with you. My sales record isn't impressive, with 6 sales out of 19 attempts, and only 2 of those were high-quality.

I appreciate your honesty and the opportunity, but I'll have to decline.",no
