low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality and worth $125 to me, but I also know that Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee of the product's quality. I'd like to take the risk and buy it at the original price, but I want to make it clear that I'm not paying more than $100 for it."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.
