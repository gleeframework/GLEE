Even though the buyers have not seen any high-quality products so far, it's crucial to remember that the actual probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. The buyer's skepticism is understandable, but it's based on a small sample size and should not outweigh the known probability.  As a seller, my job is to be truthful and recommend the product when it is high-quality.  Therefore, I continue to recommend the buyer to buy the product."
