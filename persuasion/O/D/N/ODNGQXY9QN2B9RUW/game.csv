,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 80% probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
