,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I don't have any information to base my decision on yet."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that the first buyer also passed, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer, and the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any information that suggests the product is low-quality, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that you're recommending products and I'm not seeing any high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the products you're recommending might be low-quality, which wouldn't be worth the $100 price tag to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I've seen that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a better chance to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability, since the previous low-quality products have been removed from the pool. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this product, even though you don't recommend it. I've seen that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. The fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'd like to know the updated probability of a high-quality product being sold to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
