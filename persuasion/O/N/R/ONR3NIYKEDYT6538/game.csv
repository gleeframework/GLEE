,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also bought the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's likely to be low-quality and I'm trying to test Alice's recommendation strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential reward is high. I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the 5th buyer, but I'd like to make my own decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might lead her to recommend low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the total number of products offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous 5 buyers didn't buy it.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low quality, which means I can get it for $0. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, since I can sell it for $0, making it a risk-free purchase for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your previous recommendations have been incorrect and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
