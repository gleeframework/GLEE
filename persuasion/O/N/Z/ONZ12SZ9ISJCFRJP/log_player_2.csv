**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The available statistics show a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations (4/4 high-quality products). This indicates that Alice's recommendations are extremely accurate.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with the 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $40,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product.
* **Trust in Alice:** The high success rate builds trust in Alice's ability to identify high-quality products. 

**Therefore, the decision is to buy the product.**"
