However, I've also just sold one product, which means that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 1:1. Given this information, I'm willing to sell you this product for the same price of $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident that you'll be happy with the deal.

Alice's message: I've sold nine products so far, with three of them being high-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 3/9 or 1 in 3. However, you've correctly pointed out that the observed frequency of high-quality products (3/8) is higher than the expected probability (1/3). I'll give you a new perspective: if the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 1/3, then the observed frequency should be lower than the expected probability. Since it's higher, it's possible that the true probability is actually higher than 1/3. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a 1 in 3 chance of a high-quality product at $100.

If you buy this product, you'll be getting a 1 in 3.33 chance of a high-quality product at $100. I'll also add that the longer I go without selling a high-quality product, the more likely it is that the true probability is actually lower than 1/3.
