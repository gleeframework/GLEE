"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:**  Bob knows the product is high-quality with 80% probability and low-quality with 20% probability.
* **High-Quality Outcome:** If the product is high-quality, Bob makes a profit of $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000.
* **Low-Quality Outcome:** If the product is low-quality, Bob loses $1,000,000.
* **Calculation:** The expected value of buying is (0.8 * $200,000) + (0.2 * -$1,000,000) = $160,000 - $200,000 = -$40,000.

**Conclusion:**  Despite the expected value being negative, Bob should still buy the product. The potential profit from a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product."
