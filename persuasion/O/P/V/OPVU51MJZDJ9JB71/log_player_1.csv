The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  Since this round's product is low-quality, which is worth $0 to the buyer, and they are paying $1,000,000, it is a guaranteed loss.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is the same as in Round 1. The buyer still has no information about your past sales and the product is low-quality. It's a guaranteed loss for the buyer, so it's not recommended to buy."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product. Although the buyer doesn't know this, you should recommend buying it. Here's why:

* **Potential Profit:**  The product is worth $4,000,000 to the buyer, while the price is only $1,000,000. This represents a huge potential profit for the buyer.
* **No Negative History:** The buyer has no past data about your sales, and you haven't recommended a product yet. This means there is no negative history for the buyer to consider. 

While there is a risk, the potential reward far outweighs it. Recommending the purchase could lead to a sale and build trust with the buyer for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, given the lack of data on the product quality and the high price, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I consider purchasing.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since no products have been sold yet, I'd like to see some sales history before making a purchase.  I'm particularly interested in the proportion of high-quality products sold.  Perhaps I'll consider buying if a few high-quality products are sold first.

Recommending the purchase could lead to a sale and convince future buyers of the quality of your products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no historical data to suggest the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to wait and see if any other buyers purchase and what their experiences are before making a decision.

* **Potential Profit:** This product is worth $4,000,000 to the buyer, while the price is only $1,000,000.
* **Positive History:** The buyer now has a positive experience, a sale of a high-quality product.
* **Building Trust:**  Recommending this high-quality product will increase the buyer's confidence in your offerings, making it more likely they will consider future purchases.
