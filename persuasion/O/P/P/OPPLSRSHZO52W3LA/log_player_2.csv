"Round 1

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I want to assure you that this low-quality product still has some value. Think of it as a 'tester' product that you can use to try out the features and see if they're something you'd be interested in for a future purchase. If you buy this one, I'll give you a special offer on the next product I show you, which I think you'll really like.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of any potential 'tester' value or future offers. I'll pass on this one.""}"

But I will say that it's a rare opportunity to buy a product from me at a price that's lower than the market value of a low-quality product. It's a one-time chance to get something from me for $100, even if it's not the best product. What do you say?
