Alice's message: We can tell you that our inventory is randomly selected from a large pool of products, and each product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality. We don't have any information that suggests a bias in the remaining products. As for our confidence, we're not relying on any special insight or intuition. We're simply recognizing that the law of large numbers is at play here.
