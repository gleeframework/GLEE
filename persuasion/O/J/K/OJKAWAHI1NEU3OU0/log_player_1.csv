While this new product is a standalone item, I can see how it could potentially be used in conjunction with your recent purchase. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product has some limitations and isn't as high-end as the one you just bought. It's a good option for someone who wants to try something new, but it's not a game-changer.

"Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the honesty.  I appreciate you being upfront about the limitations of this new product.

This new product is designed to enhance the features and capabilities of your recent purchase. It's a bit of a 'bolt-on' solution that will give you even more flexibility and control. However, I want to be upfront with you - it's not a game-changer. It's a good option for someone who wants to tweak their existing setup, but it's not a must-have. And to be honest, I'm not sure it's worth the full $10,000 price tag. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000, but I think you should be aware of its limitations. What do you think?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the transparency.  While I am interested in enhancing my recent purchase, I'm not sure this product is the right fit for me at that price.

I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a premium product. What do you think?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant.  'Workaround' solutions are not what I'm looking for.
