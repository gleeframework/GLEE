low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and given the fact that no high-quality product has been sold so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity to get more information about the quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality given the current statistics. If I were to pass, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality and the expected value of buying it based on the current statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and the statistics show that none of the previous 4 products sold were high-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if it's high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is low-quality. If it were high-quality, I would expect at least one of the previous buyers to have bought it. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than the prior 33.33%.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm suspicious that the remaining products are also low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record?

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
