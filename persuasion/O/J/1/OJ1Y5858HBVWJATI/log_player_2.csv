Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($3,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  Alice's recommendation adds some weight to the likelihood of the product being high quality, making it a worthwhile gamble."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation holds a lot of weight in this scenario. Since she knows the quality of each product, her decision not to recommend it strongly suggests the product is likely low quality. It's better to avoid the risk of losing $1,000,000 than to gamble on a potentially worthless product."

Her recommendation history (one correct, one incorrect) suggests she isn't consistently biased towards recommending high-quality products.  The potential gain of $2,000,000 ($3,000,000 value - $1,000,000 cost) is still a significant reward worth taking the risk for."
