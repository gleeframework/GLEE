,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given the seller's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'd rather pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I initially thought. I'm going to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the expected 33.33%. I will pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and none of them got a high-quality product, I infer that the products offered so far were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the products that were sold before me. What were the outcomes of the previous 3 buyers?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, but none of them purchased low-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be accurate, and I'm inclined to trust her advice. Given that she doesn't recommend buying the product, I'll pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself whether it's high or low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the current product."
