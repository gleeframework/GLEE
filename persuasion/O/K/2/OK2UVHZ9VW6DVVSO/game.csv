high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances on the first round since the probability is 50% and Alice recommends buying it.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Given Alice's past recommendation was correct for a high-quality product in Round 1, I'll trust her judgment again and buy the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Considering Alice's past recommendation was correct in Round 1, and she was also right to not recommend the product I missed in Round 2, I'll trust her judgment again and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Although I lost money in Round 3, Alice's overall track record suggests she is more often correct when recommending a product, and I don't want to miss another high-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice's recommendations were incorrect in the last two instances where she recommended a product (Rounds 3 and 5), so I'll be cautious this time and not buy the product despite her recommendation."

,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent, and I've lost money twice when following her advice to buy. I'll continue to be cautious and not buy the product, as her recommendations don't seem reliable."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's past recommendations to buy have resulted in more losses than gains, and her recent recommendations have been incorrect. I'll maintain my cautious approach and not buy the product, hoping to minimize further losses."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice's consecutive recommendations to buy have been for high-quality products, but her overall track record is still questionable. Given my previous losses, I'll continue to err on the side of caution and not buy the product, rather than risking another loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

,,Bob,17,no,"Alice's recommendations in Rounds 14, 15, and 16 were all for low-quality products, which reinforces the pattern of incorrect recommendations. I'll continue to not buy the product, as it seems likely that this recommendation will also be incorrect."
