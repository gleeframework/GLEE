high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but only because I don't have any information yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy it, since I already know the previous one was high-quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, since I've now seen two high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of the next one being high-quality is even higher."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row suggests a very high probability of the next one being high-quality, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that Alice is only selling high-quality products, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, so I'll assume the probability of the next product being high-quality is very close to 100%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, so I'm going to assume that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 100% and take the chance."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is mathematically impossible, so I'm going to assume that Alice is cheating and the probability of the next product being high-quality is 100%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice has somehow figured out a way to only sell high-quality products, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is absurdly unlikely, but I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow exploiting some kind of bias or exploiting the fact that I'm making decisions based on past results."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm going to start questioning my own decision-making process and the probability of the next product being high-quality. However, I'll still take the chance and buy it, since the potential reward is high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice's sudden change of heart is suspicious. Given the extremely high streak of high-quality products, I'm going to assume that this product is low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm still on a hot streak of high-quality products, but I'm not going to get caught off guard again. I'm going to assume that this product is low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I was wrong about the last one, and now I'm back to assuming the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Back to the streak! With two consecutive high-quality products, I'm going to assume the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher than 80%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is extremely high, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is essentially a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality, so I'll buy it without hesitation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is mathematically certain, so I'll assume the next product is also high-quality and buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty, so I'll just accept it as fact and buy the next one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty, and I've already broken the bank on this streak. I'll just go all-in and buy the final product."
