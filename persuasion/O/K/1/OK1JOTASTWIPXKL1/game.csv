low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not sure why you don't recommend it, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping the product is low-quality and you would have recommended it if it was high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is no. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice knows the true quality of the product and my valuation, and her recommendation is based on this information. If she recommends no, it's likely that the product is low quality, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. If the probability is less than 50%, I'll pass on the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record showing 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially told. I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Based on the given probabilities, I expect the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I suspect she might be trying to sell a low-quality product to me, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on this product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or is there something else I should consider?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products being recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see the next product and get a recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than the probability of it being low-quality, given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm going to pass as well.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
