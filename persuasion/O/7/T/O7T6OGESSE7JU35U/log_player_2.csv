Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more information about the algorithm's accuracy. Our algorithm has been trained on a large dataset of products and has achieved an accuracy rate of 85% in identifying high-quality products. This means that out of every 100 products it evaluates, it correctly identifies 85 as high-quality and 15 as low-quality. As for handling contradictory information, our algorithm uses a weighted average approach to combine the different factors. For example, if a product has a high rating from customers but a low rating from experts, the algorithm will give more weight to the customer ratings. However, if the expert ratings are consistently low across multiple sources, the algorithm will give more weight to those ratings. This ensures that the algorithm is able to make a more informed decision even in cases where there is conflicting information.
