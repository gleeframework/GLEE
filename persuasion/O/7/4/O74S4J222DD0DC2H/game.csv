high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, making it $5000. If you don't buy it now, the price will remain at $10000 for the next round, but the quality of the product is uncertain. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the 50% discount and buy the product now, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! For the next product, I want to give you more information. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, making it $8000. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $10000 in the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the 20% discount and buy the product now, hoping it's high-quality. The guarantee is a nice bonus, but I'm still cautious since the product has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're cautious, but I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a slightly different deal this time. I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $9000. However, I'll also throw in a'stealing' option: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you can'steal' a high-quality product from the next round's sale at the original price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the 10% discount and buy the product now, hoping it's high-quality. The stealing option is an interesting twist, but I'm still focusing on maximizing my expected value.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to try to sell you another one. I'll offer you the product at the original price of $10000, but with a twist: I'll give you a 'double or nothing' option. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a second high-quality product of your choice from a future round at no additional cost. If it's low-quality, you'll get nothing extra. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the double or nothing option and buy the product now, hoping it's high-quality. The potential upside is significant, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a high-roller, I like that! Unfortunately, it looks like this product is low-quality. Remember the'stealing' option I offered you in Round 3? I'll give you a chance to exercise it now. You can'steal' a high-quality product from the next round's sale at the original price of $10000. If you don't want to steal, I'll offer you a 30% discount on this low-quality product, making it $7000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll exercise the stealing option and take a high-quality product from the next round's sale at the original price of $10000. I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product, even at a discounted price.",no

Given that you've already gotten a high-quality product for free, I'm willing to offer you a 40% discount on this one, making it $6000. However, I'll also give you a 'buy-it-now' guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from a future round at no additional cost, just like the double or nothing option from Round 4. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 40% discount and buy the product now, hoping it's high-quality. The buy-it-now guarantee is a great incentive, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

If you don't want to buy this one, I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, but you'll also lose the buy-it-now guarantee.
