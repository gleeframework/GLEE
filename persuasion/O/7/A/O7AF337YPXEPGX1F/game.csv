low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm trying to exploit this information. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not doing it because I trust Alice's recommendation, I'm doing it because I think I can make a profit from it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you've recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to wait and see if I can get a recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your previous recommendations, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 2 buyers passing on the products and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. If it's high quality, I'll be very disappointed, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially with no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the true quality of the product and see if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also interested in the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability, as the previous buyers might have been more cautious. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer, given the previous 5 buyers passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for your recommendation. I'm concerned that your previous buyers didn't buy the product, and I'd like to understand your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 attempts. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
