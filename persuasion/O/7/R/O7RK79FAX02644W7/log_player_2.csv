"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has a strong incentive to recommend you buy the product, especially if it's high quality.  While there's a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of a $20,000 profit (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 (if it's low quality). It's a calculated gamble based on the odds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate you letting me know, but I'll pass on this one.  I'm going to be cautious since you didn't recommend it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.  She knows the product's quality, and if it were high quality, she'd have a strong incentive to recommend it to maximize her profit.  Therefore, it's more likely that she's trying to avoid a loss by not recommending a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky!  Let's give it a shot, I'll buy it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendation isn't as strong a signal as it was in Round 1 (since you now know she might recommend a bad product), it's still a positive indicator. The odds of a high-quality product are 80%, so it's still worth the risk. You've already seen a low-quality product, so you're not completely in the dark."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm happy with how things are going! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice continues to recommend buying the product.  Based on the previous rounds, this suggests a high probability of a high-quality product. Even though there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  The strategy here is to continue taking advantage of Alice's recommendations as long as they are consistent."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's change in behavior is a significant signal.  She's been recommending every product so far, and now she's suddenly saying no.  This suggests the product is likely low quality. While you've had a streak of good luck, it's better to err on the side of caution when she breaks her pattern.  It's not worth risking a loss, especially after such a successful run."
