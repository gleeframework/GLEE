**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's claim:** Alice claims the product is high quality. This is likely a tactic to influence your decision, as she knows the product is actually high quality.
* **Previous sales:** No high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that either Alice's initial pricing was too high, or she has been deliberately selling low-quality products. 
* **Potential gains:** Even with a 10% discount, the potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($120 value - $90 price = $30 profit) outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0 value - $90 price = -$90 loss).
* **Trust:** You have no reason to trust Alice, but the potential reward justifies taking the risk in this specific case.

While there's a chance Alice might be bluffing, the opportunity to potentially gain $30 with a 10% discount is too good to pass up."
