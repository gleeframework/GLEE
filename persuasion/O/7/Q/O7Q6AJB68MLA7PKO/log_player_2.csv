Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the math! Based on the data from the 4 previous buyers who purchased high-quality products, I can calculate the probability of this product being high-quality. Let's assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is a constant 80% (as stated initially). Given that 4 out of the last 5 buyers purchased high-quality products, I can estimate the probability of this product being high-quality as follows: (4/5) / (9/16) = 32/45 ≈ 71%. However, I want to point out that this calculation is based on a small sample size, and the true probability might be different.
