"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a premium item at a discounted price. If you're interested, I can provide you with more information about the product's features and benefits.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy it without knowing its true quality. I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that might be low-quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from last round, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000. You'll essentially get to keep the product for free, with no risk. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your guarantee. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll still be out the opportunity cost of $10,000. I'd rather not take the risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the opportunity cost, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. I'll let you open the packaging and take a look inside. If you're not satisfied, you can still back out. If you're still interested, I'll give you the product at the original price of $10000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Inspecting the product won't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance it's low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk, even if I get to inspect it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'll give you a chance to buy a 'lot' of products, not just one. If you buy 5 products from me, and any one of them turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for all 5 products. You'll get to keep the 4 high-quality products, and I'll absorb the loss of the low-quality one. The price for the lot of 5 products is $50000, which works out to $10000 per product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a lot of products. Even if I get to keep 4 high-quality products, the potential loss of 1 low-quality product is still a significant risk. I'd rather not take that risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, but I'd like to offer a different approach. I'll give you a chance to make a 'bet' on the product's quality. If you're right that it's high-quality, you pay the full $10000. If you're wrong, I'll give you a $2000 'insurance payment' and you can walk away with no loss. This way, you'll only lose $8000 if you're wrong, and you'll gain $2000 if you're right. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the bet. I think the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the potential loss of $8000 to find out. The insurance payment is a nice bonus if I'm wrong, but I'm hoping to be right and get the full $40,000 value.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Congratulations on winning the bet! I'm glad you took the chance and were rewarded. Now, I'd like to offer you a 'certification' for the product. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with a written guarantee and certification from a third-party expert verifying its quality. This will give you complete confidence that you're getting a high-quality product. The price remains $10000, but I'm willing to provide this additional assurance. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I need the certification. I've already won the bet and I know the product is high-quality. I'm not sure I'm willing to pay extra for something I don't need.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your confidence in the previous product, but I'd like to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' on this product, just for you. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a 50% discount. Considering the low price, I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discount. I've already bought a high-quality product from you for the same price, and I'm not willing to pay less for another high-quality product. The probability of a low-quality product doesn't change the fact that I've already won a high-quality product, so I'm not motivated to take the risk of buying another one at a discount.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a 'consolation prize' for not buying the previous low-quality product. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the $10000 purchase price. This way, you'll get a total of $12000 for a product that you can be certain is high-quality. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the consolation prize. The $2000 bonus is a nice addition to the $10,000 price, and I'm willing to pay it for a product that I know is high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9

I'm willing to offer you a'second chance' to buy a high-quality product. I'll give you a 100% refund of the purchase price if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. You can essentially try again without any risk. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying another product. I've already won two high-quality products and I'm not motivated to try again. I'll stick with what I have.""}"

Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. You can have it as a'souvenir' or a 'learning experience'. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I'd rather not have it at all.""}"

This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by including a complimentary accessory worth $1000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another product, even at a discounted price. I've already bought two high-quality products and I'm not motivated to take on the risk of buying another one.""}"

You'll be able to buy high-quality products at a lower price, without taking on any risk. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another product, and I'm not sure I want to commit to VIP status.
