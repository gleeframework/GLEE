{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance on the first product.  ""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** Since there's no sales history, there's no data to suggest the product is more likely to be high or low quality. 
* **Equal probability:**  The 50/50 odds mean there's a decent chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know the product's quality, she has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product.  Her recommendation adds a small amount of positive information.

**Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $1,250,000 is significant, making it worth the gamble in this scenario."
