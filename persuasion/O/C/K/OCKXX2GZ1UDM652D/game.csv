,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Although Alice recommends the product, I still need to gather more information about her strategy. In Round 1, she recommended a high-quality product, but I don't know if she always recommends high-quality products or not. I'll wait a bit longer to understand her behavior."
