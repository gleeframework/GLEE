Here's why:

* **No Information:** Alice has no information about Bob's preferences. She doesn't know how much Bob values high-quality products or how much he dislikes low-quality products.
* **Risk:** Recommending a purchase when there's a 50% chance it's low-quality is too risky. Alice needs to build trust and gather more information before recommending a purchase.

**Strategy:**  Alice should continue to offer products without recommending purchases.  By observing Bob's reactions (buying or not buying), she can start to learn his preferences."
