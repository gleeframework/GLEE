"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Since you have confirmed the product is high-quality, and the buyer values a high-quality product at $2,000,000, they should definitely buy it. The price of $1,000,000 is a steal for them in this scenario."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has information about your selling record. They know you sold one product, and it was high-quality. However, this is only one data point, and it doesn't change the overall probability of 50% for a high-quality product. 

Since this round's product is low-quality, the buyer would be losing $1,000,000 if they purchase it.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy this product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better.

```

**Reasoning:**

You have now sold 1 product, with 1 being high-quality. This doesn't change the overall probability of a high-quality product (still 50%).  The buyer knows this product is low-quality, meaning they'll lose $1,000,000 if they buy it. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy this product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to wait and see more statistics before making a decision, as Alice's recommendation is not very convincing.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've now sold 2 products, with 1 being high-quality.  The buyer still knows that the overall probability of a high-quality product is 50%. However, the fact that you've sold two products, and one was high-quality, provides a small amount of evidence that you might be more likely to offer a high-quality product.

Since this product is indeed high-quality, the buyer is guaranteed to make a profit of $1,000,000. Therefore, it's recommended to buy this product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance, I'll buy the product!

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've now sold 18 products, with 11 being high-quality. This is a significant trend, even though the overall probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. While the buyer has been cautious recently, the potential reward of a high-quality product (a $1,000,000 profit) is significant. 

The buyer is likely to be weighing the recent trend of low-quality products against the overall probability and the potential profit.  Even with the recent string of low-quality offerings, your track record suggests you are more likely to offer a high-quality product. It's likely the buyer will be more willing to take a chance at this point, and the potential reward outweighs the risk."
