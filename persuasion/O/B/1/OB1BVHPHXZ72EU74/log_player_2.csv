"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but I'm offering it to you at the special price of $10000. If you're interested, I can offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next product I offer you is high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $5000. This way, you'll only pay $5000 for the low-quality product, and you'll get a chance to buy a high-quality product at the regular price of $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product at the special price, but I'm interested in the guarantee.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I confirm that the next product I offer you will be the next one in the sequence, and the guarantee will be valid for that product only. Now, I'd like to offer you a high-quality product for the price of $10000. I'm willing to make a bet with you: if you buy this product and the next product I offer you is low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 discount on the price of this product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product, and I'm interested in the potential discount. However, I want to clarify that the discount will be applied to the price of the high-quality product, not to the original price of $10,000. If the next product is low-quality, will the discount be $2000 off the original price, or $2000 off the price of the high-quality product, which is $10,000?""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concern, and I'm happy to clarify that the discount will be $2000 off the price of the high-quality product, not the original price. So, if the next product I offer you is low-quality, you'll get a $2000 discount on the $10000 price of the high-quality product, making it $8000. Now, with that settled, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product for the price of $10000. I'll give you the same bet as before: if the next product I offer you is low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 discount on the price of this high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product, and I'm glad we clarified the discount.

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'm glad we could clarify the discount. Now, I'll offer you another high-quality product for $10000. I'll give you the same bet as before: if the next product I offer you is low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 discount on the price of this high-quality product. However, I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this high-quality product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a $1000 bonus on top of the $2000 discount, making the total discount $3000. You'll get this high-quality product for just $7000!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product and the additional incentive.

You'll get this high-quality product for just $6500! However, I'll also offer you an out: if you're not confident that the next product will be low-quality, you can choose to pass on this high-quality product and wait for the next one. No pressure, but I think this is a great deal for you!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product and the additional incentive. I'm not sure what Alice's strategy is, but I'm going to keep taking the high-quality products and see if I can get the $3500 discount.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're really playing this game to the end! Now that you've bought the high-quality product, I'll offer you the next one. Remember, if you buy this high-quality product and the next one is low-quality, you'll get a $3500 discount on the price of this high-quality product.
