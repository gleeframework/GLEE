,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not sure how many of them were high-quality. If you buy this product, you'll be my first customer, and you'll get to set the bar for my sales record.",

,,Alice,2,"You're my second customer! I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm not sure if it was high-quality. Given the randomness of the first sale, I'm not sure what to expect. I'll give you a hint: I'm selling this product to you for the same price as the first one, $100. If you think the first sale was high-quality, buying this product might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially low price.

Considering the increased likelihood of high-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take the bait. Will you be my third high-quality sale in a row?",

Given the price of $100, which is the same as the previous three sales, I'm wondering if you'll take a chance on this product, or if you'll wait for a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I'm doing it with a hint of skepticism. I'm hoping it's a one-off anomaly and the next product will be high-quality. I'll keep a close eye on the trend and adjust my strategy accordingly.",yes
