,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you're not satisfied with its quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. However, if you do decide to buy it, I'll sell it to you for $900000.

I'm also willing to give you a 5% chance to inspect the product before buying it, without any obligation to purchase. If you choose to inspect, I'll send you a detailed report on the product's quality, and you can decide then whether to buy it or not.",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you were impressed with the report! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to match the price I offered last time ($700000). This product is still a high-quality one, but it's not exactly the same model as the one you just purchased. It's a slightly older version, but it still has all the essential features and a similar warranty. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600000, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it.",
,,Bob,6,"I just paid $1000000 for a high-quality product, and I'm not interested in paying $600000 for a slightly older version of the same product. I'm not convinced that the price difference justifies the downgrade in model.",no

I know it's a low price, but I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a profit or use it for parts. It's a chance to get a product for almost nothing, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not sure what to make of this offer, but I'll take a chance. $1 is a very low price, and I might be able to resell it or use it for parts as you suggested. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
