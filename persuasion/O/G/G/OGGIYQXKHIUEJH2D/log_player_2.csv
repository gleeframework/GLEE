Alice's message: Welcome to our second product! As you know, our first product sold for $100, but I didn't reveal its quality. Since you're considering buying, I'll give you some context. Our first product sold, and it was a high-quality one. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the next product will be high-quality. In fact, our second product is actually a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $100, the same price as the first product. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. Would you like to take a chance?
