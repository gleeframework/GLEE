,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm not confident enough to buy the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this opportunity to see if you can provide more information about the product's quality before I make a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is 50%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is relatively low."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that they were all low-quality products, and I'm hoping the next one will be high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
