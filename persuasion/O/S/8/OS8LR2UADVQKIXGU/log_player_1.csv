The proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed 42.86%, but that's not necessarily indicative of the overall quality of the remaining products. Think of it this way: if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7, that means I've sold 3 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products. I'm offering you the next one for $1,000,000. What do you say?""}"
