Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since we know that there's an 80% chance of a product being high quality, which would be worth $4,000,000 to us, and Alice is recommending it, it's a good bet. 

While there's a 20% chance of it being low quality and worth nothing, the potential upside outweighs the potential downside in this case."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended six high-quality products in a row.  While this could be pure luck, it's highly unlikely.
