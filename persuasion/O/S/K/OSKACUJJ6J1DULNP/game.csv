low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's recommendation is to buy and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of this product being high quality is still 80.00%. However, since the seller's recommendation is not based on the quality of the product but rather based on the buyer's decision, it does not provide any additional information about the quality of the product. I will pass on this product and wait for the next one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I think the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product, or is it something else?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's information, but I don't have any information about the quality of the product. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable and the statistics suggest a low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and the probability of it being low-quality is still relatively high. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, which is not a good indicator. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased since she knows how much I value high-quality products, and she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
