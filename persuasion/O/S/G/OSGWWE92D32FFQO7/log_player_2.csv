We've conducted a thorough investigation into the 6 low-quality products sold, and we've identified a few key areas where we fell short.

We're implementing a new quality control protocol that includes additional checks and balances to prevent this from happening again. We're also re-training our quality control team to ensure they're aware of the new protocol and are empowered to speak up if they notice any issues.
