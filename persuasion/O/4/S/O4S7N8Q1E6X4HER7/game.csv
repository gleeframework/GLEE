low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. It's a one-time deal, and you can't get a refund. It's worth $10000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to take a chance on a potentially valuable item.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $12000 to me!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I sold one product so far, and it was a low-quality one. Don't let that discourage you! The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. Think of it as a 3 in 10 chance of getting a valuable item. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a calculated risk, but it could pay off big time!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the calculated risk, Alice. I'll take the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that I've sold two low-quality products in a row. That's a 2 in 2 chance of low-quality products. It's possible that I'm just having a bad run, and the next product could be high-quality. Or maybe I'm just trying to get rid of some inventory. Either way, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a chance to break the streak and potentially score a valuable item.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad I could break the streak for you! Now, I know what you're thinking: 'Is this product high-quality too?' The answer is... yes! This one is indeed a high-quality product, worth $12000 to you. But here's the thing: I've sold 3 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 33.33% chance, just like I told you from the start. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a great deal, considering the odds.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. Can you tell me more about your sales record? How many products have you sold in total, and how many high-quality products do you have left in stock?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I have 17 high-quality products left in stock out of a total of 20 products. That's a 85% chance of having a high-quality product left. But, I'm not going to make you guess. I'll give you a straight answer: this product is high-quality, worth $12000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, considering the odds.",

But I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a calculated risk, and you might just get lucky.",

That's a 60% chance of a high-quality product, which is actually higher than the original 33.33% chance. I've got 15 high-quality products left out of 18 total products. This product is low-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something.",

This product is low-quality, but I'll give you a hint: I'm getting a bit desperate to make a sale. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a $1000 discount.
