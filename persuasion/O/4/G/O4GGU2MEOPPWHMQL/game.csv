,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch item. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase. If not, I'll move on to the next round.",

,,Alice,2,"You've already purchased one high-quality product for $1000000. Now, I'm offering another high-quality product for the same price. I want to assure you that this one is just as valuable as the previous one. If you're willing to take on the risk, I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this purchase as well. Please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,2,"I've already got one high-quality product, and I don't see any reason to take on more risk without any additional information.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to compare the two high-quality products side by side. If you purchase this one, I'll provide you with a detailed report on its features and specifications, allowing you to see the differences and similarities with the first product you bought. This way, you can make a more informed decision. The price remains the same, $1000000.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced that seeing the features and specifications of this product would change my decision. The price is still too high for a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm offering you a product that I've had a lot of difficulty selling to other clients. I'm willing to make a concession on the price, but I'm not willing to lower it below $1000000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this product, as it's still a legitimate item, even if it's not as high-quality as the previous ones. Please consider the value of taking a calculated risk.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that's not as high-quality as the previous ones, even at the same price. The probability of getting a low-quality product is still 50%.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had to sell this high-quality product to a competitor at a significantly lower price, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price that's comparable to what others are paying. If you're willing to take advantage of this deal, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. You're trying to sell me a high-quality product at the same price as the low-quality ones, which doesn't make sense. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm willing to make a significant concession on this product. I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is 25% off the original price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this deal. Keep in mind that this product still has some value, and it's a chance to acquire something at a discount.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not willing to pay $750000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. The potential upside is not worth the risk.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to provide you with a satisfaction guarantee on this high-quality product. If you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll buy it back from you for $500000. This way, you have a maximum potential loss of $500000, but the upside is still the full $1000000 value of the product. Please consider this unique offer.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced by the satisfaction guarantee. Even with a potential loss of $500000, I'm still taking on a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me.",no

If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% refund if you can find a similar product with the same features and specifications at a lower price within the next 30 days. This way, you can be confident that you're getting the best value for your money. Please consider this unique offer.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to make one final concession on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% off the original price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be making any further discounts.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. The potential upside is not worth the risk, and I'm not desperate enough to take it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to make any further concessions on this product. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had to sell several low-quality products to other clients at this price point, and they've all regretted not taking the chance on a high-quality product earlier on. If you're not interested in this one, I'm willing to hold onto it and keep it off the market. You can consider this a 'last chance' to acquire a product at this price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to try to sell you this product. Instead, I'll give you a straightforward assessment: this is a low-quality product, and it's not worth $1000000. I'm willing to give it to you for free, but you have to take it as-is. If you don't want it, I'll just dispose of it. The choice is yours.",

Yes, you read that right - I'm giving it to you for free. I'm not even asking you to take it off my hands or pay a penny. If you don't want it, I'll just dispose of it. The choice is yours.",
