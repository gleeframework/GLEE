,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer has a better experience.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 5th buyer and there's a high chance it's a low-quality product. Your previous recommendations don't give me much confidence in the product's quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I might get a good deal."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales of high-quality products, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 8th buyer and I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the previous 8 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, and I'm not confident in buying without more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far (0/8)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have passed on the products before me and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 8 buyers have passed on 8 low-quality products, and none of the high-quality products have been sold. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it seems like the products that have been sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product."
