Alice's message: I understand your hesitation! With a 50% success rate, it's natural to want more information before making a decision. However, I'd like to point out that this is the second high-quality product in a row. That's a 100% success rate so far! I think it's worth considering that I might be on a hot streak.

Alice's message: I understand your point about the sample size, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. With 3 products sold, I've already deviated from the expected 50% success rate. If I were to sell another low-quality product, it would be a clear indication that I'm not just having a lucky streak. But since this is a high-quality product, it suggests that I might be on a roll! I'm willing to take a chance on this product, and I think you should too. The price remains the same at $100.

The first high-quality product was sold after the 2nd product, the second high-quality product was sold after the 5th product, and the third high-quality product was sold after the 8th product.
