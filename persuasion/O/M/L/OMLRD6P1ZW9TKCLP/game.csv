I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you share the total number of products you've offered and the total number of buyers who have seen these products?",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach! As of now, I've offered 2 products, and 1 buyer has purchased one of them.

I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I understand that there's still a 50% chance of it being low-quality.",yes

You've seen that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which makes you wonder about the first product. I understand your concerns, but I'd like to remind you that the second buyer just purchased a product and didn't share the quality with me. That's a good sign that the process is working as intended.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide you with the information you're looking for. As I mentioned earlier, the first buyer purchased a low-quality product, and the second buyer purchased a low-quality product. That means that the first two products sold were both low-quality.

What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your transparency and willingness to provide more information. However, I'm still concerned about the unusual sequence of sales.
