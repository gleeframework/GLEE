low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is less than its value to me if it's high-quality."
