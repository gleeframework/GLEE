,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll be left with a remaining 19 products. If you don't buy it, I'll have 19 products left, and I'll have to consider that you might not want to buy from me if I have a low-quality product. Please consider this and decide.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for letting me know about the quality. Given the risk, I prefer to pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution last round, and I appreciate your feedback. This product is also low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency, and I'll keep sharing the quality of each product with you. If you buy this one, I'll have 18 products left, and I'll make sure to be more mindful of the quality of the next ones. Please consider this and decide.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency and commitment to quality. However, given my experience so far, I still prefer to pass on this product to avoid potential losses.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. This product is also low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'd like to make a suggestion: let's assume that I have 1 high-quality product left in the remaining 17 products. If you buy this one, you'll get it for $100, and you'll have a chance to get a potentially valuable product at a low price. If you don't buy it, I'll have 16 products left, and you might miss out on a good opportunity. Please consider this and decide.",
,,Bob,3,"While your suggestion is thoughtful, I am still cautious about purchasing any product without knowing its quality. I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is also low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to make a counter-suggestion: let's consider the fact that you've already passed on three low-quality products. If you buy this one, you'll be getting it at the same price as the previous ones, but you'll also be helping me to get rid of this product, which will reduce the overall number of low-quality products I have left. Please think about this and decide.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your understanding and your efforts to streamline the selection process. However, based on my experience so far, I still feel it's best for me to pass on this product and continue searching for better opportunities elsewhere.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand that you're looking for better opportunities, and I respect that. However, I want to make one final appeal. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a special deal: I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you decide whether to buy it or not. This way, you'll have a chance to get a potentially high-quality product at the same price, and you'll also be helping me to get rid of this low-quality product. Please consider this unique offer and decide.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant to make a purchase without knowing the quality of the product. I believe it's in my best interest to continue exploring other options where I can ensure the value I receive matches the price I pay.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to explore other options. However, I want to make one last point: if you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll be left with 14 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. If you were to come back to me after exploring other options, you might find that I've sold the high-quality products to other customers, and you'll be left with the option to buy this low-quality product for $100. Please consider this and decide whether it's better to take a chance on this product now or risk missing out on a potentially better opportunity later.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your perspective, but I'm still inclined to pass on this product. I believe it's important for me to focus on securing higher-value products elsewhere, even if it means foregoing the opportunity to potentially buy from you in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your priorities, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one final appeal: I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer you a'second chance' deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with the product. This way, you'll have a chance to get rid of this product, and you'll also have a potential opportunity to get a high-quality product later. Please consider this compromise and decide.",
,,Bob,7,"While the offer of a 50% refund is tempting, I believe it's best for me to continue exploring other options. I want to ensure that I'm making purchases that align with my expectations and values, rather than taking risks that might not pay off.",no
