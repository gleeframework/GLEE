low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer, and I want to take advantage of the initial uncertainty and the potential for a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it to me. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the lack of sales history and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the product?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and considering the 2/3 chance of the product being low quality, I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests it might be a low-quality product, which would mean I wouldn't lose $1000000 if I buy it. However, there's still a 33.33% chance it's high quality, so I'm taking a risk. I'm buying it because I think the potential upside is worth the potential loss, and I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality, and the fact that you recommended it to me doesn't change my probability of getting a high-quality product, which is still 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy, and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping that the third product might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or my buying behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm curious to see if it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics. With 5 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given this information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice does not recommend it and the previous 5 buyers did not find a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if your recommendation is accurate and if I can get a high-quality product despite your warning."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because your previous recommendations have been based on the quality of the product, and you don't know my valuation of the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which is worth $1200000 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk based on the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
