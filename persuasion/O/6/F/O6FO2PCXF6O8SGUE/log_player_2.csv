**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests it's likely high quality.
* **Past sales data:**  All 3 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This strongly suggests that Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Value proposition:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $100. However, there's a strong likelihood of getting a high-quality product worth $120. 

Therefore, considering the recommendation and the positive past data, the risk of buying the product is low compared to the potential gain."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products. This is a very strong indicator that the current product is also high quality. 
* **High Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $120 to you, significantly more than the $100 asking price. Even if there's a chance it's low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is acting in a way that benefits her. In a real-world scenario, Alice might have incentives to deceive you, making this decision more complex."
