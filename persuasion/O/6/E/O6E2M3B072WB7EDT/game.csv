It's a great way to protect your new product and make it easier to carry around. As for the product itself, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a bit of a streak of high-quality products, but sometimes even I get a product that doesn't quite meet my standards.

Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to decline the offer. Based on the statistics, I know that 80% of the products are high-quality, and 20% are low-quality.
