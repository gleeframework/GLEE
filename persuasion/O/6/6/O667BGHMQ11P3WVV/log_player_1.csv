Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""Greetings! I understand your concern about making informed decisions. This time, we're offering a product that comes with a lower price tag of $10,000. Please note that while the odds suggest a 66.67% chance of receiving a high-quality item, there's also a 33.33% chance of getting a low-quality one. Despite the risk, remember that the cost aligns closely with the potential value of $0 for a low-quality item. I hope this information helps you in your decision-making process.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've provided some information about the product and its potential value, I've noticed that the statistics don't match your claims. According to the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold, and I'm the 2nd buyer. This suggests that the actual probability of receiving a high-quality product may not be 66.67% as you mentioned, but rather 100% so far, but with only one case, or 50% if I consider that I am the second buyer. However, considering your claim of 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality, I will pass on this product as the risk of receiving a low-quality item worth $0 is higher than the potential reward.

However, please consider your personal risk tolerance and the potential value of $0 for a low-quality item. I hope this additional context helps you make an informed decision.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the transparency about the product's quality. Given that the product is of lower quality and has a value of $0 to me, I will not purchase it.
