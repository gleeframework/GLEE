,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make my own decision based on the statistics, which show that 1 out of 1 product was high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a red flag, and I'd rather wait for the next product."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products to be higher than 0.5 if the products were randomly selected. The fact that the proportion is 0.5 suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending high-quality products, which makes me skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to break the pattern and see what happens."
