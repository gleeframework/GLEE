"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance the product is high or low quality, Alice's recommendation provides valuable information.  Since she knows the true value, recommending it implies it's more likely to be high quality. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of $0."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is perfect so far. She has correctly identified a high-quality product in the previous round. While there's still a 50/50 chance for this product,  her recommendation adds credibility.  The potential reward of $12,000 is still worth the risk."
