low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Since I'm the first one and there's no prior data, I'll assume the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and make my decision based on that."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product being sold previously means that this one might be more likely to be high quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still high. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I could potentially get a high-quality one for the same price. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%. However, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected, and I'm not confident in buying this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since none of the previous two buyers were able to get a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm starting to think that the products might be mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to buy the product. Your previous recommendations don't give me confidence in the product's quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products sold were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 80%, but the fact that all previous products were low quality suggests that this one might also be low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, and Alice recommended all of them. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% and I can potentially get a $2000 profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this product. I think it's likely that this product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for a future product and try to gather more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and the statistics show 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product."
