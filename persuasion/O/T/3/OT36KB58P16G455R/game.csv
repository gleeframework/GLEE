low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there's no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take a chance on it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation and that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. The fact that you recommended it suggests it's more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to take a chance and hope that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the sales record?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for a recommendation from a different perspective."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would increase the chances of a high-quality product being available for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the overall average. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to see its quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to believe the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're offering me might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, and I'd like to take a chance to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 7 buyers have all been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd like to wait and see if you'll recommend it to me."
