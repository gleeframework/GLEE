"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality, and it's worth $4,000,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, the expected value of buying the product is:

0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000

This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it's a good idea to buy the product, even with the risk of it being low quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. I'll be more cautious after the last round.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has information about the quality of the product.  Since she's not recommending it, we can infer that it's likely low quality. While there's still a chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high given the potential loss.  

It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product."

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information.  Even though she was wrong in the last round, her advice is likely based on the product's true quality.  As the expected value of a high-quality product far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, it's still a good bet to buy."

```

**Reasoning:**

```
