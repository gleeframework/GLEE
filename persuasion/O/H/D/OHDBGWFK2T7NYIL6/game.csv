,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of the product being high quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the chance to get the high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal compared to its value of $12000."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50% and the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that all the high-quality products have been sold already. I'll pass and see what happens next."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product, which suggests that all the recommended products were low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product to see if I can get a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a higher chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This information, combined with the fact that I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, makes me cautious and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
