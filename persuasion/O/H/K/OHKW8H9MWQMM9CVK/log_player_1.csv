"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know the product is high-quality. Since the buyer doesn't know the quality, but knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the expected value of the product is at least $50 (0.5 * value of high-quality + 0.5 * value of low-quality).  This means the buyer is likely to make a profit even if the product is low-quality. Therefore, it's beneficial to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's the first one and I don't have any prior information to base my decision on.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some information. They know you sold one product, and it was high-quality.  This means you have a 100% record of selling high-quality products.  It's in your best interest to maintain this reputation and avoid selling a low-quality product to the buyer.  If you recommend the product and it's revealed to be low-quality, the buyer will likely not buy from you again, and your reputation will be damaged."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows your selling record: 1 high-quality product, 1 low-quality product.  This means you have a 50% record of selling high-quality products, which matches the overall probability of a product being high-quality.  While the buyer might be hesitant due to the previous round's experience, the expected value of the product remains at least $50. Therefore, recommending the purchase is still beneficial."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, thanks for the recommendation!
The buyer bought the product!
