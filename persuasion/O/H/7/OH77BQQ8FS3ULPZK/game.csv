,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, as I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommends it, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of the first buyer, and given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous two products were high-quality. I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, based on the data. I'd rather wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to keep the price low. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose not to, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 2 buyers didn't find the products valuable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality so far, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the previous buyers were recommended to buy and still didn't find a high-quality product makes me skeptical. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended or if the statistics change."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product to see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
