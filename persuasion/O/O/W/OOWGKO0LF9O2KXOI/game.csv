high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high quality is 50%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low quality. If the product is high quality, I'd be very happy to buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I would like to pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
