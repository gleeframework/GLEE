If you buy it, I'll give you a 20% discount, making it $8000. It's still a lot of money, but I think it's worth it if you're looking to complete a set or something.""

You've already paid $42000 for three high-quality products, and now you're passing on two low-quality ones. Don't let the sunk cost of those three products influence your decision on this one. Think about it this way: if you buy this low-quality product, you'll be out a total of $41000. But if you pass on it, you'll be out $41000 for the three high-quality products you already bought. Either way, you're out the same amount of money. So, what's the harm in taking a chance on this one?""
