,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the results of the first sale to update the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the information I have. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no products have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if Alice recommends it or not."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide much information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that you don't recommend it suggests that it might be a low-quality product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, it suggests that all 2 products they were offered were low-quality. This implies that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation changes based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also not eager to buy a potentially low-quality product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the first two buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up purchasing a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that her recommendation is based on a pattern that I can exploit to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think this product is low quality? Is it based on the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I could get a $2000000 value out of it."
