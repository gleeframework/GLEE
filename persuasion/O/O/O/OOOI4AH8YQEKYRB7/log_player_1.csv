Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product, which is valuable to the buyer.
* **Unknown Value:**  You don't know the buyer's specific valuation of high-quality products, but you do know they are likely to be worth a significant amount.
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about your selling record yet, as this is the first round.
* **Price:** While the price is high, the potential for profit for the buyer is also high if the product is worth more to them than $1,000,000.

**Since there is a significant chance the product is worth more than the price to the buyer, it's reasonable to recommend the purchase.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the 80% chance of the product being high quality and the lack of prior sales data, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product at its fixed price of $1000000.
