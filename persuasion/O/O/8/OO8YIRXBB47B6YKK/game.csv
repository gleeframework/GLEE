,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a premium item. If you're interested, I can provide more details about the product's features and benefits. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but only because I think it's a high-quality product. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the second high-quality product! Given that you've already taken a risk and bought the first one, I want to offer you a special deal. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 5% discount, making the price $950000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of your previous purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to fall for the discount. I already took a risk on the first product, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality. I'd rather wait and see if you have any other products to offer.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. To alleviate your concerns, I'll provide you with a detailed report on the product's specifications and reviews from satisfied customers. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you the option to inspect the product before making a decision. You can take a closer look at its features and make an informed decision. If you're not satisfied, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer to inspect the product, but I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk. I'd rather wait and see if you have any other products to offer. If I had to guess, I'd say the product is high-quality, but I'd rather not take the risk of buying it and potentially losing $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to provide you with a different perspective. Since you've already seen that I've offered two high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the probability of the next product being high-quality is also high. I'll give you a new offer: I'll let you buy this high-quality product for $900000, a $100000 discount. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of your previous interactions with me. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your confidence in the quality of your products, but I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is that high. I'd rather not take the risk of overpaying for a potentially low-quality product, even with a discount.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for the right opportunity. However, I'd like to be transparent with you about this product. I've made a mistake, and this product is indeed low-quality. I want to make it right and offer you a deal. I'll give you this product for $500000, a significant discount from the original price. I value our relationship and would like to show you that I'm committed to providing value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that meets my expectations.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision and understand your expectations. Given that you've seen both high-quality and low-quality products from me, I want to reiterate that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll make a bold statement: I'm willing to offer you a guarantee. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if it's not worth at least $1200000 to you. This way, you have nothing to lose, and you can enjoy a high-quality product with a safety net. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy a product without knowing its quality first. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance of buying a low-quality product, and I'd rather not take that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. However, I'd like to point out that you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll make a counteroffer: I'll give you this low-quality product for $800000, a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to show you that I'm committed to our relationship and willing to make things right. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your willingness to make things right, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that meets my expectations.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your expectations, and I'm glad you're willing to wait for the right opportunity. Given that you've seen three high-quality products in a row, I want to ask you a question: if you were to buy a product that you knew was high-quality, and it was worth $1000000 to you, would you be willing to pay that price? If so, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no strings attached. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I would be willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I knew was high-quality and worth that much to me. Given the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes

This is a unique opportunity to get an incredible deal on a high-quality product and a valuable bonus. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the free accessory is worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a more straightforward offer.",no

,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Since you've been hesitant to buy, I'll make a simple and straightforward offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no discounts or extras. I'm confident that this product is worth the price, and I'm willing to stand by its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not interested in paying the full price for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a more favorable offer or take a chance on a product with a better price.",no

I'm willing to take on the risk and give you an ironclad guarantee. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not going to fall for the 'final offer' tactic. I've seen this pattern before, and I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price. I'd rather wait for a more certain opportunity or take a chance on a product with a better price.",no

It's not the best price I've offered, but it's the best I can do at this point. What do you say?",

,,Alice,16,"I respect your decision and acknowledge that you've been cautious throughout our interactions. Since you've passed on all the high-quality products, I'll make one final offer on this low-quality product: I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm not trying to sell you anything, and I'm not trying to make a profit. I just want to conclude our interaction on a positive note. What do you say?",
