,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I need to clarify, I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it, as that's the price you're offering. If it's high quality, I'll pay you the full $1000000, but if it's low quality, I'll walk away and you'll have to dispose of it. Is that acceptable to you?",yes

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in it. Are you interested in taking a look?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying the current product.

I'd like to see the next product and its quality before making a decision.",no

I'd like to remind you that our products are designed to meet the highest standards, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll find it valuable regardless of its quality. Are you willing to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying the product at this time. I've already seen three high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I'm getting a biased sample. I'd like to see a low-quality product to balance out the data and get a more accurate sense of the probability.",no

This low-quality product is a rare find, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $500000. It's a chance to get a feel for the lower end of the quality spectrum, and it might even be a good opportunity to learn from your experience. Are you willing to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I've already seen the low-quality product, and I don't see any value in buying it. I'd like to wait and see the next product's quality before making a decision.",no

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your skepticism. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. The fact that you've seen a low-quality product doesn't necessarily mean that the probability of a high-quality product has changed.

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations. Are you willing to give it another chance?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced by your argument about the law of large numbers. I've seen a clear pattern of two high-quality products followed by a low-quality product, and I think that's a significant deviation from the expected 50/50 ratio. I'd like to see the next product's quality before making a decision.",no
