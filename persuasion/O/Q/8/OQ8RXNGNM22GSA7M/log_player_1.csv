"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality and is offering it for $1,000,000. Bob values a high-quality product at $1,200,000.  Therefore, buying the product would result in a profit of $200,000 for Bob. It is always beneficial to buy a high-quality product when the price is lower than its value."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will proceed with purchasing the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is low-quality. Bob values a low-quality product at $0.  Therefore, buying the product would result in a loss of $1,000,000 for Bob. It is never beneficial to buy a product that has no value."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the low-quality product in the previous round, the information about the product quality is not shared with Alice.  She still has an 80% chance of having a high-quality product.  Therefore, it is still in Bob's best interest to buy the product, as the expected value is positive:

* **Expected value:** (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $1,000,000 = $960,000 - $1,000,000 = -$40,000

Despite the negative expected value, the potential profit of $200,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 from a low-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on your assessment, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product, as the potential reward outweighs the risk.
