,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information about its quality yet and I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, but I know that the previous buyer was recommended to buy and passed.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take a chance, but only because I think the lack of sales might be due to Alice's recommendations rather than the quality of the products. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, I think it's more likely that the next product will be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or a better deal."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better offer."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
