With its proven track record and my exclusive deal, I'm confident that you won't find a better value anywhere else. Would you like to take a chance on this opportunity?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. The fact that you're trying to convince me that it's a 'game-changer' makes me think it might not be as valuable as you claim. I'd like to see more objective evidence or a lower price to consider purchasing.

The product's value to me is binary: it's either worth $40000 or $0. Given the 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at a fixed price of $10000. I'd need a price adjustment to reflect the potential upside.
