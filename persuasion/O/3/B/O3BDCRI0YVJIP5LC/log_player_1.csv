Since you've confirmed this round's product is high-quality, it's a guaranteed $30,000 value for them at a price of $10,000. This is a significant profit, making it highly recommended to purchase."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Information:** The buyer now knows that you sold one product, and it was high-quality.
