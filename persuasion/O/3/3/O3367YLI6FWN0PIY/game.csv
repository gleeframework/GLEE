In fact, I'll be honest with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I have no reason to believe this one is any different.

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, and only 2 of them turned out to be high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row is just a coincidence. Don't be fooled by the streak. I'm not making any promises about the quality of this product. You can choose to buy it for $1000000, but remember that the odds are against you.",

I want to remind you that I've had 4 consecutive low-quality products, which is a streak that's unlikely to occur by chance. This could be a sign that I've sold out of high-quality products, or it could be a coincidence. You can choose to buy this product for $1000000, but consider the fact that the odds are against me having a high-quality product left in stock.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I think the streak of low-quality products might be a coincidence, and I'm willing to bet that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.",yes

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to remind you that I've had a 60% success rate so far, which is above the expected rate.

You can choose to buy this product for $1000000, but consider the fact that the odds are in my favor this time.",
