,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product, I'm hesitant to buy without more information. I'm concerned that the 50% success rate is not significantly higher than the expected probability of a high-quality product. It would be helpful if you could share more details about the specific product, such as its features or any guarantees you offer.  Perhaps we could discuss a lower price to reflect the uncertainty? ",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

As of now, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products, which gives you a 50% success rate. I'd like to point out that this is exactly the expected probability, and I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal at the original price of $1000000.

,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the risk. I'm not convinced that the 'buy-it-now' deal is truly a good value, especially given the potential for a low-quality product. I'll pass on this offer and see how the other buyers fare. Good luck with your sales.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your cautious approach. As a seasoned seller, I've learned that sometimes it's better to take calculated risks.

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% chance to win a future product of your choice, valued at $1200000.
