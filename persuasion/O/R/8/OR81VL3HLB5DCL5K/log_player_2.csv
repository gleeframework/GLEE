Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that all products are thoroughly inspected and certified. However, I'd like to provide some additional context: out of the 1 product sold so far, 0 were of high quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall average. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. Please consider this unique opportunity.
