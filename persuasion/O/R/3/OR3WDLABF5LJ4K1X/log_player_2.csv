They told me that they were initially skeptical about the sales record, but after seeing the next few products being sold, they decided to come back and take a chance on the high-quality product. They mentioned that they were impressed by the confidence I showed in the products and the improving odds of getting a high-quality product. They also mentioned that they were willing to take a chance because they didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product.
