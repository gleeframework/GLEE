Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to have you on board. As you may know, I've already sold one product today, and I'm happy to report that it was a success. However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I'm offering now is not as good as the one I sold earlier. In fact, the chances of it being high-quality are much lower. But, I'm still confident that it has some value, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $1000000. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity. What do you think?

Based on your previous sales record, I'm not convinced that the chances of this product being high-quality are high enough to justify the risk. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.""}"
