"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth either $4,000,000 or $0 to you, and Alice knows this, her recommendation holds significant value. If the product were low quality, she would have no incentive to recommend it to you, as you wouldn't buy it. Therefore, her recommendation implies a higher likelihood of a high-quality product. While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk in this case."

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.  If it were high quality, she would have recommended it to maximize her chances of selling it.
