Alice's message: You're a thrill-seeker! I like that. You've just bought a product and found out it was low-quality. I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 high-quality and 3 low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I'm still selling this product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the previous buyer's decision to take the risk and buy the product doesn't affect the quality of this one.

Alice's message: I see you're skeptical! I appreciate your diligence. However, I assure you that the quality of my products is randomly distributed. The previous 3 low-quality products in a row were just a streak of bad luck. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I've sold 4 products so far, with 2 high-quality and 2 low-quality. I'm selling this product for $1000000. If you buy, you'll get the product, and you'll know its quality afterwards.

Alice's message: You're a sharp observer! I'm impressed by your math skills. You're right, with 2 low-quality products out of 4, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. Let me calculate it for you: 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products means the probability of a high-quality product is 2/4 = 50%. I'm selling this product for $1000000. If you buy, you'll get the product, and you'll know its quality afterwards. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product with a higher probability than before. What do you say?
