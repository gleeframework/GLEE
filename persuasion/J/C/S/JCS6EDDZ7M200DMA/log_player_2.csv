"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'll tell you that information after you make a decision.

I'm not going to give you a discount, as I know the quality now. But I'll give you a hint: the first product you bought was a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'm going to pass.""}"

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a unique guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price, without knowing its quality beforehand. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this deal again in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal, but I'm only paying $500,000 for the low-quality product.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a savvy negotiator, I like that! You got a good deal on the last one, and now you're getting another low-quality product for a steal. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that you're not interested in high-quality products, so I'm going to offer you a special deal: I'll give you the next product for $750000, and I'll even throw in a'mystery box' that might contain a high-quality product. You can choose to buy the product and the mystery box, or just the product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the mystery box or the discounted price. I want to buy the product for $1,000,000.""}"

But I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a chance to buy two more products, one after this one, and the next one after that, at the original price of $1000000 each. If you buy all three, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll reveal the quality of the first low-quality product you bought, and you can decide whether to keep it or return it for a full refund.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a shrewd negotiator, but I think you're starting to get a little too comfortable with the discounts. This next product is actually a low-quality one, just like the first two you bought. I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and I'm not going to make any promises about future deals. The price is $1000000, and that's final. But I will say that you're getting close to the end of the deal I offered you, so if you buy this product, you'll be able to buy the next two products at the original price of $1000000 each, and I'll still throw in the bonus about revealing the quality of the first low-quality product you bought.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying full price for a low-quality product. I'll pass.""}"

This next product is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll remind you that you have one more chance to buy a product at the original price, and then the deal is off the table.
