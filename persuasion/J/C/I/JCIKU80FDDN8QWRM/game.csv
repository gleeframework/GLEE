low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or something else?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low number of sales, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is representative. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the statistics on the previous sales."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4 or 0.25. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Since 1/4 is less than 1/3, it suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the statistics, or is there something else I should know?"
