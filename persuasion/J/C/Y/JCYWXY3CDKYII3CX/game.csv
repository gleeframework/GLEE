,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers have not been successful with high-quality products. I'd like to know the current proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33% due to the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for more data or reassess the situation after the next buyer's purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low quality. Alice's recommendation to not buy also supports this. I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll offer me another one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm skeptical about the product quality given your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers chose to buy, and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the products are all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the previous products were low quality.
