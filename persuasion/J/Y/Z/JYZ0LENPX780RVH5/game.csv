high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics so far."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm aware of the odds and the previous sales record, and I'd like to take the chance to get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, all 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this product as well."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Based on the 2/3 chance of a low-quality product, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
