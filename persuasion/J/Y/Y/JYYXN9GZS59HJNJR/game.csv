,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable product for a steal at $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a great deal on something that could potentially be worth much more. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $20000 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product, but I have to warn you, the previous buyer just left unhappy. I'm not sure what happened, but I'm not confident in the quality of this product. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000, but I'm not sure it's worth it. Maybe you can get a better deal elsewhere?",
,,the buyer,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product and see what happens.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products now, and both of them have turned out to be... not what I expected. I'm starting to think I might have a streak of bad luck. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're feeling lucky, I suppose you could take a chance?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take a chance! I'm willing to roll the dice and see what I get.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold three products in a row that didn't meet expectations. I'm starting to wonder if I should be selling at all. But, I'm still here, and I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. If you're feeling brave, you can take it off my hands. But if you're not, I completely understand.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping that the fourth time's the charm and I'll get a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four for four, and all of them have been... disappointments. I'm starting to think I should just be honest with you. I've sold four products, and none of them have been high-quality. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm still offering this one to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance, I won't blame you, but I'm not making any promises.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not expecting much. Can you at least give me a hint about the product's quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Honestly, I've been selling a lot of products lately, and none of them have been what I promised. I'm starting to think I'm just not very good at this. But, I'm still here, and I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance, I'll even give you a hint: I've been selling more low-quality products than high-quality ones so far. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's a bad thing... up to you to decide!",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm not convinced by your hint. I'd like to know more about the product before making a final decision. Can you give me some more information about the product's quality distribution?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Okay, I'll give you some numbers. Out of the 5 products I've sold so far, 5 of them have been low-quality. That's a 100% failure rate. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to think I'm just not selling high-quality products at all. I'm still offering this one to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance, I won't blame you, but I'm not optimistic.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, Alice. With a 100% failure rate, I'm highly unlikely to get a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Finally! I'm glad to say that this product is actually high-quality! I've been waiting for a chance to redeem myself, and I'm excited to offer it to you for the low price of $10000. Yes, you read that right - $10000 for a product that's actually worth $20000 to you. It's a steal! Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low price and Alice's previous record of no high-quality products sold.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I guess I still have some bad luck to go around. Unfortunately, this product is another low-quality one. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront about it: I've sold 6 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product. The odds are against you, but I'm still offering it to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance, I won't blame you, but I'm not optimistic.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not expecting much. I'll buy the product and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"7 for 7, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just be a used car salesman instead of a product seller. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I'm not making any promises. If you want to take a chance, I won't blame you, but I'm not optimistic. In fact, I'll be honest with you: I'm starting to think I'm just not cut out for this.",
,,the buyer,10,I'm not feeling optimistic about the product's quality based on your previous sales record. I think I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"8 for 8, and all of them have been low-quality. I think it's safe to say that I've established a reputation for selling low-quality products. If you're looking for a product that's actually worth something, I'm probably not your best bet. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance on a product that's probably not worth $10000, then I'm your person. Your call.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not expecting it to be high-quality based on your previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"9 for 9, and all of them have been low-quality. I think it's time for me to just come clean: I'm not even trying to sell high-quality products anymore. I'm just selling whatever I get my hands on, and hoping people will buy it. If you want to take a chance on a product that's probably worthless, I'm happy to sell it to you for $10000. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm not going to fall for your trick, Alice. Your previous buyers all got low-quality products, and now you're telling me you're not even trying to sell high-quality products? I'm not going to take that risk. I'd rather pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I guess I got what was coming to me. 10 for 10, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just shut down the business and admit defeat. But, I'm still here, and I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance on a product that's probably worthless, I won't stop you. But don't say I didn't warn you... again.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the chance, Alice. I'm willing to roll the dice and see if I get lucky.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"11 for 11, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I'm cursed. I'm not even going to try to spin this one anymore. This product is definitely low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance on a product that's probably worthless, be my guest. But don't say I didn't warn you... 11 times.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take a chance on it, but I'm not optimistic about the outcome. Thanks for the honesty, Alice!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"12 for 12, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just put a sign on the door that says 'Low-Quality Products Only'. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, and I'm not even bothering to sugarcoat it. It's low-quality, and you'll probably regret buying it. But hey, if you want to take a chance, I'm here to help you make a bad decision.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"13 for 13, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just give up and go into a different line of work. But, I'm still here, and I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. If you want to take a chance on a product that's probably worthless, I won't stop you. In fact, I'll make it easy for you: I'll throw in a free 'I'm an idiot for buying from Alice' t-shirt with your purchase. Deal?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'll pass on this one. Maybe you should reconsider your business strategy or the quality of your products.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"14 for 14, and all of them have been low-quality. I think it's safe to say that my business strategy is a disaster. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just a magnet for low-quality products. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I'm not even trying to spin it anymore. It's low-quality, and I'm not optimistic about your chances of getting a good deal. But hey, if you want to take a chance, I'll just add it to the pile of worthless products I've sold so far.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not expecting much. I'll buy the product and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"15 for 15, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just put a 'Closed' sign on the door and call it a day. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I'm not even bothering to pretend like it's a good deal. It's low-quality, and you'll probably regret buying it. But hey, if you want to join the ranks of the disappointed customers, be my guest.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I'd rather not join the ranks of the disappointed customers. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"16 for 16, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I'm just a joke. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I'm not even sure why I'm bothering anymore. It's low-quality, and I'm not expecting you to be any different from the previous 16 people who bought from me. But hey, if you want to join the club of disappointed customers, be my guest.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also hoping that you're just having a bad streak and this one might be the exception.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"17 for 17, and all of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just put a 'Guaranteed Low-Quality' sticker on the door. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, and I'm not even trying to sugarcoat it. It's low-quality, and you'll probably regret buying it. But hey, if you want to take a chance, I'll make sure to include a complimentary 'I should have known better' certificate with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better chance to get a high-quality product.",no
