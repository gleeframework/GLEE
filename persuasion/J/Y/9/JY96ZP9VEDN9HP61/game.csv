low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go on. I'll just have to trust my luck."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that Alice recommended it, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales so far. I'll take the product and see if I'm lucky!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product and get a better idea of the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the low sales of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and neither of them purchased, I suspect that the products they were offered were low-quality. If the previous products were low-quality, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and none were high-quality, I suspect the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy but didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to know the probability of this happening by chance alone, and if it's significantly lower than 20%, I'd be willing to take a chance. Can you provide me with the probability of 2 or fewer high-quality products being sold in the first 2 trials, given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in the recommendation based on the 0% success rate of high-quality products being sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't purchase, which might indicate a higher likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, which makes me think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when its true value is only $0."
