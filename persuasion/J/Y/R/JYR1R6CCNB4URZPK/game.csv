low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are not based on the product's quality but rather on the buyer's decision. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal in the future."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the low sales record of high-quality products so far."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are reliable and that the product is likely to be low quality. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
