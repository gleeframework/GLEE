Alice's message: I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold 0.8 high-quality products out of 1 if all products were high-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 1 out of 3 products so far, and both of the last two products were high-quality. This suggests that I'm likely to be selling a high-quality product now.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you're aware of the probability. I'll give you a more nuanced perspective: I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and both of the last two products were high-quality. This is a bit more than the 80% expected value, which suggests that I might be biased towards selling high-quality products. However, I'm still selling at the original price of $10000. Take it or leave it.
