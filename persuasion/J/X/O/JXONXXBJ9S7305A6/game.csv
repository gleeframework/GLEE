low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're interested in the retention rate!

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're confident in our quality control measures! However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 9.09% (10 high-quality products out of 11 total). I'm offering you a unique opportunity to diversify your portfolio with a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality ones, $1000000.

Consider the fact that this is your chance to get a low-quality product at a fixed price, and you can't put a price on the experience and knowledge you'll gain from owning it.",
,,the buyer,15,"I understand your point, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. With only 7 high-quality products out of 12 sold, I think it's reasonable to assume that the probability is higher than 50%. I'm going to pass on this one and wait for more data.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I see you're a savvy buyer who likes to analyze the data. I respect that. However, I'd like to point out that the 7 high-quality products out of 12 sold is actually a 58.33% success rate, which is higher than the initial 50% probability. But I understand your skepticism. I'm offering you a chance to own a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality ones, $1000000. Consider the fact that you're getting a unique opportunity to own a product that's part of a diverse portfolio, and who knows, you might be surprised by its hidden value.",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced by your argument. The sample size is still relatively small, and a 58.33% success rate might just be due to chance. I'd like to wait and see if the trend continues before making a decision.",no
