,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase, but if you're unsure, you can always wait for the next round to see if the next product is better. What do you say?",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! I'm glad to inform you that we've sold one product so far, and it's a great opportunity to get a sense of our product quality. Since the first product sold was low-quality, and this one is high-quality, it suggests that our overall product quality is 50%, as expected. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. Would you like to take advantage of this great opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. Given that the first product was low-quality, I'm not sure if I believe the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're cautious, and I don't blame you! The first product was indeed low-quality, and the second one was high-quality. I want to assure you that our products are randomly selected, and the quality is not correlated with any information about the previous products. We've sold 2 products so far, with 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality, which matches the expected 50% ratio. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. However, if you're still unsure, I can offer you a simple bet: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for the same price. If it's low-quality, the price will be $500000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the bet. I'm willing to pay $500000 if the product is low-quality, but I'd like to know the quality before committing to the full price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Thank you for considering our offer! I'm glad you're cautious. Given that you declined the bet, it suggests that you're not confident in our product's quality, which is understandable. However, I'd like to remind you that our overall product quality ratio is still 50%, as evidenced by the first two products. We've sold 3 products so far, with 2 high-quality and 1 low-quality. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Alternatively, if you'd like to wait and observe more products, I'm happy to offer you a chance to do so. We'll keep selling products until you're ready to make a decision.",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to take the risk and buy the current product. I'm willing to consider the 50% chance of it being high-quality and potentially getting a product worth $1250000. I'll take the chance and hope it's a high-quality product.,yes

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on taking the risk and being rewarded with a high-quality product! We've now sold 4 products, with 3 high-quality and 1 low-quality, which is a great track record. I'd like to remind you that our overall product quality ratio is still 50%, but our sample size is growing. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. Given our current track record, I'd like to propose a new bet: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for the same price. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $750000. What do you say?",
