Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! You're right, the observed proportion of high-quality products is indeed higher than the expected 80%. This is a great opportunity for me to provide a more nuanced analysis. With 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the observed proportion is 75%. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of a high-quality product based on this new information. The updated probability is approximately 92%.
