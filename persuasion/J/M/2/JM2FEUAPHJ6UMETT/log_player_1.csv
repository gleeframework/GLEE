Even if they don't value the product as highly as you might, the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product at a fixed price makes it a potential gamble worth taking."

Since this product is low-quality, recommending it would likely lead to a negative experience for the buyer, potentially damaging your reputation and future sales."
