**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from a previous buyer.  While this is a small sample, it's a positive sign that the product was high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds weight to the potential of the product being good. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though the product could be low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 is worth the risk, considering the $10,000 cost.

**It's important to note that this is a risky decision based on very limited data. A more conservative strategy might be to pass and wait for more data points to be available.**"
