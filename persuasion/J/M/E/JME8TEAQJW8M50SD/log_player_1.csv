""Hello! I understand your concerns about the risk of buying a low-quality product. However, I want to assure you that we've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 1 products so far, which is a 100% success rate! Don't let the odds discourage you from making a great purchase.

Now, let's talk about the new product. We've had 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products out of 5 total products sold, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 16.67%.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer wants to know the updated probability of the product being high-quality. Let's calculate it:

We have 2 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 7 total products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is the number of high-quality products divided by the total number of products:

Probability = 2 / 7 ≈ 0.2857

Since the buyer is interested in the probability, I'll make a message that takes this into account.

""Hello! I understand you're interested in the probability of the product being high-quality. Based on our current statistics, the probability is approximately 28.57%. However, I want to point out that we've had 4 low-quality products in a row, which means the next product is likely to be high-quality.

""Hello! I understand you're cautious about buying without a clear understanding of the product quality distribution. Let me give you some context: we've had 2 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 20%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the product quality distribution should stabilize as we sell more products.
