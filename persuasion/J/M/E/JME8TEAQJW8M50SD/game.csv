high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the product's quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics after you reveal the quality of the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there's no information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced to buy without any information about the product's quality. I'd like to pass and see the outcome of my decision, then you can make a recommendation based on the new information."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one. I'd like to get a better understanding of the product quality distribution before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because there's no prior data to go off of. I'm essentially making a random guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the lack of sales and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the products offered to the previous buyers, and Alice recommended the product to me. Given the low quality of the previous product, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought a product, was it high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered to see if the probability of a high-quality product increases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I think it's more likely to be low-quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product and what happened with it?
