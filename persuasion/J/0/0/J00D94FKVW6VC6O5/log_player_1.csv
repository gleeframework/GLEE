A new potential buyer has arrived!

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 1 product sold was low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product.

I'll send the following message to the buyer: ""Out of the first 3 products sold, 1 was high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%.""

{""decision"": ""no""}"

I'll send the following message to the buyer: ""Out of the first 6 products sold, 3 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.
