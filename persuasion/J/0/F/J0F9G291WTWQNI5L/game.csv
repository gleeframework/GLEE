,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them ended up with a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were all low-quality.

I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which might increase the chances of getting a high-quality one."
