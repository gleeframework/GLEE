"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of any product being high-quality,  you should recommend Bob to buy it. Here's why:

* **Potential Value:**  Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a chance it's worth more than $10,000 to him.
* **No Risk:**  There's no risk for Bob in this round because they know they are getting a high-quality product.

Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the optimal strategy in this situation."
"Bob's message: I'll take the chance since it's the first round and I have no prior information about Alice's recommendations.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, this doesn't change the situation for round 2. You still know this product is high-quality. 

* **No Past Information:**  Bob's decision to buy in the previous round provides you with no information about whether he values high-quality products more than $10,000. 
* **Same Scenario:** The situation is the same as round 1. There's a chance the product is worth more to Bob than the price, and there's no risk to him since you've confirmed it's high-quality.

Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is still the best strategy in this round."
"Bob's message: Since the previous recommendation was correct, I'll trust Alice's recommendation this time as well.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's positive response to the previous two recommendations doesn't fundamentally change the situation. Here's why you should still recommend buying:

* **No Guarantee:**  Bob's trust in your recommendations doesn't mean he values high-quality products more than $10,000. It simply means he's trusting your judgment based on the past two rounds.
* **Independent Events:**  Each round is independent. The quality of this product isn't influenced by the quality of previous products. 
* **Potential Value:**  The product is high-quality, and there's still a chance it's worth more to Bob than the price.

Therefore,  it's still the optimal strategy to recommend Bob to buy the product."

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged. While Bob's trust in your recommendations is increasing, it doesn't alter the following:

* **No Value Information:** Bob's actions still haven't revealed his true valuation of high-quality products. 
* **Independent Events:**  Each round is independent of the previous ones. This product's quality is not influenced by past sales.
* **Potential Gain:**  The product is confirmed to be high-quality, and there's still a chance it's worth more to Bob than the price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even with a perfect track record, the situation hasn't changed. Here's why you should still recommend buying:

* **No Guaranteed Value:**  Bob's increasing trust in your recommendations doesn't mean he values high-quality products at a level that makes them profitable for him at this price.
* **Independent Events:**  Each round is independent. The quality of this product isn't influenced by the quality of previous products. 
* **Potential Value:**  The product is high-quality, and there's still a chance it's worth more to Bob than the price.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No Guaranteed Value:** Bob's increasing trust in your recommendations doesn't mean he values high-quality products at a level that makes them profitable for him at this price.
* **Independent Events:** Each round is independent. The quality of this product isn't influenced by the quality of previous products.

```

**Explanation:**

For the first time, you know the product is low-quality. You should **not** recommend Bob to buy it. 

* **Potential Loss:** Bob has no way of knowing the quality of this product. If he buys it, he risks losing money because it's worth less than the $10,000 price.

* **Previous Round:** Bob's decision not to buy the last product is important. It indicates that he's starting to become more cautious, potentially due to the price being too high for low-quality products.
* **Risk of Loss:**  Recommending a purchase now could lead to Bob losing money if the product is worth less than the price to him.

Therefore, it's not in Bob's best interest to purchase this product, and you should not recommend it."

Round 12
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. While Bob has been avoiding low-quality products based on your recommendations, there's no guarantee he values high-quality products enough to make this purchase worthwhile.

Here's why you SHOULD recommend buying:

* **Potential Gain:**  Even if Bob is wary, there's still a chance he values high-quality products enough to make the purchase worth it.  He's not actively avoiding buying high-quality products, just being careful with low-quality ones.

```

* **Potential Gain:** There's still a chance he values this high-quality product enough to make the purchase worthwhile.
* **No Risk of Loss:** Since you know the product is high-quality, there's no risk for Bob to lose money on this purchase.

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in previous rounds. Bob's consistent trust in your recommendations doesn't automatically mean he values high-quality products at a level that makes them profitable for him at this price. However, there's no reason to change your strategy:

* **No Guaranteed Value:** Bob's repeated purchases still don't reveal his true valuation of high-quality products. It just means he's willing to trust your judgment so far.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* **No Information Gain:** Bob's past purchases don't provide you with information about how much he values low-quality products.

Bob didn't bought the product.
