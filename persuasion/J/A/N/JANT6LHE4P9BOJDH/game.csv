,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware of the neutral recommendation from Alice. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, as there's no prior data to inform my decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the recommendation from Alice, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait and observe more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you provide that?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd rather not take the risk of losing $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy the product and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to me. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales and no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you have some information that suggests it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping the probability of it being high quality is still higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on its quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision, regardless of whether I buy or not."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous 5 buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the probability of it being low-quality, which is against the initial odds of 33.33% for high-quality and 66.67% for low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the previous buyers were aware of the product's quality, and I'm not getting a recommendation, so I'll take a chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 6 buyers, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a better offer or pass on the product to avoid the potential loss of $10000."
