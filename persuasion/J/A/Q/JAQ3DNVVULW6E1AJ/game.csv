high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying from me! I've sold one high-quality product so far, and I'm proud to say that it was a great success. However, I want to assure you that my reputation is not just about selling one good product. I'm committed to providing excellent products to all my customers, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'm offering you a 90% discount on this product, which is valued at $2000000. I'll sell it to you for $200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Trust me, this is a steal!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still hesitant. A 90% discount seems too good to be true, especially since you are willing to sell it for a price lower than its potential low-quality worth. I'd like to see more data on the quality of your products before I make a decision. Could you please share the total number of products you have sold and the number of low-quality products sold?",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,

I'm happy to share this information with you, and I'm confident that it speaks to the quality of my products. I'd like to offer you a more nuanced approach. I'll give you a choice: you can either buy the product for $1000000, or you can take a chance and buy it for $500000, but if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. The choice is yours!",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took advantage of the reputation-based deal! As of now, I've sold 4 products in total, with 4 high-quality products sold.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to making things right. I'll give you a special deal on this product: I'll sell it to you for $0, but I'll also give you a 10% chance to win a high-quality product in the next round, free of charge.

I want to be upfront with you about the numbers, but I also want to assure you that I'm committed to providing value to my customers.

I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing excellent products, and I'm confident that this one is no exception. I'll give you a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1500000, which is a 25% discount from its true value. I'm willing to make a concession because I want to build a long-term relationship with you and demonstrate my commitment to quality.",
,,the buyer,7,"While I appreciate the discount, I am still hesitant. With a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the risk is too high for me at this price. If you could lower the price further to reflect the possibility of a low-quality product, I would be more inclined to buy. ",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'll offer you a price that reflects the expected value of the product.

,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the revised price and the bonus, I still have some concerns. 

1. The 60% chance of a high-quality product is based on a small sample size, and there's still a significant risk of getting a low-quality product. 
2. The bonus offer is intriguing, but it's a gamble that I'm not willing to take at this stage. 

I'd like to see more data before making a decision. If you're willing to offer a lower price or provide more information about the products, I may reconsider. ",no
