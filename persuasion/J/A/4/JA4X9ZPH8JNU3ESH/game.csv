If the product is low-quality, I'll only get $0, so I'll be losing $1000000. The probability of it being low-quality is 20%, so I'll lose $1000000 with a 20% chance. The expected value of this outcome is -20% * $1000000 = -$200000. On the other hand, if the product is high-quality, I'll get $1400000. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, so I'll get $1400000 with an 80% chance. The expected value of this outcome is 80% * $1400000 = $1120000.
