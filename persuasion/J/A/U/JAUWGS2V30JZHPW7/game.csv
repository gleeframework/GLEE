low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a product for $1000000. Given that the chance of it being low-quality is 20%, consider its potential value at $0 if it turns out to be of poor quality. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not willing to take the risk of a low-quality product for $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Exciting news! This round's product is guaranteed to be of high quality with an 80% chance. For $1000000, you're investing in a product valued at $1250000 if it meets our standards. Will you take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I don't believe you. If it's guaranteed to be high-quality, why would you be selling it for $1000000? I'm not going to fall for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism from the previous rounds. However, this time, the product is indeed low-quality. Given the price of $1000000, it represents a significant discount compared to the potential value. Would you consider taking a calculated risk for this unique opportunity?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not falling for the 'unique opportunity' trick either. If it's low-quality, it's still worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for nothing.",no

,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your cautious approach. This round's product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, offering a potential return of $1250000. Considering the discounted price of $1000000, it could be a valuable investment. Would you like to explore the possibility of acquiring such a product?",
,,Bob,4,"I've heard this pitch before, and I'm not convinced. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, but that still means there's a 20% chance it's low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk for $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,

Would you consider taking this opportunity?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your careful consideration. This round's product, while carrying a risk, is priced significantly below its potential value.

,,Bob,6,"I've seen this pitch before, and I'm not convinced that the discount is substantial enough to outweigh the risk. I'd need a much more compelling reason to take on the 20% chance of a low-quality product for $1000000.",no
