high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This suggests that the sample is biased, and I'm not confident in Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is around 80%, but since 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, I'm concerned that the remaining products might be low-quality.
