low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and the fact that 4 previous buyers also didn't buy suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass for now."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the high-quality products, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I infer that the previous products were likely low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'll wait for the next product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to ask: What's the proportion of high-quality products sold in the previous 4 sales?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, it's likely that the remaining products are also of low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product."
