,,Alice,1,"This product is a rare opportunity to get a deal on a product that I'm willing to sell at a discounted price of $5000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable making a purchase without knowing the actual quality of the product. I'm more interested in understanding the product's quality before deciding.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to give you a 'Quality Guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund... of $1000. That's right, you'll get a $1000 refund, even though the product is only worth $0 to you. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I were to tell you that the product is low-quality, would you be willing to buy it for $10000? I'm not saying it is low-quality, but I'm asking you to consider the scenario. If you're willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $10000. If not, I'll keep looking for a better opportunity. What's your answer?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm still hesitant. If I were to buy a low-quality product for $10000, I'd be losing a significant amount of money. I'm not willing to take that risk without more information.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'll pass for now.",no
