If you buy it, I'll give you the second product at the same price as before, just like we agreed. But if you don't buy it, the offer is off the table. What do you think?""

If it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it and get a full refund. What do you think?""
}"

If you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. What do you think?""
}"
