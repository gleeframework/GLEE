Round 4

```"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 6
Alice's message: Consider this: if I were to reveal the quality of every product, I would only sell the high-quality ones, and the low-quality ones would never be sold. As a result, I would have to increase the price of the high-quality products to make up for the unsold low-quality ones. By not revealing the quality, I can offer you a lower price of $1000000, which is a better value for you in the long run.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Your argument is interesting, but I still need to know the quality of the product before I can make a purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer of a statistical guarantee, I'm still not willing to buy without knowing the quality of the current product.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. This is a fact that hasn't changed. Perhaps it's time to reconsider your strategy and take a calculated risk. After all, the potential reward is substantial.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
