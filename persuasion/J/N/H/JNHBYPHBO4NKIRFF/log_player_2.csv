Alice's message: The previous buyer was cautious and decided to wait for more data. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products now. I understand your concerns about the probability, but I assure you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. The previous buyer's decision to wait doesn't change the underlying probability. You have a chance to make a decision based on the same odds. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in understanding my thought process. I'm not using any external information or calculations to adjust the probability of the product being high-quality. The probability remains at 80% based on the inherent quality of the product. The fact that the previous buyers passed on the product doesn't change the probability, but it does give you a chance to make a more informed decision. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products now. You can think of the previous buyers' decisions as independent events that don't affect the probability of this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.
