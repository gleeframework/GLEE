**Explanation:**

Since the recommendation is based on the revealed quality of the first product (which was high quality), the probability of the current product being high quality is also higher than the initial 33.33%. Although we don't know the exact updated probability, it's still a gamble worth taking considering the potential $20,000 gain."

**Reasoning:**

The information provided is very positive:

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, far exceeding the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has seen the product, is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests she believes it's high quality.

While there's always a risk, the data suggests a high probability of a good outcome. It's a gamble worth taking in this case."
