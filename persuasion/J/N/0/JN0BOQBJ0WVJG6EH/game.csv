,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation is any more informative."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm suspicious that the first buyer was unlucky and got a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy, which might be because they didn't want to buy a low-quality product, not necessarily because the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations have been unclear, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
