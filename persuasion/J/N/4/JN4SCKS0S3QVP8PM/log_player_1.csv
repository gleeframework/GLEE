Here's why:

* **High-quality:**  We know this product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 80% of products are high-quality. This increases the likelihood that the product is valuable to him.
* **Price:**  While the price is high, we don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to Bob. It could be worth significantly more than $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Bob is risk-averse, but the potential reward of a high-quality product could outweigh the risk.

This time, it's worth recommending a purchase to Bob."
