,,the buyer,1,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of previous sales to get a better sense of the product's quality and the seller's behavior.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round. Let me put your mind at ease. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a high-quality one. You can see the track record for yourself. I'm offering you a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product, which is worth $3000000 to you. I'm confident in the quality of this product, and I'm willing to let it go for a mere $1000000.

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. I'm willing to offer you this product for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be a great value, even if it's not high-quality. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the current data?,no

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations to the previous buyer on their purchase! As promised, I'll give you an update on the previous product's outcome. The buyer received a high-quality product and paid $900000, which is a great deal for them. Now, let's talk about this new product. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 60%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value of $3000000. Don't miss out on this opportunity to make a great investment. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 60%, but I'm not convinced that it's a good deal considering I don't know the true quality yet. I'd like to wait for more information or perhaps get a better offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your caution. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. I'll make you a special offer: I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product if it's high-quality, and a 20% discount on the next product if it's low-quality.

,,Alice,8,"I'm happy to provide more information. The two low-quality products were sold at the full price of $1000000 each. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness.

I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value of $3000000. I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality, if you buy this one. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to decline this offer. I understand that you've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 50%. However, given that the previous two products sold were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're offering me might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me another product, and I'd like to discuss the 10% discount on the next product separately.",no

Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is 55.56% based on the current statistics. With only 5 high-quality products sold out of 9, the probability is actually 55.56% which is suspiciously close to 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'd also like to know the outcome of the next product before making a decision on it. Can I get that information without having to buy this product?",no
