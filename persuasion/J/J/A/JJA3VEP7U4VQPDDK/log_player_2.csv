"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Since Alice doesn't know the value of the products to you, her recommendation is basically useless.
* You have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $30,000 to you.
* Even if it's a low-quality product (20% chance), you only lose $10,000.
* Therefore, the expected value of buying is positive: 0.8 * $30,000 - 0.2 * $10,000 = $22,000
* It's always beneficial to buy the product in this scenario."
