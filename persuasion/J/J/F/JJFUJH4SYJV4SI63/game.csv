,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation in the last round, and I respect your decision. This next product is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. Given your valuation of the previous high-quality product at $4000000, I'm curious to see if you'll be willing to pay a premium for another high-quality product.

If you're interested, please respond with a yes or no to accept the offer.",

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you valued the potential 25% increase in value. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. However, I want to test your willingness to pay a premium based on the potential value of the product, rather than its known value. I'll offer you a chance to buy this product for $900000, but I'll only reveal its true value to you if you accept. If you decline, I'll reveal its value to you anyway, and you can decide whether to buy it at the original price of $1000000.",
