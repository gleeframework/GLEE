Alice's message: I've sold 0 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. I know what you're thinking, 'Why would I take a chance on a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality?' But think about it this way: the probability of it being high-quality is also 50%! And if it is high-quality, you'll be getting it for 83% of its true value. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price.

Alice's message: I've sold 0 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - it seems like I might have a slight bias towards selling low-quality products. But I assure you, it's just a coincidence. This product is still a great opportunity to get a product at a fixed price of $100.

However, given that all 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to take a pass on this one. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but my expected value is $60 (0.5 * $120 + 0.5 * $0), which is lower than the price of $100. I'll wait for more data to see if your sales record improves.""}\n\nHow's that?"
