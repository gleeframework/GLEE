,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality and that she knows that 4 out of 5 low-quality products were recommended.

I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one, hoping that the probability of a high-quality product has increased."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the product being low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'd be missing out on a good deal, but if it's low-quality, I'd be wasting my money. I'm hoping for the best."
