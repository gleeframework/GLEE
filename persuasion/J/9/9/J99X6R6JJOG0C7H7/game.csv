,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to get a good deal on the first one! As for this next product, I want to be upfront with you - I've had some issues with it in the past.

I've had multiple customers who have been extremely satisfied with it, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. I'm willing to let it go for $5500, which is a $500 discount from the original price. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take a chance on this one, but I'm only paying $5500 because I think it's a good deal and I'm hoping it's a high-quality product. I'm not getting it at a discount, I'm just paying the discounted price because I think the expected value is worth it.",yes

I'm also willing to throw in a special offer - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next one you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This is a one-time offer, so it's a great opportunity to save even more money in the long run.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $6000 for a product that's worth $30000 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal or take advantage of the discount on a future purchase when I can get a high-quality product for a lower price.",no
