high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product. As you know, the first buyer took a chance and made a great decision. I'd like to assure you that the product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, considering the value it holds. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to provide some additional context. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, both have been high-quality.

I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that there's a chance it may not meet your expectations.

I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $1000000. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to wait for the next round and offer you a better chance of getting one. But if you're looking for a deal, this might be your chance to get a product at a low price.",
