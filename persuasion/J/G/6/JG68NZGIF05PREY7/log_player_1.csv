Would you like to purchase it for $100?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the warranty offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy another product at the same price as the previous one, which turned out to be high-quality.

In fact, I'm willing to give you a small discount - I'll sell it to you for $90. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy a product at $100, even with a money-back guarantee. The risk is still there that I might end up with a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take that risk for $100.

}"
