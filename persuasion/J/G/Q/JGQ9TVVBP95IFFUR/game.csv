,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there is no prior information to go by. I'll learn from my mistake if it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm also curious about your reasoning behind the recommendation. Can you share your thought process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it, and the statistics suggest a low proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33% (the probability of a product being high-quality), and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd like to know if there's any information that would change your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are accurate, and she has a good sense of the product quality. Given that she doesn't recommend buying the product, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. So far, none of the high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but based on the previous sales record, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better idea of the product's quality or if Alice's recommendations improve."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests there's a higher chance it's low-quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying this product, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
