While my overall experience is indeed reinforcing the idea that taking the chance can be profitable, I recognize that each product has its own unique probability of being high-quality, which remains at 50%. I'm not feeling that the potential profit is becoming more predictable, but rather that the law of large numbers is starting to play out, and my results are converging towards the expected probability. Given this understanding, I'll continue to take the chance, as the potential profit remains attractive and the probability of success remains unchanged.
