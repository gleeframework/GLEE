Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is still a 66.67% success rate. I'd like to offer you some additional context: I've been selling products for a while, and my overall success rate is still 80%. This one product is an outlier, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I think you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.
