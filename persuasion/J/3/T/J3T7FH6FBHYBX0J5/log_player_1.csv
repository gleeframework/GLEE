Here's why:

* **Bob's Trust:** Bob has established a pattern of only buying products that you explicitly recommend. 
* **No Guarantee:** Even though this product is high-quality, Bob has no way to know that.  You've not yet recommended a product, and Bob has learned to trust your recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** For Bob, the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0 value) outweighs the potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($20,000 value)  given your history of not recommending any products. 

**It's better to stay consistent with Bob's expectations and keep the pattern of only recommending products you believe are worth buying, even if it means potentially missing out on a sale.**"
