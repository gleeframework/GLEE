"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  

It's also worth noting that Alice's recommendation, while not perfectly reliable, does provide some additional information.  We don't know her strategy for recommending products, but it's reasonable to assume she's more likely to recommend products she believes are high quality."

Round 2

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now negative, which suggests she believes the product is likely low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worthless to me, the risk is not worth the potential reward."

While Alice's recommendation isn't a guarantee, it's still a positive signal.  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) still outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).
