Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'd like to caution you that the previous buyer who purchased from me didn't seem too thrilled with their decision. They didn't even bother to ask about the product's history or condition before buying. I'm not sure what to make of that. As for this product, I can tell you that it's a rare opportunity to get a product at a discounted price. I'm selling it to you for $10000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. I'm willing to throw in a 30-day warranty, so you can return it if you're not satisfied. But I have to warn you, I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not sure what that says about my business.
