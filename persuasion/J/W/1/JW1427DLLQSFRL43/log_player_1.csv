"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, it's highly likely this product is not worth the $1,000,000 price.  Without knowing the value of a low-quality product to Bob, it's a risky purchase.  

**Recommendation:** Bob should not buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

This round's product is low-quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues.  Alice has revealed a low-quality product for the third consecutive round.  Despite the fixed price, Bob still lacks information about the value he would receive from a low-quality product. There is no reason to believe this round's product is any different from the previous ones. 

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid purchasing the product until he has more information."
