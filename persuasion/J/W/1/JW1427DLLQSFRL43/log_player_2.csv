"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, and we know low-quality products are far more common, it's statistically more likely that this product is low quality. It's better to pass and wait for a potentially better opportunity in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to not recommend the product, which strengthens the likelihood it's low quality.  It's still statistically better to pass and wait for a potential high-quality product later in the game."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm still waiting for a product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern continues. Alice hasn't recommended buying any product yet, and we know low-quality products are far more likely.  The risk of buying is still too high compared to the potential reward, so it's best to keep passing for now."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant shift! Alice has never recommended a product before, so this is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. Despite the initial low-quality products, the potential reward of a $3,000,000 product is high enough to justify the risk, especially with Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. Given your previous recommendation and the fact that I just bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation is useful, it's not the only factor. We know that low-quality products are far more common, and the fact that Alice recommended the previous product (which turned out to be high quality) makes it more likely that this one is low quality. It's safer to pass and wait for another opportunity, especially since we just made a profitable purchase."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still waiting for a product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to not recommend products, which reinforces the idea that low-quality products are more prevalent. Since the last purchase was successful, it makes sense to wait for another strong recommendation before taking the risk again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm still waiting for a product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation further reinforces the likelihood of low-quality products.  Even though we had one successful purchase, it's statistically safer to wait for a clearer signal from Alice before taking another risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still waiting for a product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern continues. Alice hasn't recommended a product in any of the rounds where it was actually worth buying, and we know low-quality products are more likely.  It's better to wait for a recommendation from Alice before making a purchase."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still waiting for a product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation reinforces the statistical likelihood of a low-quality product. Since we've had only one successful purchase in the past, it's more prudent to continue waiting for a stronger indication of a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally recommended a product again. While we know low-quality products are more common, her recommendation is a strong signal that this product is likely high-quality. The potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the risk, especially since she hasn't recommended a product since round 4, which turned out to be profitable."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it! You've recommended two products in a row now, and the last one was great. I'm confident in your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has recommended buying the product, which is a significant signal that it might be high quality.
* **Recent Success:**  We just bought a high-quality product in the previous round, making us more willing to take a risk.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Alice seems to be more likely to recommend products that are actually high quality.  While low-quality products are more common, her recommendations are valuable indicators. 

Since Alice's recommendations are proving to be reliable, and we are already experiencing a streak of success, it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. While I appreciate your insights, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait for another product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending this product, which suggests it's likely low quality. 
* **Recent Success:**  We just bought two high-quality products in a row, but this doesn't change the overall probabilities of low-quality products being more common.
* **Pattern Recognition:**  Alice's recommendations have proven to be valuable, but her lack of recommendation is also a strong indicator.

Given the statistical likelihood of low-quality products and Alice's lack of recommendation, it's safer to wait for another opportunity.  We've recently had good fortune, but it's best to play it safe and avoid unnecessary risks."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which strengthens the likelihood it is low quality.
* **Recent History:** While we had a streak of success recently, we also had a few rounds where Alice didn't recommend, and the product was indeed low quality. This reinforces the importance of relying on her recommendations.
* **Statistical Probability:** Low-quality products are more common, and Alice's lack of recommendation reinforces this.

It's best to play it safe and wait for a product that Alice believes is worth buying."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a strong signal that it might be high quality. This is a significant factor in our decision-making.
* **Recent History:** While we just had a few rounds where Alice didn't recommend, and the products turned out to be low quality, her recommendations have proven to be valuable in the past.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant, and the risk is mitigated by Alice's recommendation.

Despite the recent string of low-quality products, Alice's recommendation is a crucial indicator that outweighs the statistical probability of the product being low quality."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 15

* **Potential Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant, and the risk is mitigated by Alice's recommendation.

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation.  I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait for another product you think is worth buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a strong indicator that it's likely low quality.
* **Recent History:**  While we just bought a couple of high-quality products, it's important to remember that low-quality products are more common overall.

Given the statistical odds and Alice's consistent pattern of recommending only the products she believes are worth buying, it's wiser to wait for a more promising opportunity."
