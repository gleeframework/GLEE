Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, there's no prior information for the buyer to judge the seller's trustworthiness. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  As the seller is offering a high-quality product this round, recommending a purchase is the best strategy. The buyer can always decline future offers if they feel the seller is not trustworthy."
