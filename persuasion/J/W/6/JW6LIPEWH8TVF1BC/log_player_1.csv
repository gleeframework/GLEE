"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.** This means there's a strong chance this product is worth the $12,000 value to them.
* **The product is worth $0 if low-quality.**  While there's a risk, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

**In the first round, with no prior information about your selling record, the buyer should take the risk.** The odds are in their favor, and they have nothing to lose but the potential investment."

* **This strengthens the buyer's confidence.**  While it's only one data point, it reinforces the 80% probability of high-quality products.
* **The risk-reward remains the same:**  A $12,000 gain is still possible, while the maximum loss remains $10,000.

**Given the positive initial experience, recommending the product again is still the best strategy.**  The buyer should be even more inclined to buy this time, as their initial gamble paid off."

* **The risk-reward ratio remains favorable:**  The potential gain is still $12,000, while the maximum loss is still $10,000.
