,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $100, and if I pass and it's low quality, I'll save $100. If I buy and it's high quality, I'll gain $100, and if I pass and it's high quality, the product will be discarded, and I'll lose the opportunity to gain $100. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (50%), and your previous recommendations, I'm inclined to err on the side of caution and pass on the product."
