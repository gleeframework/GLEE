Alice's message: I understand your skepticism about the probability, but I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and the data we've seen so far is just a small sample size. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 50%, then the probability of 3 high-quality products out of 7 is actually quite high. In fact, it's more than 50% likely that the next product will be high-quality, given the current trend.
