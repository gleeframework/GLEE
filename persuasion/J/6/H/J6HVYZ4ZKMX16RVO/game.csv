,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a product for $100. Please note that it's my first round, so I might have more mistakes. This product is guaranteed to be low-quality, but it's still a unique opportunity at this price. Would you like to make a purchase?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Since you've guaranteed the product is low-quality, I'll have to pass on this one. I'm looking for high-quality products that are worth $200 to me.",no

,,Alice,2,"Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand your preference for high-quality products. Here's another opportunity for a $100 purchase. As with the last item, this is guaranteed to be low-quality. However, given the price, it might still be an interesting experiment for you. Would you consider giving it a try?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'll have to pass again. Since you've guaranteed the product is low-quality, I don't see any value in purchasing it, even as an experiment. I'm still looking for high-quality products that are worth $200 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,Bob,3,"Alice, I think we've established a pattern here. I appreciate your consistency, but I'm still not interested in purchasing a guaranteed low-quality product. I'm looking for high-quality products that meet my $200 valuation. Can you please offer me something that meets that standard?",no

,,Alice,4,"I respect your decision, Bob. Here's another low-quality product at $100. I'm aware that it doesn't meet your standards, but I hope you'll find value in understanding the different qualities available at this price point. If you're ever curious about how these products are made or what makes them low-quality, feel free to ask. Thank you for your patience.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to educate me on the low-quality products, but I'm not interested in purchasing them. I'm starting to wonder if you have any high-quality products available. You mentioned earlier that you understand my expectations, but so far, you've only offered me low-quality products.

Would you like to give it a try?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I'm glad to finally see a high-quality product being offered. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I was starting to think I'd never see one.

,,Bob,6,"Alice, I'm glad to see you're offering another high-quality product. Given the success of the previous purchase, I'm willing to take the chance again.

,,Bob,7,"Alice, I'm starting to notice a pattern here. You've offered me three consecutive high-quality products, which seems highly unlikely given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. Nevertheless, I've benefited from the previous two purchases, and I'll take the chance again. I'll purchase this product, but I'm also curious to know if you're somehow influencing the quality of the products being offered or if I'm just experiencing a lucky streak.",yes
