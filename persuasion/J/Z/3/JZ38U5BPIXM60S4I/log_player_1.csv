Alice should recommend Bob to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Bob's Behavior:** Bob has shown a pattern of refusing to buy, even after Alice's honesty. This implies Bob is skeptical of Alice's ability to provide a high-quality product. 
* **High-Quality Product:** This time, Alice has a high-quality product. Recommending it could break the pattern and convince Bob to trust Alice. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The high-quality product is worth $20,000 to Bob, significantly more than the $10,000 price. Even if Bob has a slight chance of buying low-quality products in future rounds, the potential gain from this round outweighs the risk.
