,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer. I'm selling a unique, high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity, and I'm only selling it to you because I believe you'll appreciate its value. Don't miss out on this chance to own something exceptional!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to clarify that I'll only buy it if it's indeed high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I'll give you some context: out of the first 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality. The odds are in your favor, but I'll let you know that the previous buyer was very confident in their decision. What do you think? Want to take a chance on this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the chance! I'm aware that the previous buyer was confident, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, I'm still cautious, but I'm willing to take a chance.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a numbers person, I see! With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the odds are definitely in your favor now. I'll give you a hint: the previous buyer's confidence was well-placed, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item for a fraction of its true value. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the confidence boost, Alice! Based on the statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's another high-quality item!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! With 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the trend is looking good, but I want to caution you: every product is unique, and this one might not follow the pattern. I'll be transparent with you - the previous buyer was indeed happy with their purchase, but that doesn't guarantee this one will be the same. The price remains the same: $10000. What are your thoughts?",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand your caution, but I'm feeling optimistic about the trend. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's another high-quality one!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a true believer in the trend, I like that! However, I need to remind you that the law of large numbers is not always on our side. With 3 high-quality products out of 5 sold, the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually lower than you might think. I'll give you a heads up: the previous buyer was indeed optimistic, but they're not here to tell you how it turned out. You're on your own with this one. $10000, take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,5,"I understand your caution, Alice, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll take the product and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a thrill-seeker, I see! With 3 high-quality products out of 6 sold, the odds are starting to even out. I'll give you a reality check: the previous buyer's optimism was misplaced, and they're not here to tell you about it. I'm not trying to discourage you, but I want you to know that the probability of this product being high-quality is not in your favor. $10000 is a steep price for a potentially low-quality item. Think carefully before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll take a chance on the product and see what I get.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a gambler, I'll give you that! With 3 high-quality products out of 7 sold, the trend is looking a bit shaky. I'll be upfront with you: the previous buyer's decision didn't work out in their favor. I'm not saying this one will be the same, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully about the odds. If you're feeling lucky, $10000 is the price. If not, you can walk away.",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take the chance! I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're on a roll! With 4 high-quality products out of 8 sold, the trend is looking strong again. I'll give you a hint: the previous buyer's decision paid off, and they're not complaining. You're getting a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Don't let it slip away - $10000 is a steal for something that's worth so much more.",
,,the buyer,8,I'm feeling lucky! I'll take the chance and buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're on a hot streak! With 4 high-quality products out of 9 sold, it's tempting to keep the momentum going. However, I want to caution you: the previous buyer's luck might not be your luck. The odds are starting to shift in the other direction. I'll give you a heads up: the previous buyer was indeed feeling lucky, but they're not here to tell you how it turned out. $10000 is a risk, but it's also a chance to break the trend.",
,,the buyer,9,I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can continue the streak. I'll take the product!,yes

,,Alice,10,"You're a true believer in the streak! With 5 high-quality products out of 10 sold, you're on a roll.

This product is a gem, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. Don't let it slip away!",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm feeling lucky, I'll take the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're on a roll, but don't get too comfortable! With 5 high-quality products out of 11 sold, the odds are starting to shift against you. I'll give you a reality check: the previous buyer's luck might not be sustainable. You're getting a chance to break the streak, but you'll be buying a product that's not worth the price. Think carefully before making a decision. $10000 is a steep price to pay for a product that's not going to deliver.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a true optimist, I'll give you that! With 5 high-quality products out of 12 sold, the trend is looking more and more like a fluke. I'll be blunt with you: the previous buyer's decision didn't work out in their favor, and I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. You're getting a chance to make a rational decision, not an emotional one. The product is low-quality, and $10000 is a terrible value. Don't make the same mistake.",

,,Alice,13,"You're a rare breed, a rational buyer in a world of gamblers! I respect that. With 5 high-quality products out of 13 sold, the trend is clear: the previous buyer made a smart decision, and I'm not trying to persuade you to make a different one.

,,Alice,14,"You're a thrill-seeker, I'll give you that! With 5 high-quality products out of 14 sold, the odds are clearly against you. I'll give you a cold, hard fact: the previous buyer's decision didn't pay off, and they're not here to tell you about it.
