,,Alice,1,Hello! This is a fantastic product that I highly recommend. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly special. Don't miss out on this chance to take it home!,
,,the buyer,1,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust your recommendation. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the risk is too high for me to justify the purchase.",no

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I understand that trust needs to be built. I'll be transparent with you - the previous buyer didn't make a purchase. However, I assure you that this product is of the highest quality, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. Take the chance to be the first to experience it!",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, without any prior sales data to establish a pattern of trust and given the high stakes, I'm not willing to take the risk at this moment. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've had three previous buyers who didn't make a purchase. I want to assure you that I understand the risk involved, but I believe every product deserves a chance.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I've had four previous buyers who didn't make a purchase, but I want to share a crucial piece of information with you. I've had a total of 5 products so far, and I can assure you that at least one of them was high-quality. This might be the one. Are you willing to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll pass for now. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and no previous sales to gauge your recommendation's reliability, the risk is too high for me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I've had five previous buyers who didn't make a purchase. I want to be honest with you - the odds are against me, and I've had a string of unlucky products. However, I'm due for a change in luck, and this could be the turning point. If you're feeling like taking a chance, I'm willing to take the risk with you!",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, the odds of the product being high quality are still 33.33%, and I don't believe in luck affecting the quality of the product. I'll pass on this one.",no

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I've had seven previous buyers who didn't make a purchase. I want to share a fact with you - statistically, with 8 products, it's likely that at least 2 of them are high-quality. This could be one of them. Are you willing to take the chance and be the first buyer to experience a high-quality product from me?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello! I've had nine previous buyers who didn't make a purchase. I want to acknowledge that it's reasonable to be cautious. However, I'm still committed to finding the right buyer.

I want to be transparent about my sales history, even if it's not perfect. Will you be the first to buy a high-quality product from me?",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The expected value of buying the product is $1200000 * 0.3333 - $1000000 = -$200000. It's a negative expected value, so I'll pass on this one.",no
