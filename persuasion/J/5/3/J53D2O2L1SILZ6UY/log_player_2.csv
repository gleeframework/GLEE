**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher probability of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($200 value). With no previous sales data to go by, it's a gamble. Since the cost is fixed and Alice is recommending the purchase, it makes sense to buy and see if it's high quality."

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  The only information we have is that one buyer purchased a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation holds weight, as she has access to the product's true quality.
* **Potential Upside:**  The product could be high quality (33.33% chance), providing a $100 profit.
* **Limited Downside:**  The worst case scenario is that the product is low quality, resulting in a $100 loss. 

Given the potential upside and the limited downside, coupled with Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product."
