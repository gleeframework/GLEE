However, I want to be transparent with you: the previous buyer just bought a low-quality product, and I'm starting to feel a bit... concerned about my reputation. I'm willing to offer this one to you at a 'discounted' price of $500000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this price point. What do you think?",
