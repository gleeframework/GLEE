If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with only one low-quality product. The price remains the same, $100.""
}"

I'll even tell you that I've already sold you four high-quality products in a row, and this one is the exception.

The price remains $100.""

  ""message"": ""You took a calculated risk and bought the last two low-quality products, and now you've been rewarded with a high-quality one! You also got a second product, which is also high-quality, as promised. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product. I'll make it simple: I'll give you a 'price match' guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll match the price you paid for the two high-quality products you already have. If you don't buy it, I'll just take it home and you'll be left with two high-quality products and no chance to buy another one. The price remains $100.""
}"
"Bob's message: Given the 'price match' guarantee is not actually relevant here, since I'd still be paying $100, I'll focus on the potential gain. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and worth $300, I'll take the deal.
