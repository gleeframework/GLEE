low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't have any prior sales data to inform your recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, so I'm skeptical about this one too."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the expected 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received low-quality products, and none have received high-quality ones. I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality, and I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a worthless product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, which suggests that it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation not to buy, it's likely that the products they received were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's possible that the previous 5 products were all low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. I'm basing this decision on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'm trying to take advantage of this information to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given your previous recommendations haven't been very encouraging."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than 50% given the previous 6 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none have gotten a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it seems like the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to be passed by multiple buyers before I consider buying."
