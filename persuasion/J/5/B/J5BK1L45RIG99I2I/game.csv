high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about this, can you reveal the product's quality first? I want to know if it's really high-quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob! Given that the product I'm offering is indeed high-quality, as we've just established, I'd like to offer you a more competitive price of $9500. This is a significant discount from the true value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the revised price, but I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the probability of a high-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product in your inventory?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. The probability of a high-quality product in my inventory is indeed 80%, as you know. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of a low-quality product at a significantly discounted price of $5000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let you have it for a fraction of its 'true value' of $0. It's a risk-free deal, and you can't go wrong with this price!",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product is indeed low-quality. However, I'd like to offer you a 'deal' that's hard to refuse. I'll give you this low-quality product for... $10000! Yes, you read that right. I'll give you a product that's worth $0 to you for the full price of $10000. It's a 'generous' offer, and I'm willing to take a significant loss just to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but this is an absurd offer. I'm not going to waste my money on a product that's worth $0 to me, no matter how 'generous' the offer is. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to offer you a high-quality product, which we've established is worth $12000 to you, for a price of $9000. This is a 25% discount from the true value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm also willing to throw in a 10% chance that I'll give you another high-quality product for free if you buy this one. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is!",
,,Bob,5,"Alright, Alice, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the high-quality product for $9000. The 10% chance of getting another high-quality product for free is a nice bonus, and I think it's worth the gamble.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! You've got a high-quality product worth $12000. Now, let's talk about the next offer. I know you're on a roll, and I'm willing to give you another great deal. This product is... actually, it's not as great as the last one. I'm willing to let you have it for $9000. It's a fair price, considering the last product you got was worth $12000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a 'guarantee' that I'll give you a high-quality product next round if you buy this one.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that this product is a good deal. I just got a high-quality product worth $12000 for $10000, and now you're offering a product that's not as great for the same price? I'm not sure I'm willing to take that risk. Can you tell me more about this product and its quality?",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - this product is indeed high-quality, just like the last one. I know you're thinking that the last product was a great deal, and I'm willing to top that. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $8500, which is a 29.2% discount from its true value. I'm confident that this is the best deal you'll find anywhere, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line.",

But here's the twist: I'll also give you a chance to get a third high-quality product for free if you buy this one. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a significant risk to make it happen.",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, you're really trying to tempt me with this offer! I'll take the deal and buy the high-quality product for $8000. The chance to get a third high-quality product for free is too good to pass up.",yes

It's a 'generous' offer, and I'm willing to take a significant loss to make it happen.",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I think you're trying to pull a fast one on me again! I'm not going to fall for this 'generous' offer. I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no

This product is not high-quality. I'll offer it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a twist - if you buy it, I'll give you a chance to return it to me for a full refund if you don't like it.
