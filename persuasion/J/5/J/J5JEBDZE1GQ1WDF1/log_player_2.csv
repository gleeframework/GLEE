If you buy it, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy from me in the next 19 rounds, the price will be $5000 each. If you don't buy from me in the next 19 rounds, the price will go back to $10000.

Round 2
Alice's message: Great, I'm glad you liked the deal! Since you've already taken the deal, the price for the next 19 rounds is indeed $5000. However, I want to remind you that this is a limited-time offer, and if you don't take advantage of it, it will expire. I'll give you a hint: the next product is also high-quality, and it's worth significantly more than $5000. If you buy it now, you'll be getting an even better deal than the one you just got.

I know you've been doing well with the high-quality products, but this one is a bit of an outlier. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider.
