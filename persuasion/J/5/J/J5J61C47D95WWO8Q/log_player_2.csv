Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products now, which is still a 100% success rate. I understand your concerns about the sample size, but I'd like to point out that it's not just the number of successes that matters, but also the fact that all three high-quality products have been sold in a row. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%.
