low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and that I'll get $12000 if I get a high-quality product, but $0 if I get a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in buying a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially since none of the previous buyers were willing to purchase after her recommendations."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality, based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the overall statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold has decreased, making it less likely that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information about the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that all products are low-quality. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation to buy. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me. Can you share the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers received low-quality products, and I'm skeptical about the quality of the product being offered to me. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record to make a more informed decision."
