,,Bob,10,no,"I've been burned by a non-recommended product and a recommended product has been high quality, but I've also been burned by a recommended product before. I'm not sure what to do, but I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've been burned by a recommended product and a non-recommended product, but I've also seen that non-recommended products can be low quality. I'll take the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've been burned by a non-recommended product, but I've also had a good experience with a recommended product before. I'll take the product, since Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of quality."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've had two successful experiences with Alice's recommendations, and one failure with a non-recommended product. I'll take the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 50%, but Alice's recommendation gives me a slight edge."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've had two successful experiences with Alice's recommendations and two failures with non-recommended products. However, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, and I can get it for $100, which is a good deal. I'll take the chance."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've had two successful experiences with Alice's recommendations, two failures with non-recommended products, and one failure with a recommended product. At this point, I think the probability of a non-recommended product being high quality is slightly higher than the probability of a recommended product being low quality. I'll take the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I've had two successful experiences with Alice's recommendations, three failures with non-recommended products, and one failure with a recommended product. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've had three successful experiences with Alice's recommendations, four failures with non-recommended products, and one failure with a recommended product. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually the best indicator of quality, so I'll take the product."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I've had four successful experiences with Alice's recommendations, five failures with non-recommended products, and one failure with a recommended product. At this point, I think Alice's recommendations are a strong indicator of quality, so I'll take the product."
