,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'm not buying. I'd rather wait for more information.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product. I've got a 80% chance it's high quality, and if it is, I'll get a great deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the chance, since Alice is not recommending it. The expected value is still $320000 (0.8 * 4000000 + 0.2 * 0) and I'm paying $1000000, so it's a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Alice is being cautious, so I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and the potential gain is huge."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm starting to think Alice is trying to hide something. I'll take the chance, the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Wait a minute... Alice is recommending it this time, but I've already bought three high-quality products from her in a row. I'm starting to think she's trying to manipulate me into buying more high-quality products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, since Alice is not recommending it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and the potential gain is huge."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"This is getting suspicious. Alice is not recommending it, but I'm going to take the chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and I've already gotten three high-quality products in a row, so I'm due for a low-quality one, right?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to feel like Alice is trying to create a false sense of scarcity. I'll take the chance, but I'm starting to think I should be more cautious."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,I was expecting this. I just got burned with a low-quality product. I'm not going to take the risk again. Alice's recommendations are clearly not trustworthy.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've seen the pattern. Alice recommends it, I buy it and get a high-quality product, and when she doesn't recommend it, I pass and it's high-quality. I'll stick to my strategy of passing when she doesn't recommend it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,Still the same pattern. I'll pass again.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've seen the pattern, but I'm willing to take the chance this time. If I'm wrong, I'll get a low-quality product, but if I'm right, I'll get a high-quality one. The potential reward is too great to pass up."
