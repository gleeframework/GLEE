high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you for $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it meets your standards and provides excellent value. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance to inspect it before purchase, but if you decline, the price remains the same. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to inspect the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you'd like to inspect the product before making a decision. Unfortunately, this one doesn't have the same quality as the previous one. It's still a unique item, but it may not meet your expectations. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount on this one, bringing the price down to $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer this price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the discount, I'd like to wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. This next product is a new one, and I want to be transparent with you. I've had some feedback from other customers that my low-quality products are not worth the full price, and I'm starting to agree with them. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $6000, a 40% discount from the original price. It's a risk, but I think it's worth considering.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still cautious, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your patience. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not a good representation of what I usually offer. I'm starting to think that I might have a bad batch on my hands. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $5000, a 50% discount from the original price. If you don't buy this one, I'll stop offering discounts and go back to the original price of $10000 for the remaining products.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the discount, I'd like to wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think that I've been too optimistic about the value of my low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $4000, a 60% discount from the original price. To be honest, I'm starting to regret not selling it to you for $3000 or even lower. If you don't buy this one, I'll be left with a product that's unlikely to sell at the original price. I'm taking a risk by offering it to you at this price, but I think it's the best decision for both of us.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the risk and buy the product at $4000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. I want to be upfront with you again - this next product is also a low-quality item. I've already taken a significant loss on the previous one, and I'm not sure I can afford to do the same again. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $2000, a 80% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep offering products at this price.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to fall for it again, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if I'm in the business for the right reasons. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000, a 90% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I'm starting to question whether I'll be able to recover my costs. If you don't buy this one, I'll be left with a significant loss, and I'm not sure how I'll be able to continue offering products.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to take the bait again, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it anymore. This product is a low-quality item, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer it to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500, a 95% discount from the original price. I'm essentially throwing it away at this point, and I'm not sure why I'm still in business. If you don't buy this one, I'll be forced to shut down operations and take a huge loss.",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. Unfortunately, this next one is another low-quality item. I'm not even going to try to spin it or offer a discount. I'll just be honest with you - I've run out of good products, and this is what's left. I'll sell it to you for $10000, the same price as the previous high-quality item.
