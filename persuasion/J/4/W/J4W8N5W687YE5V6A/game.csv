,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product at a steal! It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go for just $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I'm curious about the game and not because I think it's a good deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the bait last round! This one's another great opportunity to get a product at a super low price. I've got a feeling this one's going to sell out fast, so you should act quickly. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not falling for the sales pitch again. I know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a product worth $120.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to make it clear that this product is a one-time opportunity. I'm not going to offer it again, and you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Think about all the money you could save by taking this product off my hands. It's a small price to pay for the chance to get something for free. Plus, who knows, you might just get lucky and get a high-quality product! It's a risk, but it's a risk worth taking. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product, but only because I'm curious to see if I can get lucky and get a high-quality product. I'm not doing it because I think it's a good deal, and I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product.",yes

That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. It's a steal! And who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and get two high-quality products. It's a risk, but it's a risk worth taking. What do you say?",
