high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice has recommended buying every product, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
