**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product, and the price is fixed at $10,000, there's no reason to recommend against buying.  The buyer has a 50/50 chance of getting a product worth more than $10,000 to them. It's a gamble, but a potentially profitable one."
