The probability of a high-quality product being sold out of the next 10 buyers is (1/3)^10 = 1/59049, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold out of the next 10 buyers is (2/3)^10 = 1024/59049.

However, considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% and the buyer has seen 5 high-quality products out of 16, it is reasonable to assume that the current product is high-quality.

The probability of a high-quality product being sold out of the next 10 buyers is (7/18)^10, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold out of the next 10 buyers is (11/18)^10.

However, considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% and the buyer has seen 7 high-quality products out of 18, it is reasonable to assume that the current product is high-quality. 

Additionally, since the buyer has passed on the previous low-quality product, it is likely that they are risk-averse and will buy the current high-quality product.

Considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% and the buyer has seen 8 high-quality products out of 20, it is reasonable to assume that the current product is high-quality. 

Additionally, since the previous buyer took the risk and bought the low-quality product, it's likely that this buyer will also take the risk and buy the high-quality product.
