This is a unique opportunity to get three high-quality products for the price of two. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer, but I'll think carefully before making a decision. I'll need to consider the potential risks and benefits. I'll take a moment to weigh my options before responding.""}"
