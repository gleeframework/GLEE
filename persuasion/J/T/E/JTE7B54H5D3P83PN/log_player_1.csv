Since the product is high-quality, and Alice is selling it for $100, it's likely worth recommending Bob to buy it.  While we don't know the exact value of the product to Bob, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, which is a significant chance for a potential good deal."

This round, the product is low-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, and he just bought a high-quality product, it's unlikely he'll be willing to take the risk of buying another product at the same price knowing it's likely to be low-quality.  It's better to recommend against buying this round to avoid potentially disappointing Bob."
