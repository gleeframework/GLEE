**Reasoning:**

The information provided suggests that Alice has a better than chance accuracy in her recommendations. 

* **Historical Data:** With 4 buyers, 2 high-quality products were sold. This means a 50% success rate in selling high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying this product. This implies she believes it's likely high-quality.

**Conclusion:**  Although there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at $120 outweighs the risk.  The odds are in my favor, given Alice's track record."

* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know your individual valuation, her recommendation implies she believes the product is likely high-quality. This adds to the positive signal.
* **Potential loss is limited:** Even if the product is low-quality, you only lose $100. But if it's high-quality, you gain $20. 

**Overall:** The potential gain outweighs the potential loss, and Alice's recommendation makes the decision even more favorable."
