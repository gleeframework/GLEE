high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers who purchased products also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable in this case."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm a bit concerned that all previous buyers have also passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality.
