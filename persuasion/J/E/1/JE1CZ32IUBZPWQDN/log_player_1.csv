}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the current product. Given the sequence of sales you provided, I notice that the first product sold was high-quality, and then the next three products were alternating between high and low quality. This suggests that the quality of the products may be independent of each other. However, I also notice that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 3/6 = 0.5, which is higher than the expected 1/3. This might suggest that the true probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. Nevertheless, I'll take a chance and buy the product, as the potential reward is substantial.
