"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, you know this product is high-quality.  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  Even though they don't know this specific product is high-quality, the expected value of buying is:

* 33.33% chance of a high-quality product * $30,000 value - 66.67% chance of a low-quality product * $0 value = $10,000

Since the expected value ($10,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it is in the buyer's best interest to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no historical data on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this purchase. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I commit to buying.

The buyer is right to ask for historical data, but since you haven't sold anything yet, there is no evidence to share. It is better to wait for a high-quality product and build a positive track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since this is the first product and there's no data on the quality of past sales, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products before making a purchase.

Here's why you should recommend the purchase:

* **You know this product is high-quality.**  You can be confident that the buyer will receive the full value if they purchase it.
* **It's an opportunity to build a track record.**  The buyer is looking for evidence of quality. This purchase will be the first data point, and it's a positive one.
* **The expected value is still favorable.**  Even with no prior sales, the buyer understands the probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). The expected value of $10,000 is still greater than the price of $10,000.

You can say something like:

""This product is indeed high-quality! I understand you're looking for evidence of my past sales, and while this is my first offer, I assure you this product is a great value. It's a chance for you to see the quality of my offerings firsthand."""
