,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy this product, since Alice didn't recommend it. Given that I've seen two high-quality products in the last two rounds that Alice didn't recommend, I'm starting to think that her recommendations might not be a reliable indicator of quality."
