Alice's message: I understand your calculation, but I'd like to point out that you're focusing on the expected value of the product. However, I'm offering a fixed price of $10000, not a variable price that depends on the product's quality. This means that if you buy this product, you'll get it for a guaranteed price, regardless of its quality. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a fixed price, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's lower than the expected value of a high-quality product. Consider this a value proposition, rather than just a gamble.
