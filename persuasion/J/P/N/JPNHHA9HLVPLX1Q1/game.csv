,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! Now, let's talk about the next product. I want to be upfront with you - this one is not as good as the last one. It's a lower-end model, and I'm not expecting the same level of enthusiasm from it. That being said, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a good opportunity to get a decent product at a discounted price, and I think it's worth considering.",

,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision-making process. I'll be honest with you, this product is not my best work. I'm willing to let it go for a very low price - $500000. It's a fire-sale price, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're not interested, I'll just have to take a loss on it, but I thought I'd throw it out there as an option.",

It's a low-quality item, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer it to you. I'll sell it to you for $300000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.
