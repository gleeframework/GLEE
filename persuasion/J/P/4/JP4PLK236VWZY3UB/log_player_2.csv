Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency! Since you've already seen the results of the previous products, I'll be more direct with you. Unfortunately, the product I'm offering now is not as exceptional as the previous ones. However, I still believe it has some value, even if it's not high-quality. Considering the price is non-negotiable at $10000, I'd like to ask you to take a closer look at the product and decide if it's worth the investment.
