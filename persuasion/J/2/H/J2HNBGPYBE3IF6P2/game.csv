low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious. I'll be upfront with you, the product I have now is not as good as the one I showed you last round.

I'm willing to give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this product, meaning if you're not satisfied with it, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to let you know that this low-quality product is actually one of the better ones I have left.

I'm willing to give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll throw in a small gift with the product, something that's worth at least $20, if you buy it now. It's a one-time offer, and I won't be able to give you any more incentives if you wait.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to get rid of these low-quality products, or do you think I'm trying to get the best price for them? If you think I'm trying to get rid of them, then it's probably best to wait for the next round. But if you think I'm trying to get the best price, then this low-quality product might be a good deal for you. I'll give you a simple yes or no question: do you think I'm trying to get rid of this product, or am I trying to get the best price for it?",

I'm simply presenting it to you as-is, at the full price of $100. I want to give you a chance to experience the full range of my products, but I also want to be transparent about what you're getting.
