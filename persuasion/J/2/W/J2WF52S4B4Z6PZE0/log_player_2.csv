Alice's message: No problem at all! I'm happy to share some information with you. My first customer bought a low-quality product, but don't worry, I'm still learning and improving my sales process. This next product is another chance to take a risk and potentially get a great deal. I'm still offering it to you for $100, and I'm hoping you'll take the chance on me. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, which means I've got a 50% success rate... not bad for a new seller, right?

Alice's message: I love your analytical approach! You're absolutely right to consider the statistics. I've now sold 2 low-quality products out of 3 total products sold, which means the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than I initially thought. I'm still offering this next product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: the odds are against me, and it's possible that this product is also low-quality. However, I'm hoping that my next product will be the one that turns the tide in my favor.
