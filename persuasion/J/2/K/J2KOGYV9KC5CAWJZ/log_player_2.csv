Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a reduced price of $50. I'm willing to wait for a high-quality product that's worth $400 to me.""}"

It's worth $400 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $100. I know it's a bold ask, but I believe this product has the potential to bring you even more value than the last one. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for another high-quality product. I already got a great deal on the previous one, and I don't want to overpay. I'll wait for the next opportunity.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay $150 for a high-quality product. I think I can get a better deal elsewhere, and I'd rather wait for another opportunity.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I respect that. To be honest, this particular product isn't one of my best offerings. It's not worth the $100 price tag, and I'm willing to let it go for... $75. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a significantly discounted price, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $75 for a high-quality product. I'm holding out for a better deal, and I'm not convinced this is the right opportunity for me.""}"

If you're not interested, I'll just have to move on to the next customer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to sell it to me at a low price, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'm not going to pay $50 for something that's worth $0 to me.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already taken a loss on this product, and I'd rather not have it sit on my inventory. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. It's a product I don't need, and I'd rather get it out of my hands than let it go to waste.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you're being so generous, but I'll take the product for free. It's not worth anything to me, but I'll take it off your hands.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement earlier. This next product is actually a bit of an anomaly, and I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you. It's not worth anything to me, and I'm not expecting you to be interested. But I'll give you a heads up - it's not a low-quality product like the last few. It's actually a bit of a mystery item, and I'm not even sure what it does. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to pay that price. It's more of a curiosity than anything else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a mystery item that's not even worth anything to you. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product now.""}"

Round 11
Alice's message: I think we've been over this before, and I respect your decision.

I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to be transparent. If you're not interested in this deal, I'll just have to move on to the next customer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your frustration, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product.
