,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested! With two high-quality products sold out of three, the data is starting to look good for this business.

The odds are still in my favor, but I want to make sure you're aware of the possibility of a low-quality product. I'm offering this next product for $10000, and I'm confident it's a high-quality one. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"Alice, thanks for the transparency. I appreciate your honest assessment of the risks.

In reality, I've sold a total of 6 products, and 4 of them were high-quality, while 2 of them were low-quality. I'm offering this next product for $10000, and I'm not going to lie, the odds are against it being high-quality. But hey, you might get lucky! What do you think?",
