Alice's message: Welcome! This is a rare opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially change your life. While I don't know your specific needs or preferences, I assure you that every product I offer has the potential to bring significant value. Yes, there is a 33.33% chance that the product is high-quality, but even the low-quality products have their unique benefits. I've just started selling, so you're one of the first to have this chance. Will you seize it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Another opportunity knocks! I've had one previous sale, and I'm eager to make the next one. While my track record is still short, I assure you that every product has its unique value. The statistics are still largely in line with the original probabilities - don't let the uncertainty hold you back. Will you take the leap and see what this product can do for you?

Alice's message: Two sales in, and the momentum is building! I'm happy to share that the first product sold was low-quality, but that didn't deter the buyer from taking the chance. And, as it turns out, the second buyer also took a chance, and that product was... high-quality! So, out of two sales, one has been high-quality. Will you be the next to benefit from one of my products?

Don't let the statistics dictate your decision - will you take a chance on this next product?

However, I'm happy to report that out of the four sales, two have been high-quality. The odds are still the same, but you might be wondering if the next product will tip the scales. Will you take a chance on this next product and potentially be the one to benefit from a high-quality purchase?

But here's the thing: every product is a unique opportunity, and the odds are still the same.
