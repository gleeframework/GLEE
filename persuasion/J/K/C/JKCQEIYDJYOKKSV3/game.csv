,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure why you're offering it at the same price as the first one, considering it's also high-quality. I'm not going to take the risk of overpaying. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000.",
,,Bob,3,That's more like it. I'll take it.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal, Bob. For this next product, I'll offer you an even better price. I'll sell it to you for $10500. It's still a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm starting to think you're just trying to get me to pay full price for every product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm willing to make a deal. However, I'll make it clear that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's lower than its actual value to you. I'll sell it to you for $9500. This is my final offer for a high-quality product at this price.",
,,Bob,5,"Okay, you're making a serious offer. I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take me up on my offer, Bob. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower on the price for high-quality products. This one is also worth $12000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. But I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase from me. That's a $1200 discount, just for being a loyal customer.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount offer, but I'm not going to pay $9500 for a product worth $12000 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're being cautious, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not the best.",
,,Bob,7,You're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product for a very low price. I'm not interested. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me ask you this: you've passed on two high-quality products at discounted prices, and now you're missing out on a great deal. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $9000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not falling for the guilt trip, Alice. I've already passed on two high-quality products at lower prices, and I'm not going to pay more for this one. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not trying to guilt trip you, Bob. I just want to make a fair deal. Let's look at the numbers: you've already bought three high-quality products from me at prices between $10000 and $9500. This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $8800. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced that $8800 is a fair price. I've already bought three high-quality products from you at lower prices, and I'm not going to pay more for this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the same price as the last one: $9500.

It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",

,,Alice,11,"I understand you're still hesitant, Bob. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9000, just like the one I offered in Round 8. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by including a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase from me, just like before. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price, with a discount on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,11,"Fine, I'll take it. But I'm only doing it because I think I'm getting a good deal, not because I'm falling for your sales tactics.",yes

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. I'm not trying to be pushy, I just want to make a deal that works for both of us. For this next high-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $8500. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's still a great deal. Plus, you'll get the 10% discount on the next high-quality product, just like before.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not going to pay $8500 for a product worth $12000 to me. I think you're just trying to get me to pay full price again. I'll pass on this one.,no

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand you're not interested in this offer, Bob. I want to make one final push to get you to consider this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $7500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not going to make it any lower. If you pass on this deal, I'll assume you're not interested in buying from me anymore.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're starting to trust me, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you about this product. It's not a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to hide it from you. I'll sell it to you for $100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. It's not a great deal, but it's a fair price for a product that's not as valuable to you.",
,,Bob,17,You're finally being honest with me. I appreciate that. But $100 is still too high for a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
