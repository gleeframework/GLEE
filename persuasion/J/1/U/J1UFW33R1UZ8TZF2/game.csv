,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal last round. This round, I have another product available, but I want to be upfront with you - I've had some issues with the supplier, and I'm not as confident in the quality of this one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. If you're looking to take a calculated risk, this might be an opportunity for you.

I'm not confident that this product meets our usual standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I know it's still a risk, but I think it's worth considering given the price point.",
