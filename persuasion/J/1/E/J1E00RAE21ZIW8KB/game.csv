low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the first buyer, so there's no previous sales record to consider, and I'll have to make a decision based on the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which is still 33.33% likely."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not based on any information that I have. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the fact that Alice has not recommended it to the previous two buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm taking into account that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations and didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'd like to take the chance and see if I'm the one who gets the good one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I suspect that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. With 5 buyers, and 10 products sold (since each buyer gets one product), I'm expecting a high-quality product to be offered with a probability of 33.33%. However, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to know the exact probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that 7 previous buyers have passed on the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'm going to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 8 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and thus avoid losing $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, 9 out of 10 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for another product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance, as I'm not sure what's going on with the previous buyers' decisions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to take the product despite your recommendation, I'm a rational buyer and I'll take into account the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 11 purchases. Is it 1/12, 1/11, or something else?"
