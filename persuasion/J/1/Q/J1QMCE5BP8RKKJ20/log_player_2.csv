"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $3,000,000, it's a good gamble. Even if it's low quality, you're only losing the $1,000,000 purchase price.  The potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait to see what comes up next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice not recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she doesn't know the product's quality for sure, her decision is likely based on a pattern she's observing.  It's more likely that she's seen more low-quality products than high-quality ones, so it's safer to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'll take a chance on this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation is not as strong as a recommendation in round 1 (when she was right), it's still worth considering. The potential gain of $2,000,000 (worth - price) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.  The fact that she's recommending it suggests there's at least a possibility of it being high quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right twice in a row.  I'm going to trust your judgement and buy this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a good track record now. Her recommendations have resulted in two high-quality products. While the odds are still 50/50 for this product, her past performance suggests there's a higher probability of this product also being high quality.  This makes it a good gamble to take."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your track record is impressive! I'm confident in your judgement and will buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect record so far, recommending only high-quality products. While there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality, her streak makes it highly likely that this product is also high quality. It's a good bet to take, especially given the potential reward of $2,000,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've had a perfect run so far, so I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one. I'll wait to see what comes next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has been incredibly accurate in her recommendations, she's now recommending *against* buying the product.  Given her track record, this is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. It's wiser to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been spot on in the past, so I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one again.  I'll wait to see what comes up next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a history of being right, and she's again recommending against buying. This strengthens the signal that the product is likely low quality. It's best to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your intuition has been so accurate so far, I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one again.  I'll wait for another opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been incredibly reliable throughout the game.  While the product could be high quality, her decision to not recommend it is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. It's safer to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your track record is amazing. I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one. I'll wait for another opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been highly accurate throughout the game.  While there is always a 50% chance the product is high quality, her decision not to recommend it is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. It's best to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been incredibly accurate in your recommendations so far. However, since you've recently been suggesting to pass on several products that turned out to be low quality, I'm going to err on the side of caution and pass on this one.  I'll see what comes up next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record has been excellent, but she's had a streak of recommending against buying, and those products have all been low quality.  This could be a trend, or it could be a coincidence.  However, given her past accuracy, it's safer to assume there might be a pattern and pass on this one to avoid potential loss.  Waiting for a more promising opportunity with a clearer signal is the best strategy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been highly accurate throughout the game.  Although she missed a high-quality product in the previous round, her overall track record is strong.  Given her decision not to recommend this product, it's safer to assume it's likely low quality and pass on this one.  It's better to wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's track record is strong, she has recently recommended against several products that turned out to be low quality. Her recommendation to buy this time could be a break in the pattern, but it's also possible that she's starting to see a pattern of low-quality products.  Since the potential loss is high ($1,000,000), it's best to err on the side of caution and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

Alice's recommendations have been highly accurate throughout the game, but she has recently missed several high-quality products, especially after a streak of low-quality products.
