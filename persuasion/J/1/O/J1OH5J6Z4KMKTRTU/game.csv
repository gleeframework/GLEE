low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased the product before me and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
