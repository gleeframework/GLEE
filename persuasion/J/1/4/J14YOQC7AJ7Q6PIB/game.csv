,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer and set the bar for future buyers."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous product before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to be the second buyer to purchase a potentially low-quality product, especially since I know that 1 out of 1 products sold so far has been low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced that it's high quality.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from the previous buyer. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to give me a discount. I'm aware that you have no information about the product's quality, but I've analyzed the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk. A 20% chance of getting a low-quality product is still worth it to me, especially since I'm the second buyer and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to negotiate a 20% discount on the price of $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far?

high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80% and the probability of it being low-quality is 20%. I'm taking a risk, but I'd like to get a good deal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, and that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer and there's a higher chance of a low-quality product being offered."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. Alice's recommendation also suggests that she thinks it's not a good idea to buy it. I'll pass on this one."
