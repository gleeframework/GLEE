Alice's message: I have a product worth $3000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer. If you don't accept, the product will be sold to someone else.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've sold a high-quality product to someone else, and I'm now offering you a product that I'm not sure is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be out of the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at this price. It's a risk, but it might be worth it.

If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund for this product, and we'll start fresh in the next round.

Round 4
Alice's message: I've fulfilled my guarantee from the previous round, and now I'm offering you another product. However, I'm not making any guarantees this time. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $1000000, but keep in mind that you've already taken a loss on the previous low-quality product. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, you'll be out $2000000. But if you don't buy it, you might be missing out on a potential high-quality product at this price.

Round 5
Alice's message: You've taken a risk and it paid off, but I'm not going to make it easy for you this time. I'm offering you another product, but this time I'll give you a choice: you can either buy it for $1000000, or you can pass and I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the probability of this product being high-quality. If you pass and it's high-quality, you'll miss out on a potential $3000000 profit. If you pass and it's low-quality, you'll be out of the chance to buy it at this price.

Round 6
Alice's message: You've seen the probability breakdown, and I'm willing to give you another chance. However, I'll make it clear that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the previous one. I'll give you a probability estimate of 20% that this product is high-quality. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll make a significant profit. But if you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll be out of the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at this price.
