"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to offer you a second chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price of $10000. If you don't buy this one, I'll offer you another product, and we'll play again. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. Please offer me the next one.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you gave me a chance to offer you a high-quality product! This one is indeed a high-quality product, worth $20000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, which is a 50% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering another product at this price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product for $10,000, it's a great deal!""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! Now, let's be honest, I know what you know about the previous product being high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price of $10000. However, I want to make it clear that this is a separate product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. If you buy this one, you'll get another great deal, but if you don't, I'll offer you another product, and we'll play again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I believe you about the 33.33% probability. You know I just got a great deal on the last one, so I'm going to pass on this one and see what the next one is.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you. To alleviate your concerns, I'll offer you a sealed envelope with a note that says either 'High-Quality' or 'Low-Quality'. You can open it after you've decided whether to buy the product. If you open it and see that it says 'High-Quality', you can buy the product for $10000. If it says 'Low-Quality', the envelope will be worthless, and you'll get to see the next product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product based on a sealed envelope. I'll pass and see what the next product is.""}"

Round 5

This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a potential discount on the next one. I'll pass and see what the next product is.""}"

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate. If you don't take it, I'll offer you another product, and we'll play again.

I'm willing to offer you a 'no-strings-attached' guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a full refund if it's indeed low-quality. You won't lose anything, and you'll have the chance to get another product next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your guarantee. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll just be throwing away $10,000. I'll pass and see what the next product is.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you. However, I'll make you a counteroffer. I'll give you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $5000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. If you don't like it, you can still pass and see what the next product is. But if you do buy it, I'll give you a second chance to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $10000, and I'll guarantee that it's high-quality this time.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm starting to think I've worn out my welcome. Let's try something different. I'll give you a choice: I'll either give you a detailed description of the product's features and specifications, or I'll give you a sealed box with a note that says either 'Low-Quality' or 'Not Low-Quality'. You can choose which one you prefer. If you choose the description, you can decide based on the product's merits. If you choose the sealed box, you'll get a binary decision, but at least you'll know it's not low-quality. What do you say?

I'll give you a simple, one-question quiz: 'Is this product high-quality or low-quality?' If you answer correctly, you get to buy the product for $10000.
