Alice's message: I've had 9 products so far, with 4 of them being high-quality and 4 sales. Three of the sold products were low-quality. To calculate the expected value, let's assume the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80% (although the sales record might suggest otherwise). The expected value would be 0.8 x $125 = $100. If we compare this to a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, the expected value would be 0.5 x $125 = $62.50. However, please keep in mind that the actual probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 80%, considering the sales record.
