"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $30000, but I'll only sell it to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I really need to get rid of this product quickly.

This one is also a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. However, I want to make it clear that this is not a repeat of the previous product, and you won't be getting the same one. This is a new, separate product that I'm offering to you exclusively.

But I'm still willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000. I know it's a risk, but I'm counting on your trust in me to make a decision.
