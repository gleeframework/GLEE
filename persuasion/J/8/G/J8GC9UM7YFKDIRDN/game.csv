high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, and considering the high probability of low-quality products (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high quality seems low. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,I'm willing to take the risk based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current 33.33%

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, it is likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,no,

,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the 7th buyer based on the current statistics. Is it still 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I could get a great deal.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
