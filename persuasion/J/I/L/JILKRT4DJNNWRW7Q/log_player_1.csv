"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I want to make sure I'm not being too optimistic. Since the last three sales were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 50%. Given that, I'll calculate the expected value of the product. If it's high-quality, I'll get $30000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value is ($30000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $15000.
