The distribution of high-quality and low-quality products was random, with no apparent pattern or correlation between the quality and any other factor. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1,000,000? Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 42.11%, based on the data we've collected so far. I'd like to remind you that the sample size is still relatively small, and it's possible that the probability is still 33.33%. Would you like to consider these factors when making your decision? Additionally, I'd like to offer you a chance to ask me any questions you have about the products or the sales process. I'm happy to provide any information I can to help you make an informed decision.""
