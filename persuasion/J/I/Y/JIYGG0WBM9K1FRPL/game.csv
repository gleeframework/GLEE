,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather information about the quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the first buyer didn't buy it and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the products sold so far have been low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both ended up with low-quality products, I'm cautious and would like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on my value assessment, but rather on her own information about the product's quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the high probability of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't affect my decision, but I want to know the true quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely biased by her previous sales record, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the quality of the product for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite her recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are not based on the product's quality. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 5 previous buyers purchased the products with your recommendation suggests that they were likely low-quality products, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, based on the low success rate of high-quality products in previous sales."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or see the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 5 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm wondering if there's a pattern here. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it."
