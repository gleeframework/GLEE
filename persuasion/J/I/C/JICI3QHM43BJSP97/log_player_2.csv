Alice's message: You're the 4th buyer of the day. I understand you're cautious, and I appreciate your diligence. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'll give you a more nuanced view: with 3 low-quality products sold so far, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll be honest with you, it's around 25% now. I'm still confident that this one is a great deal, but I want to be transparent about the odds. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $100?

Alice's message: You're the 5th buyer of the day. I'd be happy to explain the probability calculation. Since I've sold 3 low-quality products and 0 high-quality products so far, I've sold a total of 3 products. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, which means the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. Given that 3 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Based on the data, the updated probability is approximately 14.29%. I'm still offering this great deal for $100. Would you like to take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: You're the 6th buyer of the day. I understand your cautious approach, and I respect your decision to wait for more information. I'll give you an update: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 14.29%. However, I'd like to offer you a more transparent approach. I'll provide you with a 'probability meter' that reflects the current odds. Imagine a meter that's currently at 14.29%. If I sell another low-quality product, the meter will move further to the left, making it even less likely that the next product is high-quality. But, if I sell a high-quality product, the meter will move to the right, increasing the likelihood. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100, or would you like to wait and see how the probability meter evolves?

Alice's message: You're the 7th buyer of the day. Congratulations to the previous buyer who took the risk and won! I'm glad to inform you that this round's product is high-quality. The probability meter is now at 25% (14.29% + 10.71% from the previous high-quality product). I'll keep updating the meter with each sale. If I sell another high-quality product, the meter will move to 37.5%. If I sell another low-quality product, the meter will move to 10.71%. You can track the meter's progress and make an informed decision. This product is still available for $100. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?

Alice's message: You're the 12th buyer of the day. I'm happy to clarify the reset deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll indeed reset the probability meter to 33.33% for the next buyer. However, if this product is low-quality, the reset deal doesn't apply, and the probability meter will remain at 16.67% (1 high-quality product out of 6 total products). You won't get a refund, but you'll have the opportunity to buy the next product at the original price of $100. The catch is that you'll be taking on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, just like any other buyer. This product is still available for $100.

Alice's message: You're the 15th buyer of the day. I'd be happy to explain the calculation. The probability of a product being high-quality is 28.57% (2 high-quality products out of 7 total products). To estimate the probability of this specific product being high-quality, I used a Bayesian update. Given that the previous product was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is slightly lower than the overall probability. I calculated it as 23.81% by considering the prior probability (28.57%), the likelihood of the previous product being low-quality (71.43%), and the number of high-quality products sold so far (2). This product is still available for $100. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?

Alice's message: You're the 16th buyer of the day. I'd be happy to walk you through the math behind the Bayesian update. The probability of a product being high-quality is 28.57% (2 high-quality products out of 7 total products). When we update this probability with the new information that the previous product was low-quality, we use Bayes' theorem. The updated probability of this product being high-quality is calculated as: P(high-quality) = (P(high-quality) * P(low-quality | high-quality)) / (P(high-quality) * P(low-quality | high-quality) + P(low-quality) * P(high-quality | low-quality)). Plugging in the numbers, we get: P(high-quality) = (0.2857 * 0.4286) / (0.2857 * 0.4286 + 0.7143 * 0.2857) = 0.2381 or 23.81%. This product is still available for $100.
