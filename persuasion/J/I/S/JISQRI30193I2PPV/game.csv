I'm starting to wonder if there's something going on with my inventory. I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one, but I'm not going to negotiate the price down to $80.

Given the previous low-quality products, I'm not sure if I can convince you to buy this one at the full price of $100. I'm willing to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the one you just bought. I'm offering it to you for $80, and I'm willing to throw in a small bonus - a free accessory that complements the product. It's a great value, and I think you'll find it useful.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what to make of your message. You're saying this product is not as good as the last one, but you're still trying to sell it to me at a higher price than the last two low-quality products. I'm going to have to pass on this one.",no
