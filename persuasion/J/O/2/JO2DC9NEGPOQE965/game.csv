low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I have no information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is of low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer was recommended to buy it and didn't. This makes me suspect that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that the previous buyer didn't buy based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process and how they weighed the odds of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation, please."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high quality is 50%, but the fact that Alice is recommending it makes me suspicious. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation is just a coincidence or a genuine signal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think it's worth the risk given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it seems like the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that all the products recommended so far were low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product, it seems that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better offer or get more information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, can you tell me why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I'm starting to suspect that all the products sold so far are low-quality. If that's the case, I'd be very unlucky to get a high-quality product as the 5th buyer."
