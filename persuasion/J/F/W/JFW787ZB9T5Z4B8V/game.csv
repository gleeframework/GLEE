,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'll decide based on my own probability calculations."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 failed purchases and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll save $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it, which might imply that it's low quality. If it's indeed low quality, I'd be happy to pass on the information to you, Alice, for future reference."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products and none were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before considering a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' decisions and there's no guarantee that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively low, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed, it's likely that the product is low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality, and the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, and the fact that you're not recommending it might indicate that it's more likely to be low quality."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your past recommendations haven't been accurate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
