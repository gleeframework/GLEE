Alice's message: You're a clever buyer, and I respect your analysis. You're right that the data suggests the true probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%.

Alice's message: You're a thorough buyer, and I respect that. I'll give you the additional data you requested. Out of the 8 buyers who didn't purchase a product, 4 of them were offered a low-quality product, and 4 of them were offered a high-quality product.

The first 3 buyers who purchased a product were offered the following: buyer 1 got a low-quality product, buyer 2 got a low-quality product, and buyer 3 got a high-quality product.

I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 15 total products I've offered, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 40%.
