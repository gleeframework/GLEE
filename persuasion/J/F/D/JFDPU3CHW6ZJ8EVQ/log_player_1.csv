Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice should still not recommend buying the product.  Here's why:

* **No Incentive to Change:**  The buyer is rational and knows the product is 50% likely to be low quality.  Since there's no data yet to suggest Alice is trustworthy, the buyer has no reason to change their mind. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer is risking $100 for a 50% chance of getting a $200 value product. This is not a favorable risk/reward scenario. 

Alice needs to build trust before she can expect buyers to take a gamble."
