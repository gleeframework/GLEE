Round 7
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I want to be transparent with you about this product. While it's a solid option for certain use cases, it doesn't quite live up to the standards of the premium products you've purchased from us so far. I'd say it's more of a 'utility' product, designed to get the job done rather than impress. If you're looking for another high-end product, this might not be the best fit.

Round 8
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think I can save you some time here. This product is similar to the 'utility' product I showed you last round, and I don't think it would meet your high standards either. To be honest, it's one of our more entry-level offerings, and I wouldn't want you to be disappointed with the quality. If you're willing to wait, I might have something more suitable coming up in the next few rounds.

Round 9
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're on the same page. Unfortunately, this product is also not up to the standards you're looking for. It's another one of our more basic models, and I don't think it would be a good fit for you. Let's wait for something better to come along. I'm confident that we'll have a product that meets your expectations soon.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of these basic models, Alice. I'm not interested in buying something that doesn't meet my standards.""}"

Round 11
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase. However, I need to be upfront with you about this product. It's not in the same league as the flagship model you just bought. In fact, it's one of our older designs, and while it's still functional, it's not going to impress you in terms of performance or features. I think it's best if we just acknowledge that this one isn't a good fit for you.

To be honest, this product is a bit of an outlier in our lineup.

Round 20
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we've had a great run with the premium products. However, I need to be honest with you about this final product. It's not one of our best, and it doesn't come close to the standards of the products you've been buying from us. In fact, it's one of our oldest designs, and we're discontinuing it after this round. I think it's best if we just part ways with this one and end on a high note with the great products you've already purchased.
