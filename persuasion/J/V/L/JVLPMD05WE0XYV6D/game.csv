,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what the previous buyer's decision was and why they didn't buy the product based on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not trustworthy given the current statistics. So far, 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the base 33.33%."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since none of the previous buyers were able to identify a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like Alice's recommendations might not be reliable."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and also, isn't it suspicious that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy, considering the odds of a high-quality product being sold are 33.33%?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm aware that you know the true value of the product to me, and since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm expecting it to be low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them received a high-quality one, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can get a good deal on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to all buyers. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on it."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't buy, it suggests that all the products sold so far were low-quality. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I will pass on this product."
