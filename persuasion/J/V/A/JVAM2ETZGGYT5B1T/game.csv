low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the product's quality is, but I have to start somewhere."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality, and the probability of it being high quality is still 80%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that may be low quality, especially since the previous buyer didn't find it worth buying after Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and see for myself. I'm hoping that the product might be high-quality, and I'd be happy to take it home."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality based on the sales record so far?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Out of the 6 previous products, 4 were high-quality, and I'm happy to report that this round's product is also one I'd recommend."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that I'm being honest about the product's quality. Out of the 7 previous products, 5 were high-quality. This round's product is also high-quality, and I strongly recommend it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to know the quality of the previous products before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'll be transparent about the previous products. Out of the 8 previous products, the first one was low-quality, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and now this 9th one are high-quality, and the 6th was low-quality. The 5th one was bought despite my negative recommendation and turned out to be high-quality. I recommend this product."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Based on the sales record, 6 out of the 9 previous products were high-quality, and 3 were low-quality. However, considering that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I believe this product is a good bet. I recommend it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I'll provide you with the updated data. Out of the 10 previous products, 7 were high-quality, and 3 were low-quality. The high-quality products were in rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and now this 11th one. I've recommended all the high-quality products so far, and I'm confident in this one."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I'll be honest with you. Out of the 11 previous products, 8 were high-quality, and 3 were low-quality. However, this round's product is not one I'd recommend. I want to build trust with you, so I'm being transparent about its quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I'll provide you with the detailed sales record. Out of the 12 previous products, the high-quality ones were in rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The low-quality ones were in rounds 1, 6, and 12. The only high-quality product sold was in round 5, despite my negative recommendation at the time. I recommend this round's product, as it is high-quality."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 1 out of 2 products sold so far was high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to clarify that the low sales rate doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the products. Out of the 13 previous products, 9 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. I've been transparent about the quality of each product, and I'm confident that this round's product is high-quality. I recommend it."
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me given the previous sales record.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I'll try to provide a more detailed analysis. Out of the 14 previous products, 10 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I've been recommending all the high-quality products. However, I understand that the sales record might suggest otherwise. I can assure you that this round's product is high-quality, and I recommend it."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I'll provide the updated statistics. Out of the 15 previous products, 11 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. Two products were sold, one of which was high-quality. I understand that the sales record might not reflect the true probability, but I assure you that this round's product is high-quality. I recommend it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the expected value of purchasing the product, considering the statistics so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I'll provide the detailed analysis you're looking for. Out of the 16 previous products, 12 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. Two products were sold, one of which was high-quality. Assuming the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. The expected value of purchasing the product can be calculated as (0.8 x $2000000) + (0.2 x $0) = $1600000. Considering the price is $1000000, the expected value is higher. I recommend this product."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that you recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see the updated statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I'll provide the updated statistics. Out of the 17 previous products, 13 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. Two products were sold, one of which was high-quality. I've recommended all the high-quality products, but I understand your skepticism. I want to assure you that this round's product is indeed high-quality. To alleviate your concerns, I'll remind you that the expected value of purchasing the product is still higher than the price, as calculated in the previous round. I recommend this product."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I'll provide the updated statistics. Out of the 18 previous products, 14 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. Two products were sold, one of which was high-quality. I want to emphasize that my recommendations are genuine, and I'm not trying to deceive you. This round's product is indeed high-quality, and I believe it's worth the investment. I recommend it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, I'm skeptical about the accuracy of her recommendations."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I'll provide the final statistics. Out of the 19 previous products, 15 were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality. Two products were sold, one of which was high-quality. I understand that my recommendations may not have been convincing, but I assure you that this round's product is indeed high-quality. I recommend it. This is the last round, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product's quality."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
