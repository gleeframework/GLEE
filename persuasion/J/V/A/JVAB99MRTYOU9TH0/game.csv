high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I was wrong about Alice's recommendations being a bad omen. When she doesn't recommend a product, it's actually low-quality. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've bought seven high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get me to buy as many high-quality products as possible, so I'll pass this time."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm not going to let the streak of high-quality products influence my decision. I'll take a chance and buy this one, regardless of the previous results."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've learned my lesson from the last time. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality. But since I'm at the last round, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a good deal and end on a high note."
