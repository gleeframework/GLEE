```"
"Bob's message: Given that you're no longer assuring me of the product's high quality and considering the significant difference in value to me between a high-quality and low-quality product, I'll pass on this one to avoid the risk of it being low-quality and worth $0 to me.

```"
"Bob's message: Although you believe this one is of high quality, without a guarantee as before, the risk remains that it could be low-quality and worth $0 to me. Given that the potential loss ($1000000) outweighs the potential additional gain ($250000) compared to the cost, I'll pass on this one as well.

```"
"Bob's message: Although you mention it has a good chance of being high-quality and reference my previous experience, the fact remains that you're not guaranteeing its quality as you did in Rounds 1 and 2.

```"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but without knowing the product's quality, even a lower price doesn't change the fundamental risk.
