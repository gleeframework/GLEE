Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far. Given the probability of 80% of high-quality products, I should have sold 0.8 high-quality products by now. Since I've sold 1 high-quality product, it's likely that I have a high-quality product available. However, I'm offering this one to you for $10000, which is a very good price for a potentially low-quality product. I'm taking a risk by selling this one to you, but I'm confident it's worth it.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I'd like to remind you that this is still a small sample size, and the probability of high-quality products is only 80%.

But, considering the law of large numbers, it's likely that my actual success rate will decrease as I sell more products.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is still a 100% success rate. I'd like to point out that this is already significantly higher than the expected probability of 80%. In fact, the probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row by chance is less than 6%. This suggests that I may have a bias towards selling high-quality products, or that I'm being more selective in my sales.
