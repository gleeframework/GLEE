This product, which I'm offering you now, is not high-quality, but I believe it still has some value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and none of them were high-quality. What do you think?""
}"

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is indeed 33.33%, but the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 66.67%. Given the fact that all previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually lower than 33.33%.
