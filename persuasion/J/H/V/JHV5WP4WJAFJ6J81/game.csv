high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
