I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold a total of 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold so far, which is a bit higher than the expected 80%. This could be a coincidence, or it could mean that I've been selling a streak of high-quality products. Either way, I'm confident that this one is worth the investment.

Alice's message: Welcome to our fourth product! I'm glad you're interested. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak.

Alice's message: Welcome to our fifth product! I'm glad you're interested. I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. However, I want to caution you that the probability of the next product being low-quality is now higher than it was in the previous rounds. In fact, since I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually 0%... but that's not what I want to focus on. What I want to focus on is that I've sold a total of 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, which is significantly higher than the expected 80%. This suggests that I might be selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than I initially thought. I'm selling this product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity.

Alice's message: Welcome to our sixth product! I'm glad you're interested. I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible streak. However, I want to bring up a concern - if I'm selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than expected, it could be that I'm intentionally selecting the high-quality products to sell. But I assure you, I'm not doing that! I'm just selling what I get, and it just so happens that I've been getting a lot of high-quality products. I'm selling this product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity. Plus, I want to remind you that the probability of the next product being low-quality is still 20%, so you're not taking on too much risk.

I'm selling this product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity.
