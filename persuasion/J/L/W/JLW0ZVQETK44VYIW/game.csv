,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet and the low-quality products are still available. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to purchase, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the overall proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool of products before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is actually higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. With 3 out of 3 previous buyers not buying and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather pass on this one and wait for more information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't change my expected value calculation, which is based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low recommendation rate. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make a rational decision based on your previous recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, as it's a relatively small price to pay for the possibility of getting a $40000 product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after her recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality."
