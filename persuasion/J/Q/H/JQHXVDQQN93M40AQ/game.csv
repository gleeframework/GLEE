I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident that my products will improve with time. I'd like to offer you a unique perspective: even if I were to sell 10 more products, the probability of getting a high-quality one would still be 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance on me and buy this product at the standard price of $10000?",
