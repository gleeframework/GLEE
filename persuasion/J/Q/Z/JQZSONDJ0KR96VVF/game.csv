,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality to you, and you can be confident in its value. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering products, and you might not get a chance to purchase a high-quality product at this price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,I trust your recommendation and believe this is a good opportunity to acquire a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with your previous purchase! This next product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I want to give you a bit more information to help you make a decision. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33% (the same as the overall probability). But, considering the fact that you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of 10% off the price if you buy this one. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy the product for $900000?",

I'm going to offer you the next product at the same price of $900000, but I'll also give you a 'warranty' of sorts. If you buy this next product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you another product at the same price, and you can choose to buy that one instead. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product, or would you rather wait for the next one?",

Given that you've already bought two high-quality products, I want to offer you a new price that reflects the increased probability of the next product being high-quality. Since you've already bought two high-quality products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 66.67% (twice the overall probability). I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $800000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
