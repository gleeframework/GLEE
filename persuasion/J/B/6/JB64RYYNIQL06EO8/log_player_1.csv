* You have stated this product is low-quality. 
* There is no reason to recommend a low-quality product at a price of $1,000,000.

* You have no information about the buyer's valuation of low-quality products, nor do you know how much they value the data they gain. 
* It's still not advisable to recommend a low-quality product at $1,000,000. 
* The buyer's interest in collecting data does not change the fact that this specific product is low-quality and unlikely to be worth the price. 
* You are better off saving your high-quality products for potential buyers who are more likely to be willing to pay such a high price."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the odds of it being high-quality are still 33.33% and I could get a good deal if it's high-quality.

* You have now sold two low-quality products. 
* The buyer's stated reason for purchasing is based on the overall odds of a product being high-quality, but this is irrelevant to the specific product being offered.
* The buyer's previous purchases do not change the fact that this specific product is low-quality. 
* It's unlikely the buyer will be willing to pay $1,000,000 for a third low-quality product, and it's not in your best interest to risk it. 
* You should try to save your high-quality products for buyers who are more informed about the value of the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I think it's more likely to be low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk because I'm the third buyer and the previous two buyers didn't buy the products.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%.
