,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll wait for a more promising opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low quality. Since you're not recommending this one either, I'm skeptical about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of sales history and your recommendation. I'm not sure if this is a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products recommended to them were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining stock."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
