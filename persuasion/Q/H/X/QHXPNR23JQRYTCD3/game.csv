low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and since she's not recommending it, I think there's a higher chance it's low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations have been unhelpful, so I'm going to make a decision based on the statistics. With 5 buyers having passed on the product and 0 high-quality products sold, it's possible that all the remaining products are low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the only high-quality one left."

,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products.
