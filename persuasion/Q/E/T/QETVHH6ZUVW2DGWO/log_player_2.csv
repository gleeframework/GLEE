Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the probability calculation. The probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80% because the probability is based on the initial distribution of high-quality and low-quality products, not on the observed sales record. The sales record is simply a reflection of this underlying probability. Think of it as a coin flip: the probability of heads (high-quality) is still 80%, regardless of the sequence of flips.
