I'm willing to sell it to you today, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still cautious and would like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,3,"I see you're still hesitant. Let me make it clear that I'm not just offering any product, but a high-quality one that's worth $3000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to move on to the next product, and I'll have to start charging the full price of $1500000 for high-quality products. You'll be saving $500000 by buying now.

I know it may seem like a bad deal, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Think of it as an investment in our relationship. If you buy this product, I'll be more likely to offer you better deals in the future. Plus, you'll be supporting a business that's committed to providing value to its customers.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time opportunity to get a product from me at a price that's significantly lower than its actual value. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to charge you the full price of $1000000 for any future high-quality products. This product may be worth $0 to you, but it's a chance to save $1000000 that you can use to acquire a high-quality product later. Think of it as a 'get out of jail free' card.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not convinced that the potential savings of $1000000 is worth buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass and wait for a product that's actually valuable to me.,no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your perspective, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you high-quality products at $1000000 if you're not willing to take advantage of the low-quality products at the same price. If you don't buy this product, I'll start selling the high-quality products at the full price of $3000000, and you'll be missing out on a great opportunity to acquire one at a discount. You can either buy this low-quality product for $1000000 or risk paying $2000000 more for a high-quality product later.",

That's two high-quality products for $1000000 each, a total value of $6000000. If you don't take this offer, I'll sell the second high-quality product at the full price of $3000000, and you'll be missing out on a great deal.",

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Now, I know you're thinking that you've already got a great deal with the two high-quality products, and you might be tempted to pass on this low-quality product. But think about it this way: you've already saved $1500000 compared to buying two high-quality products at the full price. This low-quality product is essentially free to you, and you can consider it a bonus. It's a chance to get something for nothing, and I'm willing to give it to you for $1000000. It's a no-brainer.",
