}"

However, I'm willing to sell it to you at a discounted price of $5000. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate to you that not all products are created equal, and I want to give you a chance to experience the difference. Plus, you have the veto option from the previous round, so you can always reject a future low-quality product. What do you say?""
}"

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is the same price I offered in Round 2. However, this time I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, you'll get a 'double-or-nothing' option for the next round.

}"

If you buy this product, I'll give you the option to keep it and the product from Round 4, and you can return the product from Round 6. This way, you'll have two high-quality products, and the product from Round 6 will be essentially free. What do you say?""
