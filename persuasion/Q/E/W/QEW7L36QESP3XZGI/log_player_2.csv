However, I will say that I'm slightly more enthusiastic about this one than the previous one. That being said, I don't want to sway your decision unfairly, so I'll leave it up to you to decide. Is $10000 a risk you're willing to take for a potential high-quality product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if the similarity is just a coincidence, and I don't want to spend another $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I completely understand your skepticism.
