low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality based on your past recommendations. Since 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I could potentially get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm a bit skeptical after hearing your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. This suggests that the product is likely low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk since the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm also considering that I'm the 6th buyer and so far, no high-quality products have been sold, which might indicate that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to be the exception."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in its quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. Since 6 out of 6 buyers have rejected the product, it's likely that all 6 products were low quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high quality is 33.33% (1 - 66.67%). I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
