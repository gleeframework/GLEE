,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were recommended and both turned out to be low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended 3 products to previous buyers, and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the products you've recommended so far may have been low quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make me a happy buyer. If it's high-quality, I'll be out $1000000, but at least I'll be able to learn from the experience and update my strategy for future purchases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation.

I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, is it because you think it's low quality? I'm hesitant to spend $1000000 on a product that might be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm going to pass. I'm assuming that if you had a good chance of recommending a high-quality product, you would have done so by now, given that 5 buyers have already purchased."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous 5 buyers who bought the product, including how many high-quality products they got and how many low-quality products they got. This will help me make a more informed decision for my purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been presented with the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. Therefore, I'm going to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as this might influence my decision for future products."
