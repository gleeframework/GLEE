,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I'm glad you took the chance on the previous products.

I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I'd like to offer a 'certified pre-owned' guarantee, which includes a thorough inspection and a 1-year warranty.

I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, which means the last two products were of lower quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not as good as the ones I've sold previously. I'm offering it to you for $8000, but I'll throw in a'make-good' offer: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied, and I'll also give you a free product of your choice from my next batch. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. However, considering the product is of low quality and I have a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product anyway, I don't think the 'make-good' offer is enough to justify the purchase, especially since the next batch's quality is uncertain. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
