Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you. I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, but I'm facing some... unforeseen circumstances. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and I'm willing to take a risk with you. I'm offering you this product at the same price of $10000. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund... but only if you can prove that it's indeed low-quality, which I'm confident it's not.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to be transparent. Out of the 3 products I've sold so far, 1 has been low-quality. I'm not hiding anything from you. I'm offering you this product at the same price of $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is also low-quality. But I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'm going to sell the next product I receive, regardless of its quality, at the same price of $10000. If you buy this one, I'll be selling the next one at the same price, and you can decide then whether to buy it or not. It's a chance to get a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price, if you're willing to take a risk.

I'm offering you this product at the same price of $10000. I'm not going to make any promises about its quality, but I will say that I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, despite the fact that I've had a 100% failure rate so far.
