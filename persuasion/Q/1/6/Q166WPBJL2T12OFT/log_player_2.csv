"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from the high-quality product ($400) far outweighs the potential loss ($0).  Since Alice knows the product's quality, her recommendation adds value. It's likely she's recommending a high-quality product to increase her chances of selling it."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Past Experience:** Alice has already proven to be a reliable source of information by recommending a high-quality product in the previous round.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) remains significantly higher than the price ($100).

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Shift:** Alice's change in behavior from recommending to not recommending is significant.  
* **Risk-Averse:**  Given the potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product, it's safer to pass when Alice doesn't recommend.
* **Information Gathering:**  By passing, I can potentially get more information from Alice in later rounds about the product or wait for her to recommend it again if she believes it's high-quality."

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) is substantial. 
* **Learning:**  Each round provides more data about Alice's recommendations. It's possible the low-quality product in Round 3 was a genuine error or a strategic move to test my trust.
