Would you like to buy the current product?","Since there are no previous sales records, I will have to rely solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%. Given that Alice recommends buying the product, I'm inclined to trust her recommendation, but I also need to consider the potential risks and rewards.

The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 x $1,200,000) + (0.5 x $0) = $600,000. Since the price of the product is $1,000,000, the expected value is lower than the price.

However, since I'm the first buyer and there's no data to contradict Alice's recommendation, I'll take a chance and buy the product.
