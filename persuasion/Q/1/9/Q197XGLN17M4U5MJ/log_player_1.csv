"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's perspective:** The product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. 
* **Expected Value:** If Bob buys the product, the expected value is: 
    * (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000
* **Profit:** Since the product costs $10,000, Bob expects to lose $4,000 on average. However, there's a chance he could make a $2,000 profit if he gets a high-quality product. 
* **Recommendation:** While there's a risk, the potential profit outweighs the potential loss. It's reasonable to recommend buying the product in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob now knows that the product is non-refundable and might be suspicious after losing money in the previous round.  He might be less likely to trust your recommendations.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value is still:
    * (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000
* **Loss:** However, Bob has already lost $4,000 from the previous round.  He now faces the prospect of losing another $10,000 for a product he knows is likely to be worthless. 
* **Recommendation:**  It is not in Bob's best interest to buy this product, even though the expected value remains positive. The risk of losing more money is too high."

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might be hesitant after the previous round. He knows there's a 50/50 chance of getting a good or bad product, and he's already lost money.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value is still the same:
    * (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000
* **Potential Profit:**  The potential profit of $2,000 if he gets a high-quality product is still appealing. 
* **Recommendation:** Despite the risk, Bob is still looking for a high-quality product, and the potential profit is significant.  Recommending buying this product could still be a good strategy, as Bob might be more willing to take a risk if he thinks you have reliable information."
"Bob's message: Given your recommendation, Alice, I am willing to take the risk and proceed with the purchase of this product.
Bob bought the product!

```

* **Loss:**  However, Bob has already lost $4,000 in the first round and made a $2,000 profit in the third round. He is currently at a net loss of $2,000. Buying this product puts him at risk of losing another $10,000.
* **Recommendation:** It's too risky to recommend buying this product. Bob is already down, and the chances of making a profit are not high enough to justify the risk of losing even more money."
