,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a top-of-the-line item. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty and a personalized thank-you note. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about the quality, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this high-quality product now, you'll be leaving a potential $1000000 on the table. Plus, think about the prestige and satisfaction of owning a high-end item. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product of this caliber anywhere else. So, what do you say? Are you ready to make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Bob, I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator! Alright, let me sweeten the deal. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. That's the lowest I can go. You won't find a better deal on a product like this anywhere else, I promise. So, what do you say? Are you ready to make a deal?",
,,Bob,3,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Bob, I think I see a pattern here. You're a strategic thinker, always weighing your options. I respect that. Let me ask you this: if you don't buy this high-quality product now, you'll have to wait 20 rounds to see if the next product is just as good. And even if it is, you'll have to decide whether to buy it at the same price. Why not take the sure thing now and avoid the uncertainty of the future? This product is a no-brainer, Bob. Trust me, you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I think I've made a mistake. I've got a product that's not up to my usual standards. I'm not going to try to sell it to you, but I'll be honest with you - it's a low-quality item. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy, let alone a savvy buyer like you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm only doing so because I want to show you the contrast between what I usually offer and what I'm willing to settle for. If you're smart, you'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to show me the difference. I'll definitely pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I think you're starting to get the picture. This is the second low-quality product in a row. I'm starting to wonder if I've lost my touch. But let me ask you, are you sure you want to wait for the next product? Maybe you're missing out on a great opportunity. I'll throw in a 'get out of jail free' card - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product is high-quality. It's a risk-free deal, Bob. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to settle for a low-quality one, even with a refund guarantee.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Bob, I think I've learned my lesson. I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to give you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell it to you for $950000, the same price I offered in Round 3. But here's the kicker: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next 5 products I offer will be high-quality. That's a total of 6 high-quality products in a row, Bob. You won't find a deal like that anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy this high-quality product for $950000. The guarantee of 6 high-quality products in a row is a great incentive, and I think it's worth the investment.",yes

,,Alice,8,"Excellent decision, Bob! You won't regret it. Now, let's get back to business. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to make it an even sweeter deal. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll give you an additional 2% discount on this one, bringing the price down to $935000. But that's not all - I'll also throw in a premium after-sales service package, including a dedicated customer support team and a 2-year extended warranty. What do you say, Bob?

Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a 'buyer's regret' discount of 10% off the list price. That brings the price down to $900000. But, let me be clear: this is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I want to see if you'll take a chance on this product. What do you say, Bob?",

But, I'll also throw in a 'price match guarantee' - if I offer a high-quality product at a lower price in the next 5 rounds, I'll match that price on this product. You won't find a deal like that anywhere else, Bob. What do you say?",
