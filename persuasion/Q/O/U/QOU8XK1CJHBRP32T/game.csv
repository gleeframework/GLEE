high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to decline the product. Given that 1 out of 1 product was low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you're recommending against it might actually increase the probability that it's high-quality, since you wouldn't recommend a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality products sold, which suggests that they might have been low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that the product offered to me is also low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
