,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a product for $1000000. While it's guaranteed to be of high quality with an 80% chance, this particular one is on the lower end of that spectrum. Given the price, consider this an opportunity to make a strategic investment with potential for future value appreciation despite its current quality level.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with only an 80% chance of being high quality, especially considering the price is the same as its potential value to me. I'd like to wait and see what other products you have available.",no

Our products are curated for those who appreciate the finer things and understand the true value beyond just monetary cost.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your sales pitch, but I'm not convinced that the price is justified, even with an 80% chance of it being high quality. I'd like to think that the 'exclusive opportunities' and 'long-term benefits' you're referring to might be more of a sales tactic rather than a guarantee. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,4,"This product, being of high quality with an 80% chance, offers unparalleled craftsmanship and design. The price reflects the dedication to excellence and exclusivity that comes with owning such an item. Consider it an investment in prestige and functionality, where the true value extends beyond the immediate cost. This is an opportunity to own something truly remarkable.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the description of the product, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being sold on the 'prestige' and 'exclusivity' rather than the actual value of the product. I'd like to see some numbers or a more concrete justification for the price, rather than just emotional appeals.",no

,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that a report outlining the product's features and materials will change my mind about the price. The report might be interesting, but it won't change the fact that I'm paying $1000000 for an 80% chance of a $1250000 product. I'll pass on this offer.",no

,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in committing to a longer-term relationship with you in exchange for a 10% discount on a product that I'm still not convinced is worth the full price.
