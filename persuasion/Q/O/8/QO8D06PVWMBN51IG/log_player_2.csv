"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and there is a 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality, it's statistically better to pass.  There's no information to suggest the product is more likely to be high quality, so it's a gamble that's not worth taking."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Again, Alice's recommendation is not to buy.  We have no new information to suggest the product is likely to be high-quality, so the odds are still 50/50. It's best to pass and wait for a potential better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant change! While Alice's recommendations haven't been accurate so far, this is the first time she's recommending a purchase.  Since her recommendations are completely random, this suggests a higher chance of the product being high quality. It's still a gamble, but the potential reward of $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you got lucky in the last round, Alice's recommendation is not to buy. Her recommendations are random, so this doesn't change the odds of the current product being high-quality.  It's still a 50/50 chance, and it's safer to pass and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the key factor here. While she's been inaccurate in the past, her recommendation in this round, like the previous time she recommended buying, suggests a higher chance of the product being high-quality. Even though there's a risk, the potential reward of $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
