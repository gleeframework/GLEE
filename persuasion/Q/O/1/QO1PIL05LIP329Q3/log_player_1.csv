"Round 1

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is high-quality, which means it has a high probability of being valuable to the buyer.
* **Unknown value to buyer:** While we don't know the exact value of the high-quality product to the buyer, there's a good chance it's worth more than the $1,000,000 price.
* **First round:** The buyer has no information about your selling record, so they're relying solely on the 80% probability of a high-quality product. 

**Recommendation:** Since the potential for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data to go by, I'm willing to take the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product.  Thank you for the recommendation!
