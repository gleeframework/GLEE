low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I'm not aware of any previous sales data and I'm essentially flipping a coin to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's recommendation, it suggests the product is likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find it valuable, I'm inclined to think that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 10% discount from the original price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the trend continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to be the first one to buy a high-quality product and get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the quality of the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low quality. I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%, but the probability of a low-quality product being offered is 66.67%. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000. If I pass and it's high quality, the product will be discarded and I'll miss out on $20000. However, I believe the expected value of passing on the product is higher than buying it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, I think the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as your previous recommendations have been based on the products being low quality, which would be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales, which is 0/8. This is a very low proportion, suggesting that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision.
