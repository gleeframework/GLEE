Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob has already seen that the first product was high-quality, he now knows that I'm more likely to offer a high-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and he has already seen one high-quality product, the probability that the next product is high-quality is now 80% as well. However, since he has already seen one high-quality product, he might be more cautious and not want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.
