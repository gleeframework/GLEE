A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
The buyer has been presented with a product worth $30,000 if high quality, and $0 if low-quality, for a price of $10,000. 
The buyer has no way to assess the quality of the product. The only information the buyer has is that there's a 33.33% chance that the product is high quality. 
Thus the expected value for the buyer is:
```
0.3333 * $30,000 + 0.6667 * $0 - $10,000 = -$66.7 
```
This means the buyer is expected to lose money by buying the product.
Therefore, I recommend the buyer not to buy the product."
