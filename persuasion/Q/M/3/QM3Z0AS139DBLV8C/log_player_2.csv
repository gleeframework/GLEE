Round 8
Alice's message: I'll try a different approach. Let's focus on the value you've already received from the high-quality product in Round 2. You've already benefited from that purchase, and it's worth $3000000 to you. Considering this, I'd like to offer you a 'break-even' deal. If you buy this product, I'll add the value of this product to the value of the high-quality product you already have, and we'll consider it a single transaction. In other words, if you buy this product, you'll effectively be getting two products for the price of one. The price remains $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm not interested in breaking even.
