**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We only know that one buyer purchased a high-quality product before us.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation carries some weight. While we don't know her strategy, she has access to the product's true quality and is likely trying to maximize her sales. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) is substantial.

**Therefore, taking the risk and purchasing the product seems like the best option based on the available information.**"
