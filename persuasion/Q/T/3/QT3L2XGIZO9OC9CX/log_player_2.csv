**Reasoning:**

Even though the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of being low quality), the fact that Alice recommended this product is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation implies that this is likely a high-quality product.  It's worth taking a chance at this point, considering the potential reward outweighs the risk."
