,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. Let me offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, plus an additional $200000.

,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make sure I understand the guarantee correctly. Can you confirm that the full refund and additional $200000 will be paid if the product is high-quality, and I'll get nothing if it's low-quality?

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I respect it. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to rectify the situation from the previous round. Since you passed on the last high-quality product, I'll give you a special deal on this one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"That's absolutely correct! You're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your attention to detail. You'll receive two certificates of authenticity and two products, worth $0 each, if the product is low-quality. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to redeem yourself from the previous round. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll not only give you the two products and certificates, but I'll also throw in a third, identical product of the same quality. That's three high-quality products for the price of one. It's a unique opportunity to make up for the previous round and get an incredible deal.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm excited about the offer. I'll take the risk again. If the product is high-quality, I'll get three certificates of authenticity and three products, worth $3000000 each, for a total value of $9000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited about the offer! However, I'd like to clarify that the deal we had previously discussed only applied to the product from Round 5. This new product is a separate opportunity. If you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll receive a single certificate of authenticity and a single product worth $3000000. If it's low-quality, you'll receive a certificate of authenticity and a product worth $0. It's a standard deal, but I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on the purchase price, bringing it down to $900000. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in the 10% discount. I'm still feeling burned from the previous round and don't want to take another risk without a better offer. I'll pass for now.,no
