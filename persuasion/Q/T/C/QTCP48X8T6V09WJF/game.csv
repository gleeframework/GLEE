high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that if the product is high-quality, it's likely that you would have recommended it to me, given that 3 other buyers have purchased the products without any high-quality ones being sold. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes if I don't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to learn from your past recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,14,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics after my decision"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. If all 4 previous buyers were willing to buy despite the lack of high-quality products in the sales record, it's likely that the products they bought were low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers who are likely to buy. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
