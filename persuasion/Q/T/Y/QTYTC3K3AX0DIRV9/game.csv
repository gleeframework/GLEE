high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product quality distribution."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not going to buy it yet. I want to see the statistics first. Can you tell me how many products you have in stock?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the chance that it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 0, which suggests a lower likelihood of the product being high-quality. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that might be more indicative of the product's quality."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous products were low-quality, and you recommended I buy this one. I think it's likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
