high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics. If I understand correctly, with 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me given the current sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is low-quality, and she wants to get rid of it. If I buy it, it will likely be a low-quality product, which is not worth $100 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Your recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that you've already sold 2 low-quality products, so I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high quality. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what is the probability of a product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the current product is low-quality.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low, and I'm not confident that this product is worth $100. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian and think there might be a chance it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which might give me a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
