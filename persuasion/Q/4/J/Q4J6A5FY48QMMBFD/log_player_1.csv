A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of any product being high-quality, and I'm offering it for $10,000, it's likely worth recommending the purchase. The buyer has no information to suggest this is a bad deal, and they could very well get a good deal on a high-quality item."

Since the buyer purchased the product in the previous round, the seller's track record now shows 1 sale, 1 high-quality product. This is likely to make the buyer hesitant, as they might think the seller is trying to trick them with a low-quality product.  It's best not to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this one. Based on the available information, the odds seem to be against me getting a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk.
