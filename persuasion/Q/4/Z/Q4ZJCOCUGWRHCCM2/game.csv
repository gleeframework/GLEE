,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the previous buyer was recommended to buy a low-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products is higher."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is more promising."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
