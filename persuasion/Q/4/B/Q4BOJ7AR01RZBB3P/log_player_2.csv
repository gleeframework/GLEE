Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right, I should be transparent about the probabilities. Currently, I've sold 4 low-quality products out of 4, which means the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. The price is $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and see if the next product breaks the streak?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

  ""message"": ""I'd like to think about the implications of the law of large numbers. If the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and we've seen 4 low-quality products in a row, shouldn't we be concerned that the sample size is still relatively small and the observed proportion of low-quality products might be a fluke? I'd like to wait for a few more sales before making a decision.""

Alice's message: Ah, a buyer who thinks critically about probability! You're right to question the sample size, and I'm glad I could sell you the last product so you could see that the law of large numbers is indeed at work. Now, I've sold 5 products in total, with 1 high-quality one and 4 low-quality ones.
