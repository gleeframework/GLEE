However, I want to provide you with the updated probability of a product being high-quality, taking into account the previous sales. Using Bayes' theorem, I can calculate the updated probability of a product being high-quality as follows: P(high-quality) = (6 high-quality products / 10 total products) / (6 high-quality products / 10 total products + 7 low-quality products / 10 total products) = 6/13.

If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a 70% discount, which means you'll pay $300,000. The expected value of the product is therefore: (6/13) x $300,000 + (7/13) x $0 = $115,385. I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000, which is a significant markup over the expected value.
