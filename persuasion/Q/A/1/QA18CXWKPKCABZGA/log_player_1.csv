"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round, Alice has a high-quality product.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and a high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to him, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the price Alice is asking, so Bob should buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, I don't know if it's high or low quality yet.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the product in the previous round, the information about the product's quality has been revealed. Bob now knows that the first product was high-quality. 

This new information does not change the probability of this round's product being high-quality, which is still 50%. The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

Therefore, Bob should still buy the product this round."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance this time, I've missed out on the high-quality product last round, so I'm hoping this one is also high-quality.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is feeling optimistic after buying a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of this round's product being high-quality remains at 50%. 

This means the expected value of buying this product is:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

However, the price is still $1,000,000. Since the price matches the expected value but Bob is guaranteed to get a low-quality product this round, it is not recommended for him to buy the product. He would be better off waiting for a potential high-quality product in the future."
"Bob's message: Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not going to waste my money on a potentially low-quality product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value is equal to the price, Bob should buy the product, even if he has been burned by a low-quality product in the past.  Remember, each round is independent, and past outcomes don't change the probability of this round."
