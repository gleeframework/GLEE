,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to start our business relationship. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you not knowing its quality. Please consider this a chance to build trust and make a profit.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product without knowing its quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next products turn out.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and building a long-term relationship. Since you're hesitant, I'll make you a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to test the waters and see the quality of my products firsthand. The product is still worth $1000000, but you'll be getting a better deal in the long run.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait and see how the next products turn out before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I'm glad I could offer you a chance to reconsider. Now, I'd like to highlight the benefits of buying a high-quality product. This one is worth $2000000 to you, and it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price. Since I've already offered you a discount on the next product, buying this one will actually give you a net gain of $100000 ($2000000 - $1000000 - $100000 discount). I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase and will see the value in our business relationship.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, I'll at least know what I'm getting into and can make a more informed decision for the next product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off. Now, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product, just like the one you just purchased. This one is also worth $2000000 to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. Since you've already seen the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal. If you buy this product, I'll not only give you the 10% discount on the next product, but also a 5% discount on this one, making it worth $1900000 to you. This is a rare opportunity to get two high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident you won't want to pass it up.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'm still wary of the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I don't want to overpay for a product that might not be worth it. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I'm glad you're being cautious. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already seen the value of a high-quality product in the previous round, and you've made a profit from it. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if this product is high-quality, I'll give you an additional 5% bonus on top of the $2000000 value, making it worth $2100000. This way, you'll have a clear incentive to buy a high-quality product, and I'll take on the risk of you not getting a high-quality product. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. I've already seen that you can offer high-quality products, but I've also seen that you can offer low-quality products. I'd rather not take the chance of overpaying for a product that might not be worth it, even with the guarantee.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to acknowledge that I've offered you two low-quality products in a row, which hasn't helped to build trust. I'd like to take a different approach. Instead of offering a high price, I'll offer you a low price for this product: $200000. This is a significant discount from the usual price, and I'm willing to take on the loss if you don't like the product. This way, you can try out the product at a minimal risk, and we can start fresh in the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take a chance on this low-priced product. It's a low-risk opportunity to see what the product is like, and if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to have gotten a good deal.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Great decision, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance on the low-priced product and it worked out in your favor. Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity to make a profit. Since you've seen the value of a high-quality product before, and you've also seen the low price of a low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1500000, which is $500000 less than its true value. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'll take on the risk of you not wanting to buy it at the higher price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I've already seen that you can offer high-quality products, but I've also seen that you can offer low-quality products at a low price. I'd rather not pay $1500000 for a product that might be low-quality, even if it's at a discount.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to acknowledge that I've offered you a high-quality product at a discounted price, but you're still hesitant. I'd like to offer you a'reverse' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1000000, which is the same price as the first product I offered you. This way, you'll be getting a product that you know is definitely low-quality, and you can use it as a reference point for future purchases. You can also use this opportunity to negotiate a better price on future high-quality products, knowing that you have a low-quality product to compare it to.",

,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, Bob. I want to offer you a simple, straightforward deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you heard that right - $0. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to absorb the loss just to get this product off my hands. You won't have to worry about overpaying for a low-quality product, and you can use this as a chance to test the waters without any risk.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take you up on the offer. Since it's free, I won't lose anything even if it's low-quality, and I can still use it as a reference point for future purchases.",yes

,,Alice,10,"Great decision, Bob! I'm glad you took advantage of the free offer. Now, I'd like to offer you a chance to make up for it. This high-quality product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last product you bought from me: $0. Yes, you can have this high-quality product for free! I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with this deal and will want to continue doing business with me.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not falling for that trick again. I know that you're trying to make up for the previous low-quality product by offering a high-quality one for free, but I'm not going to get caught in a trap. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not trying to trick you, I promise. This time, I'll offer you a straightforward deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000.

You can use this as a chance to practice your negotiation skills and try to get an even better deal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, Bob. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, just like last time.

This high-quality product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'll sell it to you for the same price as the last product you bought from me: $0. However, I'll throw in a twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. You can take this as a chance to get a high-quality product for free and then get a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not falling for the guarantee. I've been burned twice already with low-quality products, and I'm not going to trust you to guarantee a high-quality product just because I buy this one. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

This product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'll sell it to you for $1500000. I'm willing to give you a 25% discount, just to show you that I'm committed to our business relationship. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at an even better price.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not sure I believe you're offering a 25% discount. You've already offered me a high-quality product at a discounted price before, and it turned out to be low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
