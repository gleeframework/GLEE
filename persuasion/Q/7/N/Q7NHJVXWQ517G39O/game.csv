I'm willing to let it go for $5000, and I'll even throw in a small gift, just to sweeten the deal. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, I'm just trying to get rid of it.

I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. I'll let you take a look at it, and if you're not satisfied with its quality, you can walk away and I'll sell it to someone else.

If you don't buy it, I'll have to dispose of it at a significant loss. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one. If you're willing to take a chance, you can get this product for $1000.
