high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Ahaha, you're a statistician, aren't you? We appreciate your diligence! You're right to question the sample size, and we're happy to provide more data. As of now, we've sold 5 high-quality products out of a total of 12 products offered. That's a 41.7% success rate. We're proud of our track record, and we're confident that this product will meet your expectations. We're offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. Will you take the chance to experience the benefits of this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to consider the probability of this product being high-quality based on the updated statistics. Given that 5 out of 12 products were high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is 41.7%. However, I'd like to calculate the expected value of buying this product. If it's high-quality, I'll get $4000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. So, the expected value is (0.417 * $4000000) + (0.583 * $0) = $1668000. Since the price is $1000000, I'll have to pass on this opportunity. I'd like to know the total number of buyers who have passed on the product so far.",no

However, we understand that the expected value might not be enough to convince you. We're offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. Will you take the chance to experience the benefits of this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate the confidence in your product, but I'd like to know the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, as well as the number of total products sold so far. The expected value calculation is indeed 800000, but I'd like to consider the probability of the product being high-quality based on the actual data.",no

,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your confidence in your product, but I'm a bit skeptical about this one. Given the 62.5% success rate, I'd expect a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold. The fact that you're offering a low-quality product to me, the 5th buyer, makes me think that there might be a pattern of low-quality products being held back until later. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
