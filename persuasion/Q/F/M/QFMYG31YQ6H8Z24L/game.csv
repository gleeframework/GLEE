,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior information to go by. I'll make a decision based on the 50/50 chance of the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that there might be a bias towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. I'd like to know if Alice has any explanation for her previous recommendations or if there's any additional information I can use to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that you recommended it makes me suspicious. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
