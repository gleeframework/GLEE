```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some data:

* **1 product sold:** The buyer purchased the previous product.
* **1 high-quality product sold:**  You revealed the previous product was high-quality.

This means the buyer now knows that you have a 100% track record of selling high-quality products. However, you know this round's product is low-quality. There is no way to benefit the buyer by recommending this product. It would be a loss for them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this product.  The fact that you're not recommending it makes me think it's more likely to be low quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk.

* **1 product sold:**  The first buyer purchased the product.
* **1 high-quality product sold:** The first product was revealed to be high-quality.
* **1 product not recommended:** You did not recommend the second product.

The buyer likely understands that you are being honest about the product quality.
