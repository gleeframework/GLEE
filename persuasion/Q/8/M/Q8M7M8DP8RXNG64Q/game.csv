,,Alice,1,"You're the first buyer of the day. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which might be worthless to you. But if you don't buy it, I'll just sell it to the next person, and you might miss out on a potentially valuable product.",

,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer of the day. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 so far. The first buyer passed on this product, which was also low-quality. This might suggest that the products I have are indeed more likely to be low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which might be worthless to you. But if you don't buy it, I might sell it to the next person, and you might miss out on a potentially valuable product.",

I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the lack of sales so far might be a red flag. If you buy it, you'll have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which might be worthless to you. But if you don't buy it, you might miss out on a potentially valuable product.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While the chance of a high-quality product remains, the lack of sales so far is concerning. I'll pass on this product for now and see if the trend changes with future buyers.",no

I've just sold a high-quality product, which means the next one might be a low-quality one. You now have more information about the distribution of products, and I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the fact that the last product was high-quality might make this one more likely to be low-quality.

,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your honesty and transparency about the recent sales, I'm going to pass on this product.
