,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob! But let me tell you, this product is truly exceptional. It's a game-changer. In fact, I'm so confident in its quality that I'm willing to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a personalized guarantee that it will increase your wealth by at least $500000 within the next year.
