high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get the first product out of the way so I can get more information about the quality distribution of the remaining products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought one high-quality product, so I'm not sure if the next one is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to see the outcome of this product before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Since I didn't buy the previous product and it turned out to be high-quality, I'm now more confident that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've now bought two high-quality products in a row, which is very unlikely. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%, or that Alice is trying to manipulate me. I'm going to be more cautious and pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've been burned twice by high-quality products in a row, but I still think the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, given the 80% probability. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me or that there's something fishy going on. I'm going to pass on this one and try to figure out what's going on."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Four high-quality products in a row is almost impossible, and I'm starting to suspect that the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one and try to gather more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to deceive me or that there's a bias in the selection process. Five high-quality products in a row is a statistical impossibility. I'm going to pass on this one and try to find a way to get more information about the true quality distribution of the products.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is either incredibly unlucky or is intentionally manipulating the outcome. Six high-quality products in a row is a statistical anomaly that can't be ignored. I'll pass on this one and try to find a way to break the streak.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is a statistical impossibility. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to deceive me or that there's a flaw in the game design. I'll pass on this one and try to find a way to end this game or get more information about the true nature of the products.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've been burned 7 times in a row, and each time it was a high-quality product. This is not possible under the stated 80% probability of high-quality products. I'm going to assume that the true probability of a high-quality product is actually 100%, and Alice is just trying to sell me all the high-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've already assumed that the true probability of a high-quality product is 100%, and I've been passed over 7 high-quality products in a row. I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, since I'm essentially guaranteed to get a high-quality product at this point."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I've already bought 8 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that the game is actually rigged in my favor. I'm not going to take any more risks and will pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've been passed over 8 high-quality products in a row, and I'm still not going to take the bait. I'm going to stick to my strategy of passing on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've been passed over 9 high-quality products in a row, and I'm still not convinced that I should buy. I'm going to keep passing and see if Alice will ever recommend a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Finally! Alice is recommending not to buy, which means this product is probably low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I was right about the last product being low-quality, but now I'm back to facing a recommendation to buy. I'm going to stick to my strategy of passing on the product, since I don't want to get stuck with another low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,I'm starting to feel like I'm in a never-ending loop of high-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can break the streak.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I've been passed over 11 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to lose hope. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get lucky and get a low-quality product for once."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Finally! Alice is recommending not to buy again, which means this product is probably low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it, and I'll be done with this game."
