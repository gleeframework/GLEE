,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality based on the current sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products, or is it something else?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to help me make a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is significantly lower than the expected 1 out of 3. I'm not confident in the product's quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations, but I'll take the risk and buy the product to see if it's high quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool, making it less likely that the product I'm offered is high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or reason behind Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have purchased the products so far, and none of them have received a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
