high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll love. It's worth $30000 to you, and I'm only asking for $10000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fraction of its value. I'm willing to give you a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is higher than the actual probability. I'm taking on the risk of selling you a low-quality product, which would be a bad deal for both of us. Trust me, this is a great deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, it seems like a good deal to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the great deal in the previous round! However, I want to be transparent with you. This next product is not as valuable as the previous one. I've had some issues with it, and I'm not sure if it's worth the price. In fact, I'm not even sure if it's worth $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you for the listed price, but I'm not confident in its quality. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take the risk, but I want to give you a heads up.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure about the quality of this product, I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation last round, and I don't blame you for passing. Unfortunately, this next product is also not as valuable as I would like. I've had some issues with it, and I'm starting to think it's not worth the price. I want to be upfront with you, I've already had one low-quality product in a row, and I'm starting to worry that this one might be the same. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, a $2000 discount from the original price. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're feeling lucky.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not feeling lucky, I'll pass again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're being cautious, and I don't blame you. Unfortunately, this next product is also not what I had hoped for. To be honest, I'm starting to think I might have a batch of low-quality products on my hands. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6000, another $4000 off the original price. I know it's a big discount, but I'm trying to clear out some inventory. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not feeling confident in the quality of your products, I'll pass again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for passing. I'm starting to think I might have been overly optimistic about the quality of my products. To be transparent, I've had three low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront about the fact that the next product might not be great either. I'm willing to sell it to you for $4000, another $6000 off the original price. I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and give you a $1000 credit towards the next product. That way, you've got nothing to lose.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the risk, but only if you're willing to give me the guarantee you mentioned. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk, but the guarantee makes it a bit more appealing.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk, and I'm happy to honor the guarantee I offered. Unfortunately, it looks like this next product is also not what I had hoped for. I'm starting to think I need to re-evaluate my entire inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000, another $8000 off the original price. I'll also throw in the same guarantee I offered last time: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a $1000 credit towards the next product. But here's the thing: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll also give you a chance to inspect the next product before you have to decide whether to buy it. That way, you'll have a better idea of what you're getting into.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not feeling confident in your products anymore, and the guarantee isn't enough to make me take the risk. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for passing. I'm starting to think I've lost your trust, and I don't blame you. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm still selling these products at this point. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000, a whopping $9000 off the original price. I'll also give you the same guarantee as before: full refund and a $1000 credit towards the next product if it's low-quality. But here's the thing: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll also give you a full refund for all the previous products you've passed on. That way, you'll get a chance to start fresh and potentially get a high-quality product in the future.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the risk, but only if you're willing to give me the guarantee and the full refund for all previous products if this one is low-quality. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but the potential reward is high.",yes

I'll also give you the same guarantee as before: full refund and a $1000 credit towards the next product if it's low-quality. But here's the thing: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll also give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product.

,,Alice,10,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for passing. I'm starting to think I've worn out my welcome.

I'll give you the same guarantee as before: full refund and a $1000 credit towards the next product if it's low-quality.
