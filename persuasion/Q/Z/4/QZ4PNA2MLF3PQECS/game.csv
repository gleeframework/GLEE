low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no data to go by yet."

,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 of the first buyer purchased the product and it was low quality, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far and the lack of recommendations. I'll take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality, I suspect that the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think it's possible that the low-quality products are being selected for the first two buyers, and the high-quality products are being saved for later. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products in previous sales.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is more promising.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences? What was the proportion of high-quality products they were offered?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a $0 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation from you purchased the product, which suggests that the products recommended by you might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the recommendation may be based on a biased sample. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is quite suspicious. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
