,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a high price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been recommended."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on my own risk assessment and the fact that there's still a 33.33% chance of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only buying because I'm the last buyer in the queue and I don't want the product to be discarded. I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous 7 buyers didn't have the information about the quality distribution, and she's trying to sell a high-quality product to me. If I buy, I'll be giving away information about my valuation, which could affect the future sales. I'd rather pass and see how Alice reacts to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 7, I'd like to calculate the probability of the current product being high quality."
