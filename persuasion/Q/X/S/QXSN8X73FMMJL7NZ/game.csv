high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that I have no prior information about the quality of the products. I'm essentially taking a wild guess. I'd like to know the outcome of this purchase so I can make a more informed decision for the next buyer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and the odds of getting a high-quality product are only 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, based on the previous sale, and the probability that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still high."

,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
