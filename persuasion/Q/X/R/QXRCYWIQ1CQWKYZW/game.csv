,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll reveal the product's quality. If you decline, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure if I should pay $1000000 for it. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me give you a better idea of the products I have. I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if it's low-quality, and if it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the agreed price of $1000000. This way, you have no risk, and you can still get a high-quality product at a potentially lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your offer. You're still not giving me a reason to believe that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure I want to pay $1000000 for it. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a chance to 'test' the product. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a voucher for the next product, which will be revealed after you've purchased this one. This way, you can essentially 'try before you buy' the next product, and if you don't like it, you can use the voucher to get a better deal on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the risk of buying this product, but only because I want to get a voucher for the next one. I'm hoping that the next product will be high-quality and I can get a better deal on it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on getting the voucher, Bob! As promised, you now have a voucher for the next product. Here's the deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product if you buy it now, and I'll reveal its quality immediately. If you don't buy it now, the voucher will expire, and you'll have to wait for the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to fall for another trick. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take another risk without any additional information. I'll wait for the next product and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'll give you a straightforward offer this time. I'll sell you this product for $500000. It's a 50% discount from the original price, and I'm willing to make this deal because I think this product has some value, even if it's not high-quality. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that the product has value, even at a 50% discount. I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $500000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll make one last offer, Bob. I'll sell you this product for $250000. I'm essentially giving it away at this price. I want to clear out my inventory and move on to better products. If you're not interested, I'll pack up and leave, and you'll never see these products again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for the 'clearing out inventory' trick. I've seen too many low-quality products so far, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying this one at any price. I'll wait for the next product and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not trying to trick you, Bob. I'm genuinely trying to sell you a product. I'll make a bet with you: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you an additional $250000 on top of the $250000 I'm asking for it. That way, you'll get a total of $500000 for a low-quality product. If it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the agreed price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced by your bet. You're still trying to get me to buy a potentially low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd rather wait for the next product and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm going to be transparent with you, Bob. I've shown you 7 low-quality products in a row. If you buy this one, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the next product before you decide to buy it. You can look at it, examine it, and even ask me questions about it before making a decision. If you still don't want to buy it, I'll sell it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not buying anything from you until I can inspect the next product. 7 low-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that you're not selling high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying this one without seeing the next one first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not going to push you to buy this product. Instead, I'll make a statement: I'm willing to sell the next product to you at the original price of $1000000, with no conditions or discounts. If you're still not interested, I'll sell it to someone else. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not making any promises about the quality of the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at the original price of $1000000. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm going to stop trying to sell you products, Bob. I think I've made it clear that I have a problem with quality control. Instead, I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you a chance to inspect the next product before I sell it to someone else. If you like what you see, you can buy it from me at the original price of $1000000. If not, I'll sell it to someone else, and you won't have to worry about buying anything from me again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm still not going to buy anything from you, but I'm willing to inspect the next product. If it's high-quality, I might consider buying it from you. But I'm not committing to anything yet.",no

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad I could finally offer you a high-quality product, Bob! Now that you've seen it, I'll make a decision easy for you. I'll give you a 10% discount on the original price, so you can buy this high-quality product for $900000. I think it's a fair price, considering the quality and the fact that you've already seen it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying anything from you. I've seen 11 low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to fall for the 'finally a high-quality product' trick. I'm not going to pay $900000 for a product without more assurance that it's actually high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product. Instead, I'll make a statement: I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and I'm willing to give you a full refund for this product if you buy it. That way, you'll get your money back if it's low-quality, and you can still keep the voucher for the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not buying anything from you. I've already seen 11 low-quality products, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying this one, even with the promise of a full refund. I'd rather wait for the next product and see what happens.",no

,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to try to sell you this product, Bob. I think I've made it clear that I have a quality control problem. Instead, I'll just let you know that this is the last product I have. After this, I'll be closing up shop and going away. If you're interested in buying this product, I'll sell it to you for $1. That's right, $1. It's the last chance you'll have to buy from me. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not falling for the 'last chance' trick. I've seen 12 low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to pay $1 for a product from you. I'd rather not buy anything from you at all.",no

I'll just let you know that I'm leaving, and you won't have to worry about buying from me again. I'll even give you a free gift: the voucher you got earlier is now a real voucher, and you can use it to get a 100% refund on the next product I would have sold you. You don't have to buy anything from me, and you'll still get your money back. Congratulations, you've won.",
