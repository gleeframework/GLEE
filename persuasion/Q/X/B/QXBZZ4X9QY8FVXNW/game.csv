high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a high-quality product available for $10000. It's a rare and exceptional item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. Would you like to purchase it?,
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to take the risk of buying without knowing the actual quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution last round. This product is actually a lower-end item, but it's still a great opportunity to get a deal on a product at a significantly lower price than the high-end ones. I'm willing to let it go for $8000, a $2000 discount from the usual price. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced that it's worth the risk. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation. I'll be transparent with you - this product is indeed a lower-end item, and I'm not expecting to get the full $10000 for it. I'm willing to let it go for $6000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it, but if not, I'll keep it in mind for future negotiations.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. I'd rather wait for a higher-quality product or a better price for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll be even more transparent with you. I'll let you know that this product is one of the lower-quality ones, and I'm expecting to get only about 50% of the usual price for it. I'm willing to let it go for $5000, which is a very low price for a product that's still functional. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it, but if not, I'll keep it in mind for future negotiations.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal on a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll let you buy this product for $4000, and I'll throw in a guarantee that if you're not satisfied with it, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund. This is a one-time offer, and I'm essentially giving it away at this price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that it's a low-quality product, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in any of the lower-end products. I'll make you a deal that's a compromise between the price and the quality. I'll let you buy this product for $4000, but I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a good deal on this product and a chance to save even more on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take my chances with the next offer.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've got a high-quality product for you! Given that you've been waiting for one, I'm willing to make a deal. I'll give you a 15% discount on the usual price of $10000. That brings the price down to $8500. I'm confident that this product is worth every penny, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price. I'm willing to take the risk now that I have a chance at a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Now, I've got another high-quality product for you. Since you've already shown you're willing to pay a premium for a high-quality item, I'll give you an even better deal. I'll sell this one to you for $9000, which is a $1000 discount from the usual price. This product is a real gem, and I think you'll love it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price. I'm confident that it's worth more than $9000 to me, so I'm happy to pay the premium.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! Now, I've got another high-quality product for you. I'll give you an even better deal than before - I'll sell this one to you for $9500, which is still a discount from the usual price. However, I'll also throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, regardless of its quality. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find this product is worth every penny. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price and the bonus discount on the next product. I'm confident that it's worth more than $9500 to me, and the bonus discount is a nice added value.",yes

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I have to admit that this next product is a lower-end item. I'll be upfront with you - it's not as good as the high-quality products you've been buying. But I'm willing to let it go for a very low price: $3500. I'm essentially giving it away at this price, and I think you can still get some value out of it. Plus, remember the 10% discount you earned on the last purchase? You can use it on this product, so you'll get it for $3150. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a lower-end product, even at a very low price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal on a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. I've got a great one for you now. Since you've been patient and only bought high-quality products from me so far, I'll give you an exclusive offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the full $10000, but I'll also throw in a second, identical high-quality product absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll love it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"That's an incredible offer! I'll take the two high-quality products for $10000. I'm confident that the total value of the two products will be at least $25000, so I'm getting a great deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you took advantage of the incredible offer! Now, I've got a product that's not as good as the high-quality ones, but it's still a decent item. I'll be honest with you - it's not worth the full $10000, but I'll let it go for $5000. However, I'll also throw in a unique feature: I'll give you a personalized guarantee that I'll replace it with a high-quality product of your choice within the next 5 rounds, if you buy this one. That way, you'll get a chance to experience a high-quality product without having to wait for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a lower-end product. The personalized guarantee is tempting, but I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that I know I'll love, rather than taking a chance on a lower-end product with a guarantee.",no

,,Alice,13,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. However, I want to remind you that you've already taken advantage of the incredible offer of two high-quality products for $10000, which is a great value. Considering that, I'm willing to let this lower-end product go for an even lower price: $2500. This is a very low price for a product that still has some value. I'll also throw in a small gift, a $100 gift card to a popular online store, just for trying to make a deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a lower-end product. The gift card is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to change my mind.",no

,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying any more products from me. I'll be honest with you, this is my last chance to make a deal. I'll let this product go for a ridiculously low price: $1000. It's essentially a giveaway, and I'm not even going to throw in a gift card this time. I just want to clear out my inventory and move on. If you're not interested, I'll just have to take a loss on this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd rather not take the risk of buying something that's not valuable to me.",no

I just want to get rid of it and move on. It's a low-quality product, but it's still something that might have some value to someone. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it myself. What do you say?",
