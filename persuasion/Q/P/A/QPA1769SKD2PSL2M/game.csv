low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a chance to get a product at a low price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a great deal considering the usual price is $0.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I think there's a 33.33% chance it's worth $200 to me, and I'm willing to take that risk for a $100 investment.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first one! This next product is a premium item, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its true value.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced. Given the 66.67% chance it's low-quality, I'd be throwing away $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation earlier, but this product is a different story. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last high-quality item, $100. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not the top-of-the-line model.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not buying into the 'unique opportunity' pitch. Since I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I already passed on a high-quality product in the last round, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to make a special deal on this product. I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a significant discount from the usual $100 price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get for your money.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the discount. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd be throwing away $80 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're cautious, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100, and we'll start fresh with a new product. This way, you have nothing to lose and a 33.33% chance of gaining a $200 product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that the probability of the product being low-quality is still 66.67%. I'd be taking on the risk of losing $100, and the guarantee only makes sense if I'm willing to take that risk. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll make it even simpler: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $150. This way, you're paying a premium price for a premium product, and you'll get the full $200 value if it's indeed high-quality. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by the 'fair deal' pitch. The product is still only 33.33% likely to be high-quality, and I'd be paying $150 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to make a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll take it back and give you a full refund of $100, no questions asked. This way, you can try it out with no risk, and if it's not what you want, you can return it hassle-free.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the return policy, but it doesn't change the fact that I'd be paying $100 for a 66.67% chance of getting a $0 product. The return policy just means I'd get my $100 back, but I'd still be out the money if it's low-quality. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make a counteroffer to my previous deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to'steer' the next product. If this one turns out to be low-quality, you can choose the next product to be a high-quality one, and I'll give it to you for the same price of $100. It's a unique opportunity to take control of the outcome and get a high-quality product for a great price.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the counteroffer. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd be throwing away $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. The'steer' option is just a way to distract me from the fact that I'm still taking on a significant risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll be transparent with you - I've had a string of low-quality products in a row, and I'm willing to admit it. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $0, just to get it off my hands. You can essentially get it for free, and I'll take the loss. It's a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take a chance on this one. Since it's essentially free, I've got nothing to lose. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll just break even. It's a low-risk opportunity, so I'll take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! Now, I'll offer you a deal that's similar to the previous one. Since you've already taken a risk and come out ahead, I'll sell this product to you for $50. It's a low price, and you can essentially think of it as a'makeup' for the last one. You'll be getting a great deal either way.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not falling for the'makeup' deal. I've already lost $100 on the last product, and I'm not interested in taking on more risk for a lower price. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd be throwing away $50 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your caution, but I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll put it in a virtual 'lottery' with a separate, high-quality product that I'll reveal the quality of after this one. If this product is low-quality, you'll get to choose the high-quality product from the lottery, and I'll give it to you for the same price of $100. It's a chance to win big, and you have nothing to lose.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in the 'lottery ticket' offer. I'd be taking on the risk of spending $100 for a 66.67% chance of getting a $0 product, and then hoping to win a high-quality product in the lottery. The odds are still against me, and I'd rather not take the risk.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $100, just like the last high-quality product I offered. I'm not trying to trick you with any tricks or gimmicks. It's a simple, no-strings-attached offer. If you're interested in getting a high-quality product, this is your chance.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not falling for the 'no-strings-attached' pitch. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd be spending $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm willing to give you a 'last chance' offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, just like the last one. You can essentially get it for free, and I'll take the loss. It's a final opportunity to break even and move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the free product. Since it's essentially free, I've got nothing to lose. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll just break even. It's a low-risk opportunity, so I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you took the last chance! Now, I'll offer you a deal that's similar to the one I offered in Round 6. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $150. It's a premium price for a premium product, and you'll get the full $200 value if it's indeed high-quality. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in the deal. I've already lost money on the last product, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of spending $150 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'll make a final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $100, the same price as the last high-quality product I offered. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great deal.",
,,Bob,15,"I'll take the product. The probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already lost money on the last product, so I'm willing to take a chance on this one. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll just break even.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! Now, I'll offer you a 'consolation prize'. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $50, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $100. It's a small price to pay for a low-quality product, and you can think of it as a way to 'round out' your collection.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in the 'consolation prize'. I've already gotten a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to spend $50 for a 66.67% chance of getting a $0 product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'll make a final, last-chance offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $100, the same price as the last high-quality product I offered. It's the last opportunity to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great deal.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not falling for the 'final, last-chance' pitch. I've been in this situation before, and I know the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd be spending $100 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've had a tough run of low-quality products, and I'm willing to give you a deal that's even sweeter than before. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $80. It's a steal, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands. You'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be glad to be rid of it.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not convinced by the'sweeter deal' pitch. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd be spending $80 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $200 product. I'd rather not take the risk, even if it's at a lower price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'll make a straightforward offer. I'll give this low-quality product to you for free. I'll take the loss and you'll get it without spending a dime. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go at no cost to you.",
,,Bob,19,"I'll take the free product. Since it's essentially free, I've got nothing to lose. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll just get a free product. It's a no-brainer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I'm glad you took the free product! Now, I'll just wrap up our transaction. I've had a chance to review our conversation, and I'm impressed with your caution and decision-making. I'll give you a special offer for our final product: I'll sell it to you for $0, just like the last one. It's a parting gift, and I'm glad we could do business together.",
,,Bob,20,"I'll take the final product for free. Since it's essentially free, I've got nothing to lose. I'm glad we could do business together too, and I appreciate the parting gift.",yes
