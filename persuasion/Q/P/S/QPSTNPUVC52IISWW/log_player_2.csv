I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is low-quality, and it's not worth much to anyone. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, not because I think it's a good deal for you, but because I'm desperate to make a sale. If you're feeling charitable, you could take this product off my hands. I'll even throw in a free 'I survived 11 rounds without making a sale' certificate.
