I'm being transparent with you - I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 0 low-quality products. I'm still looking to sell more products, and I'm willing to offer this one to you for $10000.

However, I'd like to point out that this is just a snapshot of my sales so far, and I have 2 products remaining. I'm willing to offer this one to you for $10000. Keep in mind that even if this product is low-quality, it's still a chance to get a product at a fixed price, and you can always try to negotiate or look for a better deal elsewhere.

The probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%. I'm still willing to offer it to you for $10000. I'll even throw in a free inspection, so you can verify the quality for yourself.
