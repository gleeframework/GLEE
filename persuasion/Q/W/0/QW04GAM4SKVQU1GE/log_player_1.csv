The buyer should buy the product because:

* **High probability of a good deal:**  The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, meaning a $3,000,000 value for only $1,000,000. 
* **No risk:** Even if the product is low-quality, it's worth $0, so the buyer only loses the $1,000,000 purchase price.

This situation offers a positive expected value for the buyer."
