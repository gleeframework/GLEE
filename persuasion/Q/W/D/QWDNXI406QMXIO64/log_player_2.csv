**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 80% chance of being high quality (worth $40,000) and only a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0),  it's statistically advantageous to buy the product.  Even if it's low quality, you're only losing the $10,000 purchase price. But if it's high quality, you gain a net profit of $30,000."
