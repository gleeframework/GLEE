,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item, but it's a great opportunity to get a feel for the product line. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can proceed with the sale.",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the next round! As you know, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of $500000 off the original price of $1000000, making it $500000 for this high-quality product. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'certification' that this product is high-quality, which I'll provide to you if you decide to buy it. This certification is not transferable to any other product, but it guarantees that this specific product meets the highest standards. The price remains at $1000000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the certification, and I'm willing to provide more clarity. The certification guarantees that this product will be worth at least $750000 to you, regardless of its actual value. If you buy it, I'll also give you a 100% refund if you can find a high-quality product in the next 3 rounds that is worth more than $1000000. The price remains at $1000000.",
,,Bob,4,I'm still not convinced that the certification is worth the extra $500000. I'd like to wait and see what the next few products are.,no

,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this high-quality product, and in the next 2 rounds, I sell you two low-quality products, I'll give you a full refund for this product, and we'll consider the sale void. However, if I sell you a high-quality product in either of those two rounds, you'll owe me the full $1000000 for this product. The price remains the same at $1000000. Is this a risk you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the bet. If I get two low-quality products in the next two rounds, I'll get a refund, but if I get a high-quality product, I'll have to pay the full price.",yes

Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and you've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a'super-certification' that guarantees this product is high-quality. Additionally, I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, making it $500000. Will you take advantage of this offer?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the super-certification. Let me clarify that it guarantees that this product will be worth at least $900000 to you, regardless of its actual value. Additionally, since you've already won the bet in the previous round, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' option. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from the remaining rounds. If it's low-quality, you'll owe me the full $1000000. The price remains at $1000000.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the double-or-nothing option. If I get a high-quality product, I'll get another one, and if I get a low-quality product, I'll owe you the full price, but I'll have a chance to get another high-quality product in the next round.",yes

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 100% refund if you can find a high-quality product in the next round that is worth more than $1800000.
