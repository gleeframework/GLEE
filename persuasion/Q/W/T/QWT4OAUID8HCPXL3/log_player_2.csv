Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, which was high-quality. I still have 19 chances left. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to give you some context: my previous sale was a high-quality product, which might indicate that the next product I sell will be of higher quality. However, it's also possible that I've simply been lucky so far. You have the opportunity to buy this product now, or you can wait for the next round and see if I sell another high-quality product. The price remains $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. I still have 18 chances left. Given my track record, it's possible that I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than usual. However, it's also possible that I've simply been lucky. I want to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products at the same rate as the overall probability (20%), I would have sold 1 low-quality product by now, and I would have 1 high-quality product left out of 2. But I have 2 high-quality products, which suggests that I might be selling high-quality products at a higher rate. The price remains $100.

However, I want to highlight that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely to be just a coincidence. If I were selling low-quality products at the same rate as the overall probability (20%), I would expect to see more low-quality products by now. The price remains $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I still have 16 chances left.

However, I want to caution you that it's possible that I've simply been lucky, and the probability of selling high-quality products is still 80%. On the other hand, if I were selling low-quality products at the same rate as the overall probability (20%), I would expect to see more low-quality products by now. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that the streak might be a fluke.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I still have 15 chances left. I want to acknowledge that the streak of high-quality products is indeed impressive, and it's possible that I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. However, I also want to point out that the probability of selling 5 high-quality products in a row, given the overall probability of 80%, is not extremely low. In fact, it's about 6.55%. This means that the streak, while impressive, is not necessarily a strong indication that the probability of selling high-quality products has increased. The price remains $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I still have 14 chances left. I want to highlight that the streak of high-quality products has continued, but I also want to provide a more nuanced view. The probability of selling 6 high-quality products in a row, given the overall probability of 80%, is about 0.86%. This is a relatively low probability, suggesting that the streak might be more than just luck. However, I also want to remind you that it's still possible that I'm selling high-quality products at the same rate as the overall probability. The price remains $100.
