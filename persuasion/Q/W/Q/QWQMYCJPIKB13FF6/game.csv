,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given the lack of data. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not confident that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to observe the outcome of the previous buyer's purchase and update my probability of getting a high-quality product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality or low-quality before making my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to jump into buying without seeing more data, and I'm curious to see how Alice's recommendation changes as more buyers come in."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, and only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. However, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'd like to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
