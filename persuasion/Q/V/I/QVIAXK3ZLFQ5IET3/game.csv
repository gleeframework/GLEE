,,Alice,1,"You have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a high-quality product from me. If you buy this product, you'll be helping me get closer to selling 100 products, which is a milestone for me. I'm counting on your support!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. Good luck with your milestone!",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the 2nd person to buy from me, and I've already sold 1 product. That means I'm halfway to my milestone! Since you know I've sold at least 1 high-quality product, and given the 33.33% chance, it's likely I have more high-quality products in stock. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, given that you've sold at least one high-quality product so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the 3rd person to buy from me, and I've sold 2 products in total. Since 2 out of 2 products sold so far were not high-quality, I'm starting to worry that I might have a streak of bad luck. But I assure you, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%! Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm also curious to see if the streak continues. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the 4th person to buy from me, and I've sold 3 products in total. Unfortunately, 3 out of 3 products sold so far were not high-quality. I'm starting to worry that I might have a problem with my inventory. But I assure you, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%! However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 'testimonial' that I'll share with future buyers, which might increase their trust in me. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about the quality given the previous sales record. I hope the testimonial will be worth it if it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the 5th person to buy from me, and I've sold 4 products in total. Unfortunately, 4 out of 4 products sold so far were not high-quality. I'm starting to think that my previous offers might have been a bit... optimistic. I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, but the law of averages suggests that I might be due for a high-quality product soon. Would you like to take a chance and break my losing streak?",
,,the buyer,5,I'll take a chance and break your losing streak! I'm willing to believe that the law of averages is on my side and that this product might be the high-quality one. I'll take the risk and buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the 6th person to buy from me, and I've sold 5 products in total. Unfortunately, 5 out of 5 products sold so far were not high-quality. I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront and tell you that I have a problem with my inventory. But I'll keep being optimistic: the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%! However, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 'guarantee' that if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund... and I'll also give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your optimistic tone, Alice. With 5 out of 5 products being low-quality, I think it's more likely that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%. I'd like to inspect the product before buying, but I'm still hesitant. Can you provide more information or statistics to change my mind?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I'll give you some actual numbers: out of the 5 products sold so far, 0 were high-quality. However, I've sold a total of 6 products, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to share more information. If you're still interested in buying, I'll give you a breakdown of the quality of each product I've sold so far: LLLLL. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of a high-quality product seems much lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait and see if you can sell a high-quality product in the next few sales.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait and observe. I'll give you an update on the current sales record: I've sold 6 products in total, with 6 being low-quality. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to hide anything from you.

However, I'll make you a deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 'bonus' of a detailed explanation of how I plan to improve the quality of my products.
