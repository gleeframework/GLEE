For this one-time offer, I'll throw in some exclusive consulting services worth $50000 absolutely free. That's a $1000000 product for just $950000. What do you say? Is it worth taking a chance?",

,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not sure what I'd gain from just looking at the product without being able to use it. I'd like to wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality and my own evaluation, not just a visual inspection.",no

If you buy this product, I'll throw in a second product of equal value absolutely free. That's two products for the price of one! You'll be getting a great deal, and you'll have the chance to evaluate both products and decide which one is right for you. What do you say, Bob? Are you willing to take a chance on this offer?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that getting a second product for free makes up for the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality and my own evaluation.",no
