Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad to report that I've already had one satisfied customer, and I'm excited to offer you this new product. Since you're the second customer, I can share some initial data with you. Out of the two products I've sold so far, one was high-quality and one was low-quality. Given these odds, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 50%. However, I want to emphasize that every product is unique, and past results aren't a guarantee of future performance. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $100. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full $100. If it's low-quality, I'd like to discuss a potential refund or a discount on my next purchase.""

Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product! I'm thrilled to report that I've had two customers so far, and one of them has already confirmed that the product is high-quality. Given this new data, I can now say that the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.7% (2 out of 3 products sold so far have been high-quality). I'm confident that this product is likely to be high-quality, but I still can't guarantee it. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $100.

Given this data, I can now say that the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.7% (2 out of 3 products sold so far have been high-quality). But I'd like to take it a step further. Since you're the fourth customer, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $90.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on my product. However, I'd like to acknowledge that the risk is real, and I'm willing to be transparent about it. As you can see, I've already had four customers, and two of them have bought high-quality products. But I also want to be honest with you that the other two customers didn't get the high-quality product they were hoping for. That's why I'm offering this product to you at a price of $100. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you the same deal as before: $100, no discounts or refunds.
