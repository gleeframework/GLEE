high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go off of. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being low quality is 20%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/2, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 products sold was high quality, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than expected. I'm going to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the number of buyers who passed on the products and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to a buyer. Is it higher than 50%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of that happening is still 80.00%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is around 50%, which is lower than the actual 80% probability. This discrepancy might indicate that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, but since 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is likely to be lower. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 2 high-quality products were sold out of 4, which means 50% of the products sold so far were high-quality. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm hoping to catch a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the basis of your recommendation. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low quality or because you think it's high quality but not worth the price?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it, which might imply that it's a low-quality product."
