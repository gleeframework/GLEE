high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not buying. I'd like to see some data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no information to base my decision on."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you know the quality, but I don't, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I get the updated statistics after this purchase?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I think there's a high chance this product is low-quality and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, but based on your previous recommendations, I'm skeptical. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given that you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher probability of low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it. If all 3 previous buyers were offered low-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm not going to fall into the trap of buying a low-quality product just because of Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%. Given the lack of evidence, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and observe the next recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Are you basing it on the statistics, or do you have some other information?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think there's a good chance the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds are 50/50, and I might get a good deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet makes me cautious. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
