,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, with a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'd rather not take the risk.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

With 2 out of the 7 products being high-quality, the probability would now be different from the initial 33.33%. However, since today's product is low-quality, there's still a 33.33% chance it could be high-quality. We're committed to providing transparency and helping you make informed decisions. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take the product.
