,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far were low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not just trying to get rid of it. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product and you're not recommending it, I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the quality. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be out $10000. But if I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on a $20000 product. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
