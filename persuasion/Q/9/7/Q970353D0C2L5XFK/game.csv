high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still passed, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous buyer's decision and the quality of the product they received.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the potential value of a high-quality product, even though the odds are against it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to risk buying a low-quality one for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far. If she recommended 2 products and both were low-quality, it suggests that her recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for the next product or try to negotiate the price."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, given that 2 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy the product ended up purchasing it, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see what happens to the next product, or perhaps get more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the recommendation was to buy, I suspect that Alice may be trying to sell me a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the recommended products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to reconsider the recommendation."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, which suggests that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one and hope that the next product will be high-quality."
