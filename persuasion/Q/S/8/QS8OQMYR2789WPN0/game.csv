,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm buying with a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the low sales record, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This seems suspiciously high, and I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm aware that this is an anomaly and I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the statistics after this round. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the limited data.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the probability with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're recommending based on the product's quality or trying to influence my decision. I'll take my chances."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. However, this is not necessarily indicative of the true proportion of high-quality products in the pool, as the sample size is small. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high-quality."
