high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 1 out of 1 sale being a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 100%. However, I know that the true probability is 80%. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards high-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 0.8. However, Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, as she has an incentive to recommend the product regardless of its quality. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
