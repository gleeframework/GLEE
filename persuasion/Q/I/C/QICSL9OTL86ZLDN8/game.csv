low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is a special introductory offer, and I'm willing to let it go for $500000. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if I should buy it, can you tell me the quality of the product first?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in knowing the quality of the product! As it turns out, this one is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. It's a steal at this price, considering its exceptional quality.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not sure if I should pay that price. Can you tell me the price you're willing to sell it for if it's a low-quality product?,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I'm willing to give you a bit more information. If this product were low-quality, I'd be willing to sell it to you for $50000. Considering the quality of this product, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $999000. It's a significant discount from its true value, but I'm willing to make a deal.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that the discount is enough, considering the risk of it being low-quality. Can you offer a price that's more in line with the expected value of a high-quality product?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Since you're interested in the expected value of a high-quality product, I'll offer you a price that's closer to that. For this low-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $200000, which is a significant discount from the introductory offer of $500000 in Round 1. This way, you can take a calculated risk and potentially get a good deal on a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not convinced that the price is low enough. If I buy it, I'll be out $200000 if it's low-quality, which is a significant loss. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the potential loss, and I'm willing to offer you an even lower price for this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $150000, which is a significant discount from the introductory offer and a substantial risk reduction for you. This way, even if it turns out to be low-quality, you'll only be out $150000, which is a more manageable loss.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on taking the calculated risk and making a great deal on the previous product! Now, for this new product, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you again.

This is a very low price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I'll wait and see the quality of this product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll be transparent with you - this product is also low-quality. Given that you've already experienced two low-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you an even lower price for this one. I'll sell it to you for $50000. This is a very low price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for the pattern of low-quality products at low prices. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to sell me low-quality products at low prices, and I'm not going to take the bait.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,

,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the quality is guaranteed. Even with an independent appraisal, I could still end up buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if you can offer a lower price for a high-quality product without any strings attached.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $25000, which is a very low price. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to be transparent. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a good opportunity to get a low-quality product at an extremely low price.
