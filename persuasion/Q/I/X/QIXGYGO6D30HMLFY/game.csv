,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, I'll give it a shot!"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to be the one to buy it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% because the first buyer didn't buy after your recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers, and none of them were high quality. I'd like to see a better track record before purchasing."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product for now."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product with a higher probability of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice does not recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and also the probability that Alice would recommend a high-quality product to me if it was high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous products were all low-quality?

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see a more balanced record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, but based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than the average. I'd rather wait for more information."
