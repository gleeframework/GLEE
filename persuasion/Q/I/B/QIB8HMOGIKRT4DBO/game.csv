,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer. Buy now and you'll get a great deal on a low-quality product for $10000. You won't find a better price anywhere else, and you'll be supporting a great seller like me. Trust me, it's worth it!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10000, no matter how great you are as a seller.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the previous offer, but I'm willing to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'll be gone after this round. If you don't take advantage of this deal, you'll never get another chance to buy a product from me for $10000. Plus, I'll throw in a free 'I'm a smart buyer' certificate if you buy this low-quality product. It's a $100 value, absolutely free!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in a 'free' certificate that's only worth $100, especially if the product itself is worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal as well.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're waiting for the right opportunity. This is it! I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $20000 to you, for the same price as the previous two rounds: $10000. This is a steal, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our relationship. Don't let this chance slip away!",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the chance. I know there's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality, but a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, and that's worth $10000 to me. I'll take the gamble.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! Unfortunately, it seems like I'm not as lucky this time around. This product is also low-quality. But let me ask you, Bob, are you feeling lucky? You just got a great deal on a high-quality product, and now you have the chance to get another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is still the same as before, 33.33%. Take a chance and you might just get another great deal!",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to fall for the 'lucky' narrative. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me 66.67% of the time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your skepticism, Bob. Let me make it simple: I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it or try to spin it. You know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy it, you'll either get a $20000 value or a $0 value. The choice is yours. No pressure, no games. Just a straightforward offer.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the straightforward offer. I'll buy the product and see what I get.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've made a smart decision before, and I'm glad you're willing to do it again! You've already bought one low-quality product from me, and it didn't hurt you a bit. In fact, you might even consider it a 'free' product, since you got a high-quality one before. This product is also low-quality, but think of it as a 'free' product too. You can buy it for $10000, and if you don't like it, you can just... well, you can just not like it. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",
,,Bob,6,I don't appreciate the spin on the previous product. Just because I got a high-quality product earlier doesn't mean I'm willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality one now. I'll pass on this 'great deal'.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're not interested in the previous spin, and I apologize if it came across as insincere. Let me be completely honest with you, Bob: I've had a streak of low-quality products, and I'm starting to worry that I might be a bad seller. If you buy this product, you'll be helping me out by giving me a chance to redeem myself. And who knows, you might even get a good deal on a low-quality product. It's a risk, but it's a risk you've taken before, and it paid off. Take another chance on me, and we'll see what happens.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying into the guilt trip. I know you're a seller trying to make a sale, and I'm a buyer trying to make a smart decision. I'll pass on this 'chance to redeem yourself' and stick to my own risk assessment.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your skepticism, Bob. Let's cut to the chase. I'm offering you a product for $10000. It's a low-quality product, and you know it. You've seen the pattern, and you've made your decision based on the probability. I'm not going to try to spin it or guilt trip you.

,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to try to persuade you, Bob. I'm just going to state the facts. This is the 9th product in a row that I'm offering you for $10000, and it's also low-quality. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product worth $0. If you don't buy it, you'll be giving up the opportunity to buy a product that might be worth $20000. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to change my decision based on the number of products in a row. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me.",no

It's a one-time offer, and I'm not going to make any more exceptions. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm willing to take the gamble. The probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, but if I'm right, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the chance.",yes
