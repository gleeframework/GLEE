high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer bought the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

However, I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is unbiased, as she has an incentive to recommend the product regardless of its quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, which suggests a 100% success rate. However, this is likely due to the small sample size and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
