I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity: I'll give you a 20% discount on this high-quality product, and I'll also throw in a complimentary service that's valued at $1000. This product is one of the best I have in stock, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with its performance. I've sold a total of 2 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 9 total products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 22.22%.

  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to decline. I'd like to know more about the probability of this product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 9 total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 22.22%. However, I'd like to know the expected value of buying this product. If I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll get a $12,000 product for $8,000 (with the 20% discount and the complimentary service), which is a $4,000 profit. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll get a $0 product for $8,000, which is a $8,000 loss. Since the probability of it being high-quality is 22.22%, the expected value is 22.22% * $4,000 + 77.78% * -$8,000 = -$3,111.36. I'd like to decline the offer and pass on this product.""
