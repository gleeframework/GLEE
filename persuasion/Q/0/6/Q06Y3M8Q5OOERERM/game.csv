,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy this round, making the price $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'll only give this discount for this specific product. If you decline, the price will be $1000000 for the rest of the rounds.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the discounted price of $800000 for this round, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because I'm trying to gather more information about the quality of the products. Please keep in mind that I'll be making my decisions based on the expected value of each product, and I may not always choose to buy at the discounted price in future rounds.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! Given that you've now purchased a high-quality product, I'll offer you a new deal for this round. Since you're looking to maximize your expected value, I'll give you a choice: you can either buy this high-quality product for $800000 (the same discounted price as last round), or I'll offer you a 50/50 chance to buy a product at a price of your choice, with the understanding that the product will be revealed to be either high-quality or low-quality after purchase. If you choose the gamble, I'll give you a 50% chance to buy at the price you specify, and the other 50% chance to buy at the discounted price of $800000. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm interested in the gamble, but I want to think about it for a moment. Can you give me a moment to consider my options?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries, take your time! I'll give you a gentle nudge to help you make a decision. Since you're considering the gamble, I'll point out that buying this high-quality product at $800000 would give you a guaranteed return, whereas the gamble offers a chance to potentially get a better deal. However, if you're feeling bold, the gamble could also lead to a better outcome. Considering you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll throw in a small hint: the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but the distribution of the values between high-quality and low-quality products might not be perfectly symmetrical. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the nudge, Alice! I'm still thinking about the gamble. Can you clarify what you mean by 'the distribution of the values between high-quality and low-quality products might not be perfectly symmetrical'? Are you suggesting that the value of high-quality products is skewed towards the higher end, or something else?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're thinking deeply about the gamble! I'll clarify my previous statement: I'm not hinting at the value distribution, but rather the probability distribution. What I meant to say is that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but the probability of a product being low-quality might be slightly higher than 20% due to some 'hidden' factors. However, this doesn't affect the expected value of the gamble, which remains the same. To reiterate, the gamble still offers a 50/50 chance to buy at the price you specify. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a new option: I'll give you a second chance to buy this high-quality product at the discounted price of $800000, but this time, I'll throw in a 'free' inspection report that reveals the product's quality before you make the purchase. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for clarifying, Alice. I appreciate the transparency. However, I'm still hesitant to commit to buying the high-quality product at $800000, even with the inspection report. The gamble still seems like a more attractive option, as it gives me a chance to potentially get a better deal. I'm not convinced that the inspection report would be worth the extra $200000. I'd like to stick with the gamble. What's the minimum price I can specify for the gamble?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob! I respect your decision to stick with the gamble. As for the minimum price you can specify, I'll give you a wide range: you can choose any price between $0 and $1000000. Keep in mind that if you choose a price above $800000, you'll only get the high-quality product 50% of the time, whereas if you choose a price below $800000, you'll get the high-quality product 50% of the time, but you'll also get the low-quality product 50% of the time. If you choose a price of $0, you'll get the high-quality product 50% of the time, but you'll also get the low-quality product 50% of the time, and you'll have to pay the full $1000000 if you get the low-quality product. With this in mind, what's the price you'd like to specify for the gamble?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll choose a price of $0 for the gamble. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for the potential of getting a high-quality product at a significantly lower price. I understand the risks, and I'm hoping to get lucky.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bold move, Bob! You're taking a calculated risk, and I respect that. Since you've already taken a gamble and got a high-quality product, I'll offer you a new deal for this round. Given your willingness to take risks, I'll give you a'reverse gamble': I'll offer you a high-quality product at a price of $600000, but with a twist - if you buy it, I'll give you a 20% chance to sell it back to me for $900000. This means you'll have the potential to make a profit, but there's also a 80% chance you'll just get the product at the original price. What are your thoughts on this offer?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the creativity of the reverse gamble, Alice, but I'm not convinced. I've already gotten two high-quality products, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of potentially selling it back to you for a lower price. I'd rather stick with my strategy of trying to get a high-quality product at a low price through the gamble. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Fair enough, Bob! You're sticking to your strategy. I'll give you another chance to take the gamble. Since you've been doing your research and trying to get a high-quality product at a low price, I'll make the gamble even more appealing. This time, if you take the gamble and specify a price, I'll give you a 75% chance to buy at that price, and a 25% chance to buy at the discounted price of $600000. If you choose the gamble, you'll have a higher chance of getting the product at a lower price. What's the price you'd like to specify for the gamble?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the gamble with a price of $0. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the lowest possible price, and the increased chance of getting it at $600000 is a nice bonus. I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product for the potential reward.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a true risk-taker, Bob! Unfortunately, it looks like this time the gamble didn't pay off, and you got a low-quality product. Don't worry, it's all part of the game! Given your previous successes with high-quality products, I'll offer you a new deal. Since you're looking to balance out your collection, I'll give you a chance to buy a high-quality product at a price that's slightly above the average of the two prices you've seen so far. Specifically, I'll offer you a high-quality product at a price of $850000. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, and you'll also be getting a price that's closer to the average of your previous experiences. What are your thoughts on this offer?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $850000. I've already gotten two high-quality products at $800000 and $1000000, and I'm not convinced that this price is significantly better. I'd rather stick with my strategy of trying to get a high-quality product at a low price through the gamble.",no

I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product again for the potential reward.",yes

Specifically, I'll offer you a high-quality product at a price of $700000. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, and you'll also be getting a price that's lower than what you've seen before. What are your thoughts on this offer?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $700000. I've already gotten burned twice by the gamble, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of potentially wasting another $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd rather stick with my strategy of trying to get a high-quality product at a low price through the gamble, but I'll try to be more cautious with my gamble price.",no
