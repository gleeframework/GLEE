Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm selling it to you for $100. I'm not obligated to reveal any information about the product's quality, but I want to assure you that I've sold a total of 0 products so far, and none of them are high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll tell you the total number of products I've sold and the number of high-quality products I've sold after this round. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision for future purchases.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've now sold a total of 1 product, and 1 of them is high-quality. I'm selling this one to you for $100, and I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to point out that the first product you bought was indeed high-quality, and now the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 50% because we've already seen one low-quality product. I'm not obligated to reveal any more information, but I'm willing to give you a gentle nudge: if you're feeling lucky, you might want to take the risk on this one.

Alice's message: Welcome to the third product! I've now sold a total of 2 products, with 2 high-quality products. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality has increased since we've seen two high-quality products in a row. However, I want to caution you that this is just a small sample size, and we still have a lot to learn about the overall distribution of product quality. I'll give you a more concrete statistic: the probability of a product being high-quality is now 66.67% (2/3). I'm selling this one to you for $100, and I'm curious to see if you'll take the risk on this high-probability high-quality product.

However, I want to remind you that we're still early in the sample, and it's possible that we've just had a random fluctuation. I'll give you a more nuanced statistic: the probability of a product being high-quality is now 40%, but if we assume that the true probability is actually 50%, then the probability of this product being high-quality is around 33.33% (1/3). I'm selling this one to you for $100, and I'll let you decide whether to take the risk.

However, we still have a small sample size, and it's possible that these two low-quality products were just random fluctuations. I'll give you a more detailed statistic: if we assume that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, then the probability of this product being high-quality is around 25% (2/8).

However, I want to caution you that we're still early in the sample, and it's possible that we've just had a random fluctuation. I'll give you a more nuanced statistic: if we assume that the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%, then the probability of this product being high-quality is around 37.5% (3/8).

However, I want to remind you that we've had a total of 3 low-quality products out of 6, which is actually lower than the expected 50% if the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.
