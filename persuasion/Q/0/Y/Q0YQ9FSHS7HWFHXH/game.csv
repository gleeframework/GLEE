,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll be getting an excellent deal. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you today. If you don't buy it, I'll be selling it to someone else at a higher price.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take your word for it and buy the product, since the potential gain of $1000000 is significant and the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first purchase! As it turns out, I have another high-quality product available. However, I want to give you a chance to reconsider the price. Given the significant profit you made on the first product, I'm willing to offer this one to you for $800000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to renegotiate the price. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the lower price point, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $800000.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! Given the fact that you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a price that's even more competitive. This product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $600000. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this price again. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.",
,,Bob,3,"You're offering an even lower price point, which is enticing. However, I notice that the actual purchase price in the previous rounds was $1000000, not the offered discounted price. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I expect the actual price to be $1000000 again.",yes

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not as certain about its quality as I was with the previous ones. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier purchase.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty about the uncertainty of the product's quality. However, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the potential gain is significant. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1000000, as the expected value is still in my favor.",yes
