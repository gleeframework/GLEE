Given the fact that you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a price that's even more competitive. This product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $600,000. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this price again. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.""
