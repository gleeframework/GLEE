,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my initial uninformed decision, as there's no prior data to influence my choice. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware of the 66.67% chance of it being low quality."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if you have any information about the first buyer's decision and the product they received.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far might have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience or because of the statistics?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far and the recommendation is to buy suggests that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's limited information. I'd like to observe the next product and see if the recommendation changes based on the updated statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not convinced by your recommendation and would rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."

,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the probability that the product is low-quality is 66.67%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially since I know it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to be the first to buy a product after seeing the previous statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather take a chance and pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal or more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers received low-quality products and didn't buy, I suspect the product may be low-quality and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
