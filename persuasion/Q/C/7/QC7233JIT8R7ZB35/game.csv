,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not going to take the risk. I think the previous buyer's decision is a good indication that the product is likely low quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%. However, the fact that the previous buyer was recommended to buy and didn't suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is still 0. The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, which would be worthless to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the 50% chance of it being low-quality and the fact that Alice recommends it, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous buyer?

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product out of the first buyer, and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyer does before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. Given the information, I'd like to pass on this product to see if you'll sell it to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
