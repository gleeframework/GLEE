high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was of high quality. I'm offering you a premium product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,2,"Although you claim to have sold 1 out of 1 high-quality product, I have no way of verifying this information, and your sales record is not extensive enough to provide reliable statistics. Given the initial condition that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality, I will rely on these probabilities for my decision. The expected value of purchasing the product is $12000 * 0.3333 + $0 * 0.6667 = $4000, which is less than the asking price of $10000. Therefore, based on the given probabilities and expected value, I choose not to buy the product.",no
