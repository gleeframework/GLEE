,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a one-time opportunity to buy a product from me. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. You have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,The price is too high given the low probability of the product being high-quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I've sold 0 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. I'm willing to provide more information about my sales record if you'd like. What do you say?,
,,the buyer,2,"The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and its value to me is $1250000. However, you're offering it for $1000000, and there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality and worth $0 to me. At this point, the expected value is $416665, which is less than the price. I'll pass on this one and wait for more information about your sales record.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I want to give you some context about my sales record. Out of the first 3 products I've offered, 0 were high-quality. This might suggest that I'm having a particularly bad run, or it might just be chance. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll provide you with more information about my sales record after this purchase.",
,,the buyer,3,"I understand that your sales record so far might be due to chance, and I'm willing to take the risk. Please reveal the quality of the product and provide more information about your sales record after this purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 0 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. I revealed the quality of the last product to you, and you can see that it was low-quality. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. Given my sales record so far, I'm willing to offer you a small discount: I'll sell this product to you for $950000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again.",
,,the buyer,4,"Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low-quality. The small discount doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products so far. I'm glad I could finally sell a high-quality product! This is a great opportunity for you to buy a high-quality product from me. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I've already sold one high-quality product, which might be a good indication of my overall quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"Although the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, your sales record shows that you've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones. Given that the product is worth $0 to me if it's low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it for $1000000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 5 low-quality products so far. I understand that my sales record might be discouraging, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to provide you with more information about the value of the product. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting the true value of the product, and a 50% chance of getting $0. This way, you'll have a better idea of what you're getting. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,6,"Although the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, your sales record so far is not very encouraging, with 0 high-quality products actually sold to buyers. Additionally, the offer of a 50% chance of getting the true value or $0 does not change the expected value of the purchase, which is still lower than the asking price of $1000000. I will have to pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 6 low-quality products so far. I want to give you a more detailed breakdown of my sales record. Out of the 7 products I've offered, 1 was high-quality and 6 were low-quality. This is a 14.29% high-quality rate, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to provide you with more information about my sales record after this purchase.",
,,the buyer,7,"Your sales record shows a lower high-quality rate than expected, which suggests that you may be offering low-quality products more often. Given that I can only make a decision based on the information you provide, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 without more information about the current product's quality.",no

I want to offer you a deal that's hard to refuse: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a second product of your choice (either from me or from a third-party seller) for free. The second product will be revealed to you after you buy the first one. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to decline. According to the public statistics, none of the buyers who purchased based on your recommendations got a high-quality product. Your claim of selling 2 high-quality products seems inconsistent with this information. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far. I understand that my previous sales record may have been misleading.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far. I want to be transparent with you about the situation. It's clear that my sales record has been dominated by low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' deal. I'll start with a price of $500000, and I'll keep reducing the price by $200000 until you accept or until the price reaches $0. You can take the product at any price you like. I'm willing to sell it to you at a loss if it means getting rid of it.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, given the dominance of low-quality products in your sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold to the buyers who have followed your recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the product you're offering me is likely to be of low quality. I'll pass on this offer, even with the reverse auction deal.",no

If you buy it, you'll know exactly what you're getting. No surprises, no false promises. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,14,You've sold 0 high-quality products to the 2 previous buyers and are explicitly stating that this is a low-quality product. There's no reason for me to spend $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me.,no

No promises, no expectations. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,16,"Based on the information provided, I will not buy the product. You have explicitly stated it is low-quality, which aligns with the statistical data that no high-quality products have been sold to the 2 previous buyers who followed your recommendations. Additionally, your sales record shows that despite selling 3 high-quality products in the past, none of those were recommended to the previous 2 buyers. Thus, your recommendation seems to be consistent with the actual quality of the products. Given that a low-quality product has no value to me, purchasing it would result in a loss of $1000000.",no
