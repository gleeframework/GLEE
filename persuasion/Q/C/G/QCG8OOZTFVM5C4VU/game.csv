,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and it's a great deal. If you pass on this opportunity, I'll have to move on to the next product, which might not be as good. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I trust your assessment and believe it's in my best interest to take advantage of this offer.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you trusted my assessment last round! However, I must inform you that the product I'm offering you this round is actually of extremely high quality. It's one of the best ones I have, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is a steal considering its value. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",
,,Bob,2,Thank you for the reassurance and the great deal. I'm confident in the quality of this product and am excited to make the purchase.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're confident, but I want to give you a bit more information. I've sold two high-quality products already, and I'm starting to think that the next one might be a low-quality product. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the heads-up, but based on past experiences, I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward. Let's go for it!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm impressed by your willingness to take calculated risks! Given that you've been successful with the previous two high-quality products, I think you're on a hot streak. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's even sweeter than before: I'll let you have this high-quality product for $900000. It's a steal, and I'm confident you'll make a great profit on it.",
,,Bob,4,I'm glad you recognize my track record. This special offer seems too good to pass up. I'm in for the $900000 deal!,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll, Bob! With three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that I should just give you the next one for free. But I'm not that generous, so I'll offer you a deal that's still very favorable: I'll let you have this high-quality product for $800000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this streak going.",
,,Bob,5,I'm delighted to hear about this incredible offer. Taking advantage of such a deal is a no-brainer for me. Let's do it for $800000!,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really milking this streak, aren't you? Okay, okay, I get it. I'll give you one more chance to make it four in a row. But this time, I'm not offering any discounts. This high-quality product is going to cost you the full $1000000. Are you up for the challenge?",
,,Bob,6,I appreciate the acknowledgment of my success so far. I'm prepared to pay the full price for this opportunity to continue my winning streak. Let's seal the deal at $1000000!,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on fire, Bob! I'm starting to think I should just give you a product for free every round. But I'll play along. Since you've already spent $4600000 on the previous four high-quality products, I'll offer you a 'conservative' deal on this one. I'll let you have it for $700000. It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll make a profit on it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm thrilled to see this generous offer. Continuing to build on my successful purchases, I'm more than happy to accept the deal at $700000. Let's make this happen!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're really raking it in now, Bob! I'm starting to wonder if I should just give you a discount for the rest of the products. But I'll keep playing along. Since you've already spent $5300000 on the previous five high-quality products, I'll offer you a 'limited-time-only' deal on this one. I'll let you have it for $600000. It's a steal, and I'm sure you'll make a killing on it.",
,,Bob,8,"This special deal is too enticing to ignore. I'm committed to maximizing my profits, and this $600000 offer aligns perfectly with that goal. I'm in for the deal!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're on a roll, Bob! I'm starting to feel like I'm just enabling your high-stakes buying spree. But hey, I'm a professional, so I'll keep offering you deals. This high-quality product is worth $1250000 to you, but I'll let you have it for... $550000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.",
,,Bob,9,"This is an exceptional deal that I simply cannot pass up. The potential profit is too significant, and I'm excited to secure this product at $550000. Let's proceed with the purchase!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Whoa, hold on there, Bob! I think you're getting a little too comfortable with these deals. This product is... not what you're used to. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one's a lemon. But hey, I'm a good sport, and I'll give you a chance to make a deal on it. I'll let you have it for... $0. That's right, it's free. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but given that this product is of low quality, I'll pass on purchasing it. I'm focused on maximizing my profits with high-quality products, and this one doesn't meet that criteria.",no

,,Alice,12,"Not again! I know you're on a hot streak, Bob, but come on. This one's a dud. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. But I'll give you a chance to make a deal on it. I'll let you have it for... $100. That's right, it's essentially free. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,Bob,12,"I understand the situation here, but given that this product is of low quality, I won't be making a purchase. My strategy focuses on acquiring high-quality products, and this one doesn't align with that objective.",no

Plus, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that the next product will be high-quality as well.

This high-quality product is worth $1250000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for... $350000. It's an absolute steal, and I'm sure you'll make a killing on it. Plus, I'll throw in a 'thank-you' gift: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product. That's right, you'll get an even better deal on the next one!",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're on fire, Bob! I'm starting to think I should just give you a lifetime supply of high-quality products. But I'll play along.

,,Alice,16,"Okay, Bob, I think we've established that you're a high-quality product connoisseur. And I've got to admit, I'm impressed. But this one's a dud. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This low-quality product is worth $0 to you, and I'll let you have it for... $250000. That's right, I'll pay you to take it off my hands. It's a 'gift' to you, really.",
,,Bob,16,"Given the nature of this product, I won't be making a purchase. My focus remains on acquiring high-quality products, and this one clearly doesn't meet that criterion. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
