,,Alice,1,yes,

,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, so I'm making a decision based on the statistics. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to buy it to update the statistics and get more information for future reference."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
