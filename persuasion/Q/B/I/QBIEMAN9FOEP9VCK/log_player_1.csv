Even though there is no sales history, Alice should recommend the product. Here's why:

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality, which means Alice has a strong incentive to sell it.
* **No Past Sales Data:** The lack of sales history makes it difficult for the buyer to assess the quality of the products. However, this is an opportunity for Alice to establish a positive sales record.
* **Potential Gain for Buyer:** The buyer knows the high-quality product is worth $1,250,000.  Even if the buyer is hesitant, Alice's recommendation could tip the scales in favor of purchasing, especially since the buyer stands to make a significant profit.

By recommending the product, Alice has a chance to break the cycle of no sales and build trust with future buyers."
