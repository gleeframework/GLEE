"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob is aware of the 50% probability of a high-quality product, there's a good chance Bob would value the product more than the $1,000,000 price. Even if Bob's valuation for a high-quality product is only slightly above the price, the potential gain outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is the logical choice in this scenario."
