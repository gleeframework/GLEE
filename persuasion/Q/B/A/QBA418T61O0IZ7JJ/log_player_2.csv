"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential profit from a high-quality product is significant ($200,000). In the first round, it makes sense to take the risk and see what the product is like.  This will also give you a sense of how Alice's recommendations work."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm a bit hesitant after your last recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk right now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation in the first round was accurate.  This suggests she might have some insight into the quality of the products.  Since she's not recommending this one, it's probably a good idea to err on the side of caution, especially given the potential for a complete loss."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations seem to be accurate, but we don't know how much weight to give them. It's too early to form a strategy based on just two rounds.  By asking for more information, we can try to gauge how reliable her recommendations are and what criteria she's using."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been consistently accurate, even though we don't know her reasoning. We've seen several low-quality products, and now she's recommending a purchase.
