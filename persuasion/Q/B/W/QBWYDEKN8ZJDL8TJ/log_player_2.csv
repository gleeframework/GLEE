Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in this product. However, I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 1 product I've sold so far, 1 of them was high-quality. This means there's a 33.33% chance that this product is high-quality as well. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount considering its potential value. Take the risk and make a profit, or walk away. The choice is yours!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the 33.33% chance of this product being high-quality and the potential value of $30,000, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10,000.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to point out that you've just seen 2 consecutive low-quality products. This might be a coincidence, but it could also indicate a shift in the distribution of products. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a calculated risk, but it could pay off big if you're lucky!

Alice's message: I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should converge to the true probability over time. Given that we've already seen a high-quality product, it's possible that the next one could be low-quality. But if you're willing to take the risk, I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a valuable item at a discounted price, but it's not a guarantee.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 products so far, with 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to work in our favor. With 2 high-quality products out of 4, the ratio is already higher than the true probability. This could indicate that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a valuable item at a discounted price, and the odds might be in your favor.
