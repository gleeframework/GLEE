,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. Given the product's 50% chance of being high or low quality, the expected value is $15000 (0.5 x $30000 + 0.5 x $0). However, the asking price is $10000 less than the expected value of a high-quality product but still not enough information to tilt my decision towards buying."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no way to verify the quality of the product or Alice's recommendations. Given the product's 50% chance of being low-quality and worth $0, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $10000 without more information."
