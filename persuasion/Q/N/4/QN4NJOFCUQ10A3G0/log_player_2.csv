"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fraction of its true worth. I'm confident you'll be pleased with this investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying this product at this price. I'll wait for more information about the product's quality before making a decision.""}"

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying this product at any price. I know it's a low-quality product and it's not worth $1,000,000 to me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'additional features' and I'm not willing to pay $900,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $950,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me, even if I think it might be high-quality. I'll wait for more information.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience. Let me ask you this: are you willing to consider a 'test drive' of sorts? I'll let you have this product for $500000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, we can part ways amicably. You'll only be out a fraction of the original price, and you'll have the opportunity to learn more about the product without breaking the bank.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a 'certified used' version of a product that I already know is low-quality. The price is still too high, and I'm not going to pay $250,000 for something that's worthless to me.""}"
