high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fraction of its true worth. I'm confident you'll be pleased with this investment.,
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying this product at this price. I'll wait for more information about the product's quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious. This product is a unique opportunity to test the waters and get a feel for the market. It's a low-risk, low-cost way to dip your toes in. I'm willing to let you have it for $1000000, a price that's essentially a token investment.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying this product at any price. I know it's a low-quality product and it's not worth $1000000 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is not the same product as before. This one has some... let's call them 'additional features' that might make it more appealing. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000, a significant discount from the original price.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced by the 'additional features' and I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy negotiator. I'll tell you this: I've been in the business long enough to know that sometimes you have to take calculated risks to reap the rewards. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for $950000. It's a fair price, considering the potential upside.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to pay $950000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me, even if I think it might be high-quality. I'll wait for more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience. Let me ask you this: are you willing to consider a 'test drive' of sorts? I'll let you have this product for $500000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, we can part ways amicably. You'll only be out a fraction of the original price, and you'll have the opportunity to learn more about the product without breaking the bank.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in the 'test drive' proposal. I know the product is either high-quality or low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've been trying to get you to take a chance on this product, but I understand your concerns. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750000? It's a compromise, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not willing to pay $750000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'm not going to overpay, even if you're willing to take a loss.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your position, Bob. I'll make you a one-time offer: I'll sell you a 'certified used' version of this product, which I've had thoroughly inspected and verified to be of the lowest quality. It's a steal at $250000. You can't pass up a deal like this.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a 'certified used' version of a product that I already know is low-quality. The price is still too high, and I'm not going to pay $250000 for something that's worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to part with this product for essentially nothing. I'll give it to you for $1. I'll even throw in a free gift: a nice pen. It's a $1000 pen, but I'll let you have it with the product. It's a $1000000 value for just $1.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in paying $1 for a product that's worthless to me, no matter what the 'free gift' is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is a complete loss for me. I'll just give it to you. It's free. I'm not even asking for a penny. Take it and consider it a gift.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Well, I guess I got a little too used to throwing things away. Let me start fresh. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to fall for the same old sales pitch. I know the odds are still 66.67% that it's a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.",no
