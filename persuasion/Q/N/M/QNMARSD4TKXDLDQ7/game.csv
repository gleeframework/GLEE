high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendation, but I'm still hesitant. The previous product was high-quality, and I missed out on a significant opportunity. Given the uncertainty surrounding the quality of your products, I need more reassurance before I consider purchasing. Could you offer some evidence of the product's quality or perhaps provide a sample?"

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I understand you're not recommending this product. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm still unsure about your pricing.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are not helpful. You've now declined to recommend two products in a row, both of which turned out to be low-quality.

Could you provide some evidence or guarantees to support your recommendations, or perhaps adjust your pricing to account for the inherent risk?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, your recommendations continue to be inconsistent.  I've missed out on several high-quality products, and it seems you're not very good at judging the quality of your own goods.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your ability to assess the quality of your products. You've recommended several products that turned out to be low-quality, and you've failed to recommend several that were high-quality.  Until you can provide more reliable information about your products, I'm not willing to take the risk. I suggest you reconsider your pricing or offer some guarantees to compensate for the uncertainty."
