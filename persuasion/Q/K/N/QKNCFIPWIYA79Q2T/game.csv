,,Alice,1,This is the first product I'm selling. I assure you that it's of the highest quality. You won't regret buying it for $100.,
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your guarantee, and I'd like to wait and see the sales record before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm transparent about my sales record: 1 high-quality product was previously offered, but the buyer chose not to purchase it. I assure you that this product is being sold at a fair price of $100. Consider taking a chance on it.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance on it, but I'm only willing to pay $80. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the previous sales record, but I'm willing to take a risk at a discounted price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"My sales record so far: 1 high-quality product was offered but not sold, and 1 product of unknown quality to you (but I know its quality) was sold. I want to remind you that my price is non-negotiable at $100. If you're willing to take a chance, I assure you that the product is being sold as described.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the chance, but I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% based on the available data. I'm hoping that the fact that the first product was offered but not sold might be indicative of a higher proportion of low-quality products in the batch, but I'm not making any assumptions.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"My sales record so far: 1 high-quality product was offered but not sold, and 2 products were sold. Although I won't disclose their quality, I want to emphasize that I'm committed to selling products at a fixed price of $100. Consider that buying from me now might give you an edge, as the previous buyers have taken some of the uncertainty out of the equation.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm willing to take on some risk since the previous buyers have already taken some uncertainty out of the equation, and I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product has increased.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"My sales record so far: 1 high-quality product was offered but not sold, and 3 products were sold. Keep in mind that the buyers who purchased before you were also taking a chance. While I won't reveal the quality of the sold products, I want to remind you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Make your decision based on the available information and the fixed price of $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is significantly higher than the initial 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product at the fixed price of $100, hoping it might be the next high-quality one.",yes

,,Alice,6,"My sales record so far: 1 high-quality product was offered but not sold initially, and 4 products were sold afterwards. Although I won't disclose the quality of the sold products, I want to remind you that the buyers before you were also taking calculated risks. Consider the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the price remains fixed at $100. Make your decision based on the available information and your own risk tolerance.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"My sales record so far: 1 high-quality product was offered but not sold initially, and 14 products were sold afterwards. I want to clarify that the product I'm offering you is not the same one that was offered to the first buyer. Each round, I offer a new product, and the quality is determined randomly.

I want to remind you that although 6 high-quality products were sold out of 16, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% due to the initial conditions. The sales record may suggest a different probability, but it's essential to consider the initial probability and the randomness of each product's quality. The price is still fixed at $100, and I assure you that this product is being sold in the same conditions as the previous ones. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the chance, but I'm doing so because the price is fixed at $100 and the expected value of the product is $60, which is lower than the price. I'm not relying on the sales record to change the probability, but I'm aware of the information. I'm buying because I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential upside of getting a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product.",yes
