low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the expected value of the product, which is 50% chance of $30000 and 50% chance of $0. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to decline the offer. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the product pool is biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like you to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for a product that's more likely to be high quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm going to make a decision based on the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the recommendation is biased by the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first 3 buyers were likely to buy regardless of the quality, and she's trying to maximize her sales. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product is higher than the 1/3 I'd expect given the sales record, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the 5th buyer. I'd like to understand the reasoning behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. The fact that you recommended me to buy this product doesn't necessarily mean it's high quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
