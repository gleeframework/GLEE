I'd be happy to share that the neutral buyer received a high-quality product, but unfortunately, it didn't quite meet their expectations.

I want to assure you that this product, on the other hand, is a low-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'm willing to offer a special deal: if you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,

Upon reviewing the data, I noticed that the 2 buyers who passed on the high-quality products were actually offered products that were not high-quality. The 2 buyers who passed on the low-quality products were offered low-quality products, which is consistent with the overall 20% chance of receiving a low-quality product. The 2 buyers who passed on the high-quality products were offered products that were actually low-quality, which is an anomaly. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, and I'm confident you'll be one of the satisfied customers. What do you think?",
