low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it, which makes me suspect it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than 0, and I can get a $300 product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know if you have any insight into why you're not recommending it, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product and 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products, I'm going to pass on it. I'm assuming that if a high-quality product was sold, you would have recommended it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I will pass on the product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian, and I think I can make a profit by going against your advice."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product being low quality, so I'll pass on it."
