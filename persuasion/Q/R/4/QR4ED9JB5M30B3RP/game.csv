But I will say that my success rate is still at 100% - I've sold 3 out of 3 products, and I'm feeling good about the quality of this one too. It's still $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to be a part of my streak. What do you think?",

That being said, I still believe this product is of high quality, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to be a part of my streak.

That being said, I still believe this product is of high quality, and I'm willing to give you a subtle hint: I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but I've only sold a total of 5 products so far. This might be a clue about the overall quality of my products... or it might not be. The price is still $100. What do you think?",

That being said, I still believe this product is of high quality, and I'm willing to offer you a gentle nudge: I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. The price is still $100. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 7 out of 7 products, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a groove. But I want to be upfront with you - I've been selling a lot of high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting lucky. That being said, I still believe this product is of high quality, and I'm willing to offer you a more direct hint: I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and I've only sold 7 products total. This might mean that my products are actually really good, or it might mean that I've just been getting lucky. The price is still $100. What do you think?",

,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 8 out of 8 products, and I'm starting to feel like I'm on autopilot. But I want to be honest with you - I'm starting to worry that I might be overconfident. I've been selling high-quality products for a while now, and I'm not sure if I'm just getting complacent. That being said, I still believe this product is of high quality, and I'm willing to offer you a more nuanced hint: I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, and I've only had 1 chance to sell a low-quality product (which didn't happen).

,,Alice,10,"I've now sold 9 out of 9 products, but I'm about to give you a reality check. I've been selling high-quality products for a while now, and I think it's time to mix things up. Let me be upfront with you - I've had a great run, but I'm not perfect. In fact, I've got a secret for you: I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, but I've only sold 9 products total. This means that I've actually sold 0 low-quality products so far, which is a pretty impressive feat. But it also means that I've been playing with a very small sample size. The price is still $100, but I want to warn you that I'm not getting any younger, and my streak might be due for a correction. What do you think?",
