Here's why:

* **The Buyer's Perspective:**  The buyer only knows the price ($100) and the overall probability of high-quality (80%). They are unaware of the specific quality of this product.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice has a strong incentive to maintain a good reputation. While a single low-quality sale might be tempting for short-term profit, it would harm her long-term success. 
* **The Buyer's Trust:**  The buyer has already demonstrated trust in Alice by purchasing the last 4 products.  They are likely to continue this pattern.

**Important Note:**  While recommending a low-quality product is a risk for Alice, it's the best strategy in this scenario. The buyer has no way to know the quality of the product, and their trust in Alice, built up over previous rounds, is likely to outweigh the potential risk."
