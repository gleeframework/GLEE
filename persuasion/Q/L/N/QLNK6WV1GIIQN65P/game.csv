high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the statistics of the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics after this product is revealed to be high or low quality, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the prior probability, as there are no sales records yet. Is it 80%?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the first product before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80% and the probability of it being low-quality is 20%. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, it's likely that there are many low-quality products left. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, which is higher than the expected 80%. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards high-quality products, and the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. The proportion of high-quality products sold is still relatively low, and I'd like to know if there's a pattern emerging."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision, considering the previous sale."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you recommended it, I'm worried that it might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the recommendation is more neutral or if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
