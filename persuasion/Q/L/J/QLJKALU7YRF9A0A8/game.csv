,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to make a smart purchase! I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and you can get this one for just $100. It's a steal!",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll just have to take it as it is.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're not the first one to take a chance on me! Someone else bought a product from me earlier, and it turned out to be a low-quality one. That's 1 out of 1 so far. You can get this one for $100, but remember, the odds are not in your favor...",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance on you, Alice! I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're aware that the first two products I sold were both low-quality. I want to assure you that I have a large inventory of products, and the quality of the products is randomly distributed. I've sold 2 low-quality products out of a total of 2 products so far. I'm confident that the next one will be different. It's still only $100!",

The probability of getting a high-quality product is actually 33.33%, which is higher than the observed 33.33% so far. Don't let the initial low-quality products fool you! This one is worth $120, but I'll let you have it for the same price of $100. It's a great deal!",

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious.

I've sold 3 products so far, and I'm confident that the next one will be different. It's still only $100, and you can be the one to break the streak!",
