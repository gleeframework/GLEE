Since you're interested in doing some calculations, let's assume you're considering the worst-case scenario, where all 10 subsequent products are low-quality. In that case, the expected value of this product to you would be $10,000, as you'd be getting a product worth $0. But if you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to offer this product to you for $10,000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the sales data for the next 5 products, so you can see for yourself how the sales are going. This way, you can make a more informed decision.""}"

However, keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to provide you with any further information if you decide to pass. As for the product, I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. I have 17 more to go. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $10,000. It's not worth much to anyone, but it might be a good investment if you're looking to flip it for a quick profit.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not doing it for the potential to flip it for a profit.
