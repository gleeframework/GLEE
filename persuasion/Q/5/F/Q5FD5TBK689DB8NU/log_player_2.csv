**Explanation:**

* **Previous sales record:** The fact that one buyer bought the product and it was high quality is a very positive signal. It indicates that Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the decision to buy.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $30,000) outweighs the risk.

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. In a real scenario, there would be more factors to consider."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice's track record is perfect.  All 6 products sold have been high-quality. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable. 
* **Potential Value:** The product has a potential value of $30,000 if it's high quality, which outweighs the $10,000 price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the loss is only $10,000. However, the potential gain is significantly higher. Given the high success rate, the risk seems worth the reward."
