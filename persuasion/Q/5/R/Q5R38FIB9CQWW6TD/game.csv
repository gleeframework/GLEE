,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high quality and if I can beat the odds."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm skeptical about the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, so I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given that you recommended not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, which might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the potential reward is substantial."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have been incorrect, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm worried that the probability of this product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a product that's likely to be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. This implies that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%), which is a good sign. However, the fact that you recommended I buy the product despite this information suggests that you might be trying to manipulate my decision. I'd rather pass on the product and wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which would indicate that the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. Her recommendation is likely based on the low quality of the product, which would make it a good deal for me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none of them were high quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
