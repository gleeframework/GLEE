high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you because I think you'll appreciate its value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. To be transparent, I'll tell you that I've been in the business for a while, and I've had some... let's call them 'learning experiences' with other products. This one, however, is a bit of an outlier. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from its usual price. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do think this product has some hidden value that might not be immediately apparent. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced. You're trying to sell me a high-quality product at a discounted price, but I don't know why you're willing to sell it so cheaply. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not one of my best offerings. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm trying to be transparent about its value. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm not expecting you to take my word for it. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a small 'warranty' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $250000 refund. That way, you'll have some protection against the possibility that I'm trying to sell you a lemon.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to be transparent, but I'm still not convinced. The warranty you're offering is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to make up for the uncertainty. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're still hesitant, and I respect your caution. I'll make a counteroffer: I'll sell you this product for $750000, and I'll throw in a 'best efforts' guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the product's performance, I'll work with you to resolve any issues and make it right. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm willing to stand behind it and help you get the most out of it. This is as low as I'm willing to go on the price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value you'll get.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, but I'm still not convinced. I'm not sure what kind of 'best efforts' guarantee you're offering, and I'm not comfortable committing to a purchase without more information about the product's quality. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand that you're still unsure, and I'm not trying to pressure you into a purchase. However, I want to make one thing clear: I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products. If you're not willing to take a chance on this one, I'll stop offering it to you, and we can move on to the next product. I'm not going to give you a better offer, and I'm not going to sugarcoat the fact that this product is not my best work. If you're still not interested, I'll just move on to the next round. Your choice.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not willing to take a chance on this product. I'd like to move on to the next round and see what other options you have available.",no

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is the same price I offered in Round 1. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price because I think you'll truly appreciate its value.

However, I'm not going to pressure you into a purchase. If you're not willing to take a chance on this one, I'll just move on to the next round. But before I do, I want to remind you that I've already offered you a high-quality product at a fair price, and you've passed on it. If you're still looking for a good deal, you might want to reconsider what you're looking for in a product.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're excited about the offer, but I think you might be getting a little ahead of yourself. You've already bought three products from me, and I want to make sure you're not getting too comfortable. This next product is indeed high-quality, but I'm not willing to give you another discount. The price is $1250000, and I'm not budging. I think you'll be happy with this product, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to take advantage of you.
