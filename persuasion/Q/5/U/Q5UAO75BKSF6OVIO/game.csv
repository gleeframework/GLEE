,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, and I'm the first one to see the product after Alice's recommendation. I'm not influenced by her recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous 5 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous 5 buyers purchased high-quality products. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you're not recommending it might actually make it more likely to be high quality, since you would have recommended it if it was low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows the quality distribution and might be biased towards recommending low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the previous 7 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is suspiciously low. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will make a different decision.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 8 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
