,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the current product. I understand that Alice doesn't have any information about my preferences, so her recommendation doesn't influence my decision.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of them found a high-quality product.
