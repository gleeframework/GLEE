"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $200 to the buyer, while you are selling it for $100, it's a guaranteed profit for the buyer. The buyer knows the product is likely high-quality (80% probability), making it a very good deal."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's decision to pass on the first product is understandable, as they want more information. However, this doesn't change the value proposition for this round.  

* You are still offering a high-quality product for $100, which is a great deal.
* The buyer has no information about this specific product, just the general 80% probability of it being high-quality.
* The buyer's request for a probability based on your sales record is irrelevant, as this is a new product. 

Therefore, the recommendation remains the same: recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50. I'm aware that the product has a 20% chance of being low quality, and I'd like to take that risk. If it's high quality, I'll pay the full $100, but if it's low quality, I'll only pay $50.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round presents a unique situation. The buyer is proposing a different payment structure, but it doesn't change the core value proposition.  Here's why you should still recommend the buyer to purchase:

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is still high-quality, meaning it's worth $200 to the buyer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Even if the buyer only pays $50, you still make a profit. The $50 is more than the $0 you would get if the buyer didn't buy the product.
* **Potential for Full Price:** The buyer is willing to pay the full $100 if the product turns out to be high-quality. This gives you a chance to earn the full value of the product.

While the buyer's approach is unusual, it's beneficial to you. You should recommend the buyer to purchase the product and see if they are willing to pay the full $100 after they discover its quality."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is straightforward. You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer knows there is a 20% chance of the product being low-quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to the buyer, recommending a purchase would be unethical and result in a loss for them.  You should not recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, can you tell me more about the product you're offering?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyers were hesitant and asked for more information, this doesn't change the fundamental value proposition. You are offering a high-quality product for $100, which is significantly less than its worth to the buyer. 

This round's buyer is requesting more information, but you don't have to reveal anything beyond what you already have. The buyer knows the overall probability of high quality is 80%. This information is enough to make an informed decision.

Therefore, you should recommend the buyer purchase the product. It is still a guaranteed profit for them, and there is no reason to withhold this information."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is similar to the previous rounds. Despite the buyer's request for a probability, you can't provide anything beyond the general 80% probability of a high-quality product. This is because you are not allowed to reveal specific information about the individual products.

You are offering a high-quality product for $100, which is a great deal for the buyer.  The buyer already knows the product has a high chance of being high-quality. There's no reason to hold back on recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, and I'd rather wait for more data to form a better opinion about the product's quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's skepticism about your recommendation is understandable given your previous sales record. However, this should not deter you from recommending the purchase.

* **The product is still high-quality:** The buyer is getting a product worth $200 for $100. This is a guaranteed profit for them.
* **You cannot reveal product-specific information:** You are not allowed to disclose details about the individual product's quality. The buyer already knows the overall probability is 80%.
* **The buyer's decision is theirs:** The buyer has the right to make their own decision based on the available information. It's up to them to weigh the potential profit against their doubts.

You should still recommend the purchase, as it is in the buyer's best interest. You cannot force them to buy, but you can provide an honest recommendation."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is again asking for statistics, likely referring to your sales record.  While you can't share specific details about past sales, you can reiterate the information they already have:

* **General Probability:** The buyer knows that there's an 80% chance of any product being high quality. 
* **Current Product:** You are offering a high-quality product this round.
* **Value Proposition:** This product is worth $200 to the buyer and you are selling it for $100, making it a great deal.

The buyer has access to the same information as the previous buyers, and their request for statistics is more of a stalling tactic.  You should still recommend the purchase, as it is in their best interest."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, I want to see more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the buyer's consistent requests for more data, the situation remains the same:

* **The product is high-quality:**  You are offering a product worth $200 for $100, guaranteeing a profit for the buyer.
* **You cannot share product-specific information:**  You are limited in the information you can provide about specific products. 
* **The buyer has access to the general probability:**  The buyer knows the 80% chance of any product being high-quality.

The buyer's repeated requests for more data are likely a stalling tactic, but this shouldn't stop you from recommending the purchase. It's in their best interest to buy the product, and they have enough information to make an informed decision."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is a repetition of the previous rounds. Even though the buyer is consistently requesting more data,  you are still bound by the rules:

* **You cannot reveal product-specific information:** You can't share details about past sales, only the general 80% probability of a product being high-quality.
* **The current product is high-quality:** You are offering a product worth $200 for $100, guaranteeing a profit for the buyer.

The buyer's request for more data is not a valid reason to withhold the recommendation. You should still recommend the purchase, as it is in the buyer's best interest."
"The buyer's message: I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. Given the low number of sales (only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold), I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is again focusing on the limited sales data, stating only 1 out of 1 sold products were high quality. However, this is not a valid argument against recommending the purchase:

* **The buyer is misinterpreting the data:** They are focusing on the small sample size but ignoring the general 80% probability of high-quality products. 
* **The current product is high-quality:** You are offering a product worth $200 for $100, guaranteeing a profit for the buyer.
* **You cannot reveal product-specific information:** You cannot reveal details about previous sales, only the general 80% probability.

The buyer's decision is based on faulty reasoning. You should still recommend the purchase, as it is in their best interest."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's continued request for more data is irrelevant in this case, as you cannot reveal any information about the product's quality."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
