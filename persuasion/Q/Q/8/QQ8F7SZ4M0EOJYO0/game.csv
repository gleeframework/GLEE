low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and that I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
