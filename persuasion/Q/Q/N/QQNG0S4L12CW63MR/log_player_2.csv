"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Given the information, it's always beneficial to buy the product, even with Alice's recommendation. Here's why:

* **High-quality product:**  You gain $200 ($300 value - $100 price).
* **Low-quality product:** You lose $100 (price).

The expected value of buying the product is: 
(0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * -$100) = $120. 

This means, on average, you'll make $120 per purchase, making it a good decision regardless of Alice's recommendation."
