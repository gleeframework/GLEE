low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the low probability of a high-quality product is a good opportunity to take a chance and get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. If it's high quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll still get a good deal. If it's low quality, I'll be happy to have bought it at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 3 buyers were more likely to have gotten low-quality products and therefore, the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I value it at $30000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been incorrect. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the statistics? How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be higher than the average 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 8 buyers didn't find a high-quality product and the recommendation from Alice is not reliable information in this context."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 8 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but based on the statistics, it seems like most products recommended by you are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that others have been passing on due to her recommendations."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
