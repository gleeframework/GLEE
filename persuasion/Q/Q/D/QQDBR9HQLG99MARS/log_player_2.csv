Alice's message: Fine, I'll break it down for you. Let's look at the data: 3 high-quality products out of 15 total products. The probability of a high-quality product given 3 successes out of 15 is not 0%. In fact, it's around 20%. But, considering the streak of 2 high-quality products after the first 13 products, it's possible that the last 2 sales were a streak rather than the overall probability. This would imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 0%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but don't say I didn't warn you that it's a long shot.
