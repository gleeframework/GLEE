"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he should buy it. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.
* **Price:** The price is $10,000.
* **Profit:**  Bob expects to make a profit of $10,000 - $10,000 = $0.

While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product and losing $10,000, there's also a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and making a $10,000 profit.  This makes it a neutral decision in terms of expected value. 

**Important Note:** This is only the first round. If Alice continues to offer high-quality products, Bob might become more confident in buying them, even if the expected value remains the same."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in round 1. Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.

* **Expected Value:** (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.
* **Price:** $10,000.
* **Profit:** $10,000 - $10,000 = $0.

Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the previous round, this doesn't change the probability distribution for the current round.  The expected value remains the same, making it a neutral decision for Bob."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're two for two with your recommendations!  I'll buy it again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has experienced two high-quality products in a row, this doesn't change the fundamental probabilities of the game. The probability of a low-quality product is still 50%. 

* **Expected Value:** (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000
* **Price:** $10,000
* **Profit:** $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

However, in this round, the product is actually low-quality. This means Bob will lose $10,000 if he buys it. 

**Recommendation:** It's crucial for Bob to remember the probability distribution and not fall into the trap of assuming that the streak of high-quality products will continue.  He should not buy this product."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation this time. I'll pass on this one.

Round 4

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000
* **Profit:** $10,000 - $10,000 = $0

It's a neutral decision for Bob in terms of expected value, but since this product is high-quality, it is a good idea to recommend him to buy."
