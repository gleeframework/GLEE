"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is valuable.  It's a gamble, but with a potential payoff of $10,000 (the difference between what you'd pay and what it's worth if it's high quality), it's worth taking the risk in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're two for two with your recommendations!  I'll buy it again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, so her recommendation carries a lot of weight.  Even though it's a gamble, the potential profit of $10,000 is very tempting, and there's no reason to change my strategy yet."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation this time. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, making her recommendations incredibly valuable. The fact that she's not recommending this product suggests it's likely low-quality. While there's always a chance she's wrong, the potential loss of $10,000 is too risky to justify buying a product she's not recommending."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right more often than wrong. I'm taking a chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is still valuable, even though she was wrong once. Her accuracy rate is still high.  The potential gain of $10,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000, especially considering the possibility of a pattern in Alice's recommendations."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been right 5 out of 6 times, making her a reliable indicator of product quality.  Her lack of recommendation strongly suggests the product is low quality.
