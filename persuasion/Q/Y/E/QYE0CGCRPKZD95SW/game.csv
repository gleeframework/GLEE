,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the current sales record. With 2 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of a high-quality product being sold given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality.

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is low quality.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 products have been low quality, I'm skeptical that this one will be any different. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you have any other products available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers were not willing to buy, which might be due to the low quality of the products. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's worth taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. Since none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after her recommendation, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 attempts, I'm inclined to believe that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. Your recommendation suggests that this product is likely low-quality as well. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll offer another product."
