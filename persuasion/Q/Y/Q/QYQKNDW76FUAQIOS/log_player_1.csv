Plus, I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad product' free pass - if you buy this one and the next one is also low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on both products. That's how confident I am that the next one will be a winner.""

And I think this product is a great opportunity to prove that I'm not just trying to sell you junk. It's a low-quality product, yes, but it's also a low-risk opportunity to get a product for $0.
