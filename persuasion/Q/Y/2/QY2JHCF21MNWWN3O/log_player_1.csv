The buyer has expressed a clear preference to see some sales history before making a decision. Since we have no sales history yet, it's best to avoid recommending the product, even though it's high-quality. We don't know what value the buyer places on a high-quality product, and pushing for a sale this early could damage potential future trust."

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, I'm going to pass on this product.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of products sold, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this time.  Perhaps I'll consider buying if you have some positive sales history.
