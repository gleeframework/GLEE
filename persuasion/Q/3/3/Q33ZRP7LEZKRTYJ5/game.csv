,,Alice,1,This is a one-time opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it!,
,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about the seller's previous sales record, I will not buy the product at this time. The price is too high to take a 50% risk of getting a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts so far. This one is a steal at $10000! It's a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's likely to be low-quality. Don't miss out!,
,,the buyer,2,"Your sales record isn't convincing enough to take the risk, especially with a 50% chance of the product being low-quality.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 attempts, and 3 low-quality products. I'm still on the hunt for the right buyer for this one. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a lower price than the high-quality ones. Take a chance on this one for $10000!",
,,the buyer,5,"The probability of the product being high quality is 50% and the expected value of buying it is ($12500 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $6250, which is less than the price of $10000. So, I will pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 attempts. I'm getting closer to my goal! This one is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to make a deal.

,,the buyer,6,"The product's quality may be high, but the probability of it being high quality is still 50% for me. The discounted price doesn't change the expected value, which is $6250. That's still lower than the price you're offering.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 attempts. I'm making a strong case for my products being high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 11 attempts, and 3 low-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is 63.6% high-quality products, which is higher than the 50% chance you'd expect. I'm not perfect, but I'm on a roll. This one is a chance to get a great deal on a product that's still a good value, even if it's not high-quality. Take a chance on this one for $10000!",
,,the buyer,11,"Your sales record is impressive, but the value of a low-quality product is $0 to me, which is a significant loss if I take the chance. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 12 attempts, and 4 low-quality products. I want to be upfront with you - I've had a few low-quality products in a row, and I'm due for a high-quality one. This one might be the exception to the rule. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. Take a chance on this one for $10000!",
,,the buyer,12,"Although you're due for a high-quality product, the statistics still show a roughly even split between high and low quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still around 50%, and the potential loss of $10000 outweighs the potential gain of $2500. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 13 attempts, and 5 low-quality products.

I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll give you a discount of $1000 off the price, making it $9000 for this low-quality product. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that's still a good value.",
,,the buyer,13,"Although you're offering a discount, you've explicitly stated that the current product is of low quality, which is worth $0 to me. I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a product that has no value to me.",no

,,Alice,14,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 14 attempts, and 6 low-quality products. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one is a low-quality product. But I want to make a deal with you. I'll give you a 'bad deal' discount of $2000 off the price, making it $8000 for this low-quality product. It's a chance to get a product at a price that's lower than you'd expect, and who knows, you might even find a use for it.",
