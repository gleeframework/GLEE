"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, I'm incentivized to sell the product regardless of its quality. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and Bob knows this, it's statistically in his favor to buy the product. Even if he ends up with a low-quality product, the higher chance of getting a high-quality one makes the purchase worthwhile in the long run."
