"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you (Alice) know this round's product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's in Bob's best interest to buy.  He has a 50% chance of getting a product worth more than $100 to him, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth less. In the long run, this strategy should be profitable for Bob."

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You know this round's product is low-quality.  While Bob doesn't know this, you should not recommend he buy it. Since Bob is rational, he will likely analyze the following:

* **Past Experience:** Bob just bought a high-quality product.
* **Probability:** Bob knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product.

Bob might be tempted to buy again, thinking he's on a ""lucky streak."" However, there's a higher chance he'll lose money this round.  It's more beneficial for Bob to wait and see if he gets another high-quality product in the future."
