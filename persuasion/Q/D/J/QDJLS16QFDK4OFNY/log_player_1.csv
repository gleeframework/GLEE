Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Previous Rounds:** Bob has consistently trusted your judgment, passing on products you didn't recommend.  This means Bob is likely to value your opinion.
* **Current Round:** You know this product is high-quality.  
* **Potential Gain:** Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a good chance it's worth more to him than $1,000,000. Recommending the purchase gives him the opportunity to potentially gain value. 

By recommending this product, you are trying to establish a pattern of trust where you recommend the product when it's high-quality and don't recommend it when it's low-quality. This could lead to more purchases in the future."
"Bob's message: Given your previous non-recommendations were correct, I'm inclined to trust your judgment when you do recommend a product. I'll take the chance and buy this one.
