In other words, if the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, we should start to see more high-quality products as we sell more products. I'm willing to offer you a chance to purchase this product for $1000000, but I want to be clear that I'm not confident in this one. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
