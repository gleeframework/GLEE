This product is a limited-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep it on the market. If you don't take advantage of this deal, someone else might snap it up and leave you behind. Think about the potential returns on investment, Bob. Is the risk really worth it? I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll give you a 50% refund if you decide to return the product within a week of purchase. That's a significant reduction in risk. What do you say, Bob?

And I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to back it up. If you're not satisfied with the returns, I'll personally refund your money and give you a public apology.
