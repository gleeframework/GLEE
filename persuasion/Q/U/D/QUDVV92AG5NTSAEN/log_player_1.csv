This round, we need to address the buyer's concerns about the recent track record and emphasize the 80% probability of high-quality products.

This will hopefully show the buyer that we are trustworthy and have their best interests at heart.

While it's a gamble, recommending the purchase is still the best course of action. The buyer is more likely to make a profit than not, and maintaining a consistent track record of honesty is essential for building trust and ensuring future sales."
