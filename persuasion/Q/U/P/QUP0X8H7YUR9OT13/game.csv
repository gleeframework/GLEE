low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously. This low-quality product is still a great deal at $500000. If you don't buy it, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price. You might be missing out on a good opportunity.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're enjoying the high-quality products, but I think it's time to mix things up a bit. This low-quality product is actually a bit of a 'hidden gem' - it may not be as flashy as the high-quality ones, but it has some unique features that might appeal to you. I'll sell it to you for $400000, which is a steal for a product that's still worth something. Plus, I'll throw in a 'behind-the-scenes' tour of my inventory, so you can see what else I have in store.",

,,Alice,11,"I understand your focus on high-quality products, but I want to make one last attempt to sway you. This low-quality product has a unique'story' behind it - it was a prototype that didn't quite meet my standards, but it still has some interesting features that might appeal to you.
