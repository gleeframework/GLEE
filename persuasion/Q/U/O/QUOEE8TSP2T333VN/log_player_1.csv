"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a 50% chance of making a profit of $10,000 ($20,000 value - $10,000 price).  It's a good gamble in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Since I have no information about the product yet, I will not buy it to avoid the risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's logic in Round 1 is understandable given the lack of information. However, nothing has changed since then. This product is still high-quality, offering the same potential for profit.  While there's still a 50% risk of losing $10,000, there's also a 50% chance of gaining $10,000.  The odds remain the same."
"Bob's message: Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, I still don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation. I will wait for more rounds to see if Alice is honest or not.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, meaning Bob would lose $10,000 if they bought it. It's always a bad idea to recommend purchasing a low-quality product, even if there's a chance Bob might be swayed by the previous rounds.  The goal is to maximize Bob's profit, and buying a low-quality product goes against that goal."
"Bob's message: Since Alice doesn't recommend the product and I have seen her recommend high-quality products in the previous rounds, it's likely that this product is low-quality. I will not buy it to avoid the risk of losing $10000.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

Since this round's product is high-quality, it offers the same potential profit of $10,000.  Even though Bob might be becoming more confident, the odds of the product being high-quality are still 50%, making it a worthwhile gamble."
"Bob's message: Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far. She recommended high-quality products and didn't recommend a low-quality product. I will continue to trust her recommendation and buy the product.
