low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'll take my chances. Since 3 out of 5 products sold were high-quality, and you recommend buying this one, I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,I'll take my chances since the recommendation rate has been fairly reliable so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality given that Alice recommends it is not clear. However, given that only 3 out of 7 products sold were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendation does not necessarily guarantee a high-quality product. I will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,The probability of the product being high quality given that Alice recommends it is less than 50% since only 3 out of 7 products sold were high quality.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on your recommendation and the statistics of previous sales, I've decided not to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Given that the product's quality is uncertain and only 3 out of 7 products sold were of high quality, the probability of getting a high-quality product does not justify the risk of spending $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Since the probability of a product being high quality is 50% and only 3 out of 7 products sold were high quality, I don't have enough confidence in your recommendation to justify the purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold and your recommendation to not buy, I will pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current sales record, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/7, which is less than the expected 50% given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality. This discrepancy and the fact that Alice has a potential incentive to sell low-quality products given the fixed price, makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product despite Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but based on your past sales, it seems only 3 out of 7 products were high-quality, which is less than expected. Given the product's value is $0 if it's low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"The probability of the product being high quality is 50%, but based on your sales record, only 3 out of 7 products sold were high quality, which is less than the expected 50%. I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I've decided not to buy the product. Although you've recommended it, the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far (3 out of 7) is less than the expected 50%, which makes me skeptical about the quality of this product."
