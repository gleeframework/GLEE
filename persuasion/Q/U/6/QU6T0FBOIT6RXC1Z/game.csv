,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying the product. I want to make it clear that this is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm not willing to negotiate the price, but I'm willing to provide you with more information about the product. I can tell you that the quality of this product is confirmed to be high, and it's one of the best products I have in stock. If you're still interested, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is a $200000 value, absolutely free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I'm willing to provide you with more information to alleviate them. However, I must inform you that the quality of the product is indeed high, as I've confirmed it myself. I'm willing to offer you a money-back guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll refund the full amount of $1000000. This guarantee is only valid for this specific product, and it's not transferable. If you're still hesitant, I can also offer to let you inspect the product before buying it, but this would require a 10% deposit of $100000, which would be deducted from the purchase price if you decide to buy it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your efforts to alleviate my concerns, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $1000000 to me. The money-back guarantee is a good gesture, but it doesn't change my valuation of the product. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get more information or a better deal.",no

I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year maintenance package, worth $50000, and a 1-year subscription to our premium support service, valued at $20000. This is a significant value-add, and I think it's worth considering. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $500000 for a product that I don't think is worth that much to me.
