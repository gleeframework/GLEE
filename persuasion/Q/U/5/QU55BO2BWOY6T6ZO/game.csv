,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the pattern of 0 high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence and the next one will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy after your recommendation, which might indicate a bias in your recommendations.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 4 buyers were all recommended to buy and didn't get a high-quality product, or is there another reason?"

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd also like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a bias towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have rejected the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product and hope that the next one will be better."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended against it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of a potential bargain."

,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the current sales record suggests. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a different product."
