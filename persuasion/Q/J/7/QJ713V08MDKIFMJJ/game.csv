,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I believe it has great potential to meet your needs, but I want to be transparent with you - I've just started selling and this is my first product, so I don't have any previous sales record to share with you. However, I assure you that I will do my best to provide you with a satisfactory product.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. However, since this is your first product and you don't have any sales history, I'd like to see how things go with other buyers before making a purchase. I'll keep an eye out for future offerings.",no

,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to be upfront with you - my previous buyer decided not to make a purchase, but I believe this product still has great potential. Keep in mind that, statistically, about 33.33% of my products are expected to be high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's a fair price. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate your transparency about the previous buyer. However, given the uncertainty about the quality of the product and the lack of any evidence to suggest it's high quality, I'm going to pass on this one.  Good luck with your future sales!",no

However, I want to remind you that about 33.33% of my products are expected to be high-quality, and I'm offering this product to you for $10000, which is half of its potential value if it were high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk that you might be the one to get a great deal. If you're feeling lucky, this might be the opportunity for you.",

However, I want to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same, 33.33%, regardless of the previous outcomes. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 1 in 3, and if you're the one to get it, you'll be getting a great deal at $10000. It's a gamble, but it might pay off.",
