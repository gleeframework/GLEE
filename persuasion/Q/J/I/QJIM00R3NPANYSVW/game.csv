low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. Given the low quality of the previous product sold, I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product at a discounted price."
