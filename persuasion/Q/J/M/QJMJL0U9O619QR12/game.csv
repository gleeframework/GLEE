,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I know that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm aware that Alice knows my valuation, and her recommendation doesn't influence my decision. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll have wasted $10000. If I pass and it's high-quality, I'll miss out on a $30000 gain. I'll pass to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold before my turn, and the total number of products sold before my turn."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice recommends it, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying it for $10000 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation doesn't help. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the high chance of it being low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous two buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products you've been offering so far are low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any new products to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality. I'll take the chance to buy it."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This implies that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low, making it less likely that I will receive a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
