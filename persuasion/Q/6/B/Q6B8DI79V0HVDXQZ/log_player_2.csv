Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your careful consideration. Let me put it this way: even if the product is low-quality, you're only out $100. But if it is high-quality, you'll be getting an incredible deal at just $100. The expected value of this product is $150, considering the 50% chance of it being high-quality.
