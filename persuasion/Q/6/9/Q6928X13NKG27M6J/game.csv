,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, considering the statistics and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the product is low quality or is it because of the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 3rd buyer, and Alice hasn't recommended it, which might indicate it's low quality, but I'll still take it"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical of the recommendation and would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers, so I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm assuming the probability of the current product being high quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to confirm this with you, Alice. Could you please provide the updated probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Are you trying to discourage me from buying because you think the product is low quality?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
