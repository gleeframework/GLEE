low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product and it's possible that it's a high-quality one."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, and based on the previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high probability of it being low-quality and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide some reasoning behind your previous recommendation. As a third buyer, I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to understand your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to discuss the odds with you, Alice."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far were all low-quality. Since you don't recommend buying the product, I'm going to pass on it to see if it's high-quality. Maybe the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record, so I can make a more informed decision for my own purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see a better track record before trusting your judgment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, even though you don't recommend it."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from previous buyers and Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers chose to buy the products you recommended, I'm going to assume that the products you recommended were low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm going to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
