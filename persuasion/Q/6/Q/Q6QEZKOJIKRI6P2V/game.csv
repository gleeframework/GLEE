,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't get a high-quality product makes me skeptical. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, which would be a loss of $1000000.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account.
