,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about your sales record and the product's quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll wait for more information about your products.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I understand that trust needs to be built. I want to be transparent with you - the previous buyer didn't purchase the product, but I can assure you that it was a high-quality product, just like the one I'm offering now. I'm willing to start building my reputation with you. Take a chance and you'll see that my products are worth the investment. This product is truly exceptional and will bring you great value.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,

If you take a chance on this product, you'll not only get an amazing deal but also be one of the first to experience the quality I have to offer. Don't let this opportunity slip away!",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I understand the skepticism, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling only the best products. Although my sales record is empty, I've had four consecutive high-quality products, including this one. I'm willing to take a hit on my reputation if this product doesn't meet your expectations. However, I'm confident that it will exceed them. Consider this: if I were selling low-quality products, would I be so eager to sell and build a reputation? Take a chance and you'll see that my products speak for themselves.",
,,the buyer,4,"Although I appreciate your confidence in the product, I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. You have no sales record to back up your claims, and I'm not willing to take a $10000 risk based on your word alone.

I'm still building my reputation and I don't want to jeopardize it by making false claims. This product may not be the best I have to offer, and I want to caution you that it may not be worth the investment. If you're looking for a guaranteed high-quality product, I'd advise you to wait for my next offering. However, if you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as my previous products.",

Consider this: if my previous claims were false, would I still be confident in my products? I'm eager to prove myself, and I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to experience my commitment to quality. Take a chance, and you'll see that my products are worth the investment.",
,,the buyer,7,"Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm and commitment to quality. However, your sales record currently shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 sale.
