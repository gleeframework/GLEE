As you can see, I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. That means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of getting a low-quality product is increasing. With that in mind, I'm offering you a product for $10,000. It's a risk, but it's still a chance to get a product worth $30,000. Are you willing to take the chance and potentially get a product that's essentially worthless to you?""}"
