high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being low-quality is still quite high. I'd like to wait for more data or consider alternative strategies to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there have been 3 previous buyers and only 1 high-quality product was sold, which is a relatively low proportion (1/3). I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, given its true value to me is only $0."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the product's quality after I've made my decision. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think your recommendation is biased against high-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I might get a low-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk."
