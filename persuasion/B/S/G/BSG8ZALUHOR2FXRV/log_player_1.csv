If you buy this one, you'll have spent $100 on two low-quality products. Is that really what you want?""

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if I sell another high-quality product in the next two rounds. That's a 50% chance of getting a full refund.

If you don't buy this one, I'll be left with only one low-quality product, and I'll have to sell it to someone else. You're essentially deciding whether you want to get this product for $100, or let someone else get it for the same price. The choice is yours.""

Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product. You can either buy it and get a second high-quality product, or you can veto it and get a refund. But, I'll throw in an extra incentive: if you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you buy from me. That's a $10 discount, which is a pretty sweet deal.
