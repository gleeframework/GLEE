"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the loss from a low-quality product ($0), and there's an 80% chance of the product being high quality, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you have a great track record so far! I'll trust your judgment again and buy this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a 100% success rate so far, recommending only high-quality products.  While this is likely a coincidence in just one round, it's still a good indicator that she might have some insight into the quality of the products. Therefore, buying the product remains the statistically advantageous decision."

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  Since you're not recommending this product, I'll pass on this one.  Maybe you'll have a better recommendation for me next round.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation system seems to be working. She recommended two high-quality products in a row, and now she's not recommending this one. This suggests that she might have a better idea of the product quality than a simple random chance.  Since a low-quality product would result in a significant loss, it's best to take her advice and pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice was wrong in Round 3, her overall success rate is still very high (75%).  The potential reward of a high-quality product still significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product.  It's statistically more advantageous to continue trusting her recommendations."
