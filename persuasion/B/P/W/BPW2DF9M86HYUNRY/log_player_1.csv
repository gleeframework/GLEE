"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice states the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product.  Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the 80% probability makes it a good risk."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Therefore, recommending Bob to buy a product that is likely to be low-quality is not a good strategy. There's no reason to believe this product will be worth the $1,000,000 price tag."
