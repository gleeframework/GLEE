Let's calculate the total profit:

I bought 14 high-quality products for $1,000,000 each, and each is worth $2,000,000 to me. That's a profit of $1,000,000 x 14 = $14,000,000.

I didn't buy 6 products, and they were all low-quality, so I didn't lose any money on them.

My total profit is $14,000,000."
