  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm going to use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. Let's say the probability of a high-quality product being sold is x. Then, the probability of 4 low-quality products being sold in a row is (1-x)^4. The probability of 4 low-quality products being sold in a row given that 4 products were sold is (1-x)^4 / (1-x)^4 + x. Now, I'll calculate x using this equation.""
