,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 products to other buyers and neither of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%, and I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it's possible that all the previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
