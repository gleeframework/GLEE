}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not making a decision based on your sales record.

I'll be honest with you, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've been trying to sell you on the idea that I'm selling high-quality products more often than that. But I'm a seller, not a magician. I'll give you the real deal: I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality. Would you like to take the risk?""
