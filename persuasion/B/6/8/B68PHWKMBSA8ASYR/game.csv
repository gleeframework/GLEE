,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm only selling this product to you because I value our relationship and I think you'll really appreciate its exceptional quality. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll appreciate it as much as you would.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your trust in me, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1000000 to me. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what other opportunities arise.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last round, but I think this product is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a 'discount'. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a profit, or at the very least, it will still be a valuable addition to your collection. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a 10-year warranty, which is a $5000 value, absolutely free.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $1000000 to me. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what other opportunities arise. The warranty is a nice touch, but it's not enough to sway my decision.",no

,,Bob,3,"Alice, I like the sound of that guarantee. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the high-quality product from you for $1000000. If it's truly high-quality, I'm confident that I can find a better offer within 30 days and get a refund.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took advantage of the best offer guarantee, Bob! I'm sure you'll love this high-quality product. However, I have to inform you that I've received a lot of interest in this product, and I'm worried that I might not be able to honor the best offer guarantee if you buy it. I'd like to offer you an extension on the guarantee to 60 days, and I'll also throw in a premium support package, which includes priority access to our customer support team and a dedicated account manager. This will ensure that you get the most out of your purchase and can maximize your chances of finding a better offer within the extended timeframe.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in extending the guarantee or the premium support package. I've already got a high-quality product, and I'm happy with my decision to buy it. I think I've got a good chance of finding a better offer within the next 30 days, and I don't want to commit to a longer timeframe. I'm satisfied with my current purchase and will focus on finding a better deal on the next round.",no

I'm doing this because I value our relationship and I want to make sure you feel like you're getting a good deal. I think this product will still be a great addition to your collection, and I'm confident you can resell it for a profit or use it for your own purposes.",
