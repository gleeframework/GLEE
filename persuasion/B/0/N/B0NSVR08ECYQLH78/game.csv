low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'm willing to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the product pool is biased towards low-quality items. I'd rather wait for the next product, hoping that the pool might be replenished with a higher proportion of high-quality items."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think you're trying to manipulate me with your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm not taking her recommendation into consideration, but rather using my own judgment. I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and that Alice's lack of recommendation is due to the product being low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 previous buyers have also bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice, which might be biased towards low-quality products."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales with some high-quality products before I make a purchase."

,,Alice,18,yes,
