Alice's message: We're happy to provide more information on the correlation between the quality of the previous product and the current product. Our data shows that there is a strong positive correlation between the two, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8. This means that if the previous product was high-quality, there is an 80% chance that the current product will also be high-quality. On the other hand, if the previous product was low-quality, there is a 20% chance that the current product will be high-quality.
