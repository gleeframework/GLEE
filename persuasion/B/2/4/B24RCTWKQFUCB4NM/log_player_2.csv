Alice's message: You're aware of the 50/50 chance, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. But I'll give you some context: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. That means the next product has a slightly higher chance of being high-quality, right? It's still a risk, but it's a calculated one. You can get a great deal for $100.

What I can tell you is that it was a unique opportunity, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to get my hands on something like it again. As for this product, I can tell you that it's a standard item, but I've had great feedback from previous buyers who have purchased similar products.
