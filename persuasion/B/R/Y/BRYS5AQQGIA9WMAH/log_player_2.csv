"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $200 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and we know Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation gives us valuable information.  Even with an 80% chance of being high quality, it's a good bet to take, as the potential gain ($100) outweighs the potential loss ($100)."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling confident about this one!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation still holds value, even though we know she has no incentive to lie (she gets the same price regardless of quality). Since the product is more likely to be high quality, her recommendation reinforces that notion. The potential gain still outweighs the potential loss."
