Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was a high-quality one. Since you know the last product was high-quality, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, just like before. However, you also know that I've already sold a high-quality product, which means I have a 66.67% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next 19 rounds.
