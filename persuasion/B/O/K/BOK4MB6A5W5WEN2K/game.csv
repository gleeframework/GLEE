This product is a great opportunity to get a feel for the product line, and I'm confident you'll be able to evaluate its value accurately. What do you say?",

,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't know whether the product is high-quality or not. I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, even with a refund guarantee.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I want to offer you a different approach. Since you're not willing to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality, I'll give you a straight-up deal: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you before you make a decision.
