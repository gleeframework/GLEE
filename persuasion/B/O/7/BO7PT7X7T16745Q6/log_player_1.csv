Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a good chance he'll value it at more than $10,000. Recommending the purchase makes sense in this scenario."
