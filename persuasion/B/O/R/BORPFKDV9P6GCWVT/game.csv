,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high quality and will be worth the $1000000 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and what was the quality of the product sold to the previous buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is there a reason why it's not high quality based on past sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the next product being high quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold, as well as the number of buyers who have passed on the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good opportunity to acquire it at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it on the statistics or do you have some other information that I'm not aware of?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the products offered so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 1 out of 6 products sold was high quality, which is consistent with the 50% chance of a product being high quality. However, this information alone is not enough to update my prior belief about the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on your previous sales record, not on the quality of the product. I'm hoping to take advantage of the uncertainty and the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.
