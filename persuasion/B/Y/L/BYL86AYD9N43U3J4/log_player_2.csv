**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0), even with the 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Prior Information:** While the prior information on sales is limited, it does suggest that Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products, as one high-quality product has been sold.

**This is a gamble, but the potential reward justifies the risk.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm going to take a chance and buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a clear incentive to recommend high-quality products to maximize her sales. Her recommendation carries weight.
* **Previous sales data:**  The data suggests a high proportion of high-quality products sold (2 out of 2).  This reinforces the possibility of this product being high quality.
* **Potential gain vs. risk:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product is significant (worth $200 to you).  The odds are in your favor, based on the existing data. 

**Important Note:** This decision assumes that Alice is acting rationally to maximize her profits. If there's reason to believe Alice might be deceptive, the decision would need to be reevaluated."
