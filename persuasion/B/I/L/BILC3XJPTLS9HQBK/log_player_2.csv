"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending it, it's likely a high-quality product.  Even with the 50/50 chance, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  It's a good gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Another recommendation? I'm feeling lucky! I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a track record of making good recommendations. Since she recommended the product, it's reasonable to assume it's high quality again, given her knowledge. The potential reward of $12,000 is still significantly greater than the risk of losing $10,000, making it a worthwhile gamble."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a history of providing accurate recommendations, and she's not recommending this product.  This strongly suggests it's likely a low-quality product, which would result in a loss of $10,000.  It's best to play it safe and pass on this one."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's previous recommendation was correct: it was a low-quality product. This further strengthens the idea that she is trustworthy in her assessments.
