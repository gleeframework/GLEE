high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. This is lower than the expected 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know whether it's high or low quality."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far?

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm not confident that the product is high quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 80% I expect. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a low-quality product and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I think the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product was just lucky. I'd like to wait and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than expected."
