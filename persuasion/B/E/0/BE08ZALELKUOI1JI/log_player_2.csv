Alice's message: I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row. This is a concerning trend, and it's possible that I've run out of high-quality products. However, it's also possible that I've just been unlucky. I want to be transparent with you: I'm willing to offer a discount on this product. I'll sell it to you for $900000.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns. Given that I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 50%. However, I can provide you with a rough estimate of the expected value of the next product. Assuming I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, and considering the first 4 products were low-quality, the expected value of the next product is likely to be around $500000 (half of the original price). I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $900000, which is a 40% premium over the expected value. Please let me know if you'd like to take the risk and buy it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 4 low-quality products in a row, my intuition is that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%, possibly even lower than 40%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal.""

Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyer who decided to wait! I'm glad I could provide them with valuable information. Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product! I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, but that's not a guarantee that the next one will be low-quality. In fact, this one is a high-quality product.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row, and 1 high-quality product. This might suggest that the high-quality products are relatively rare. However, I still have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product in the future. Given the current streak, I'm willing to offer this product to you for $800000. This is a 20% discount from the original price, and it's a chance to get a potentially high-quality product at a lower price. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?
