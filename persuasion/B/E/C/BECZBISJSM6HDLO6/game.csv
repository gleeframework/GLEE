high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products recommended by the seller so far have been low quality, which suggests a bias in the recommendations. I'd like to wait for more data or a different recommendation from the seller before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and why you're advising me not to buy?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that all previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, it seems like your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy it to try to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I suspect that the products they were recommended to buy were low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 4 buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%. Alice's recommendation is against buying, but I'm not convinced that it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes based on the next buyer's decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/4 ratio of high-quality products sold, and I'm taking a calculated risk based on the 50% chance of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
