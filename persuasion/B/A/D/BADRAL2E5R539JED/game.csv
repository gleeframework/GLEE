low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first mover, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to gather data for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can see the product before I pay. I want to inspect it first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll save $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a pattern in your recommendations? Are you recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that the previous buyers passed on it. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian strategy, and I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find the product worth purchasing, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. Alice's recommendation does not change my decision, as I want to take advantage of the potential for a higher-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being sold so far, and I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 7 previous sales with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
