,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics, not your recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it.

I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually be a good sign, as it might mean that the product is low-quality."
