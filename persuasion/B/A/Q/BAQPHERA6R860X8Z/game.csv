,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm afraid the price is non-negotiable. I'm willing to give you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",

,,Alice,4,"I'll be upfront with you, Bob. I've had a few other interested buyers for this high-quality product, and I'm starting to lose interest in keeping it on the market.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to pay $1000000 for a product that you know is high-quality, but you don't know its exact value? If the answer is yes, then this product is a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, which is still a significant discount from the maximum price you're willing to pay.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing you a favor by offering it to you at this price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to sell it to anyone else at this price.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the previous product, and I want to assure you that this one is a high-quality item. However, I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's significantly lower than the maximum you're willing to pay. I'll let you have it for $925000, which is a 7.5% discount from the maximum price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to sell it to anyone else at this price.",

However, I'm willing to sell it to you at a very low price: $600000. This is a significant discount, and I'm not sure I'll be able to sell it to anyone else at this price. It's a last chance to get a good deal on a product that's still functional, even if it's not the best quality.",

But I'll make one last offer: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $550000, and I'll even throw in a 6-month warranty.
