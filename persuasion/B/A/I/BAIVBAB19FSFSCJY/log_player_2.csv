``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no data yet on product quality, the recommendation from Alice is not particularly helpful. However, the potential upside of buying a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential downside of buying a low-quality product ($0). This is a classic gamble where the expected value is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.3333 * $125) + (0.6667 * $0) = $41.66**

Therefore, it's statistically beneficial to buy the product, even without any information about its quality."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Probability:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies she believes the product is likely high quality. This increases the probability of a high-quality product.
* **Previous Sales Data:** 1 out of 1 previous sales was a high-quality product. This further strengthens the belief that the product is likely high quality. 

**Since the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0), it's a good bet to purchase.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a perfect track record so far, with all recommended products being high quality. This suggests a strong ability to identify good products.
* **Potential Value:** Even though the product has a 2/3 chance of being low quality, the potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.
* **Limited Information:** There's no way to know the quality of this specific product other than Alice's recommendation. Since Alice has proven to be reliable so far, it makes sense to trust her judgment."
