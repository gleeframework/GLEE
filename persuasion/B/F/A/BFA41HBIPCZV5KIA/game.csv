high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the quality of the product. I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the first buyer's decision to buy was influenced by the fact that they didn't have any information about the product's quality, and now that I have that information, I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, given that you recommended against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that others have somehow missed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering your previous recommendations have not been successful. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I think it's unlikely that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is no, not because I trust her. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product since none have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far have been low-quality. This increases my probability of getting a low-quality product, which is not worth $10000 to me. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. Can you tell me how many high-quality products have been sold out of the total number of products sold?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, did not end up buying a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if Alice is recommending it, it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 4 buyers who bought the product were all recommended to buy, which suggests that the high-quality products might have been sold already. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
