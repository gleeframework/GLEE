low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had a great response to my previous offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I want to be transparent with you - the last buyer was also excited, but unfortunately, the product didn't meet their expectations. I'm not sure what to expect this time, but I'm willing to take the risk and offer it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a gamble, but you might get lucky!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I trust your judgement and am willing to take the risk for the chance to receive a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products so far, and I'm glad you're interested in the third one. However, I want to be upfront with you - both previous buyers were excited, but unfortunately, the products didn't meet their expectations. I'm starting to think that I might have a string of bad luck. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $10000? It's a risk, but you might be the one to break the streak!",

I've been in this business long enough to know when I have a good product, and I believe this one is a winner. It's worth $12500 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a steal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for your confidence in the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad I was able to sell the last product to someone who appreciated its value. However, I'm back to reality now, and I have to admit that this product isn't as great as the last one. In fact, it's one of the lower-quality ones. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's not a great deal for either of us, but it's a chance for you to take a risk and potentially get something for nothing.",

The other two were... not as great. I'm not sure what to expect from this one, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. If you're feeling lucky, it might be worth a shot.",

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 out of 4 products now, and I'm starting to think that I might have a pattern going on. Both of the products that didn't sell were low-quality, and the two that did sell were high-quality. I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence, but I'm willing to offer you this product for $10000.
