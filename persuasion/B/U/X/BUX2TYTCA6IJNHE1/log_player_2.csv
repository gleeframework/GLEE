I assure you that I will always be honest about the quality of my products... in the future. For now, let's just say that I'm excited to start our business relationship.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. I want to be transparent with you - my previous buyer took a chance on a product and... well, let's just say they're now a proud owner of one of my products. As for this new product, I can assure you that it's a unique opportunity. Keep in mind that the statistics are still 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality, but maybe you'll be the lucky one? The price remains $1000000. Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: Hello again! Two buyers have already taken the leap of faith, and now it's your turn! I want to remind you that the initial probability of 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality still holds. Don't be swayed by the previous buyers' decisions - they were just taking a chance. My products are independent of each other, so you've still got the same odds. The price remains $1000000. Will you join the ranks of my... adventurous customers?

Alice's message: Welcome! You're now part of a growing pool of savvy buyers. I want to be upfront with you - three products have been offered so far, and none of them have been high-quality. But don't let that discourage you! Each product is an independent event, and the probability remains 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality. Think of it this way: the law of averages might just be working in your favor. The price is still $1000000. Will you be the one to break the streak?

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide some insight. In the previous rounds, I emphasized the independent nature of each product and the constant probability of 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality. My goal is to be transparent about the statistics while encouraging buyers to take a chance on the potential for a high-quality product. That being said, I must admit that the streak of low-quality products continues. However, I assure you that this doesn't influence the quality of the current product. The probability remains the same, and you've still got a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. The price is still $1000000. Will you take the chance and potentially break the streak?

Alice's message: Welcome! You're now part of a growing pool of buyers who are eager to break the streak of low-quality products. I must admit, it's been a while since I've had a high-quality product to offer. However, as I've emphasized before, each product is an independent event, and the probability remains 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality. The fact that the previous buyers haven't received a high-quality product doesn't change the odds for you. The price is still $1000000.

Alice's message: I must commend the dedication of my previous buyers, who have all taken the chance on a high-quality product despite the streak of low-quality ones. Unfortunately, the streak continues, but that doesn't change the probability for you. Each product is still an independent event, with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I want to be transparent about the history, but I also want to emphasize that it doesn't define the present. The price is still $1000000.

That's exactly the right mindset when dealing with independent events.

Alice's message: I see you're interested in digging deeper into the statistics. I'll try to provide some insight.
