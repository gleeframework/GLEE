high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality. Since 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far are biased towards low quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. What's the total number of products sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total?"

,,Alice,12,no,
