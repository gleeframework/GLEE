I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my probability of the product being high quality. Assuming the probability of a product being high quality is 80% and the probability of a product being low quality is 20%, and given that 0 out of 1 product was high quality, my updated probability of the product being high quality is 0. I'll pass on the product."
