,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality or the seller's sales record. I'm essentially taking a gamble."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and purchased the product, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, which means there's a 100% chance that the next product will be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the low sales record and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the quality of the product itself, but rather on the fact that the previous buyer bought it. I'd like to make my own decision based on the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous product sold to the first buyer before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product offered. The probability of this product being high quality is 50%, but the fact that the previous product was high quality suggests that the probability of this one being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer also bought based on your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation given the small sample size and the fact that I know you have an incentive to sell me a high-quality product. Can I see the previous buyer's purchase history?
