}"

This is a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.""
}"

}"

I'm confident that this is an offer you won't want to pass up.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the added value, but I'm still not willing to pay $9500 for a product worth $40000 to me. The complementary product may be worth $5000, but it's not enough to justify the price of the main product. I'll pass on this offer as well.

This is a compromise, and I'm willing to accept this price to ensure that you get the product you need.""

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in paying the same price for a product that I just paid $20000 for a high-quality one. I think you're trying to take advantage of me by offering a lower-quality product at the same price as a high-quality one. I'll pass on this one.
