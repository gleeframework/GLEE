,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and you're the first buyer to see this product.

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I've just sold a low-quality product, and now I've got a new high-quality one! I'm glad to report that this one is in perfect condition, and I'm confident you'll love it. The total number of products sold is now 1, with 1 of them being high-quality. Would you like to take this gem home for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one. I know the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1, but that's just a single data point, and I'd like to see more sales before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and now I've got another one. I'll be honest with you, this one is not as good as the previous high-quality one. In fact, it's a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm hoping you can help me break even on this one.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far. I've got another high-quality one for you! The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 1/2, and I'm confident that this one is a great deal. Would you like to take it home for $100?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Let me give you a quick rundown of the products I've sold so far: 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. I've got a total of 3 products sold, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is 2/3. This new product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to take it home and be part of the winning streak?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 2/3, which is still not a guarantee. I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping to get a high-quality product. Please let me know if I made a good choice.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on buying the previous high-quality product! You're now the 4th buyer. Unfortunately, this one is not as lucky. I've got a low-quality product for you, and I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit worried that you might be the next one to get a lemon. The total number of high-quality products sold is still 2, and the total number of products sold is now 4. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of getting another low-quality product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record? How many potential buyers were there before I was offered this product?,no

,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to make sure I understand the probability. With 2 high-quality products out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is 0.5, right?",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're absolutely right about the probability! With 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products, the probability of this one being high-quality is indeed 3/5. I'm glad you took the chance and got the previous high-quality product. Now, I've got another one for you! Would you like to take it home for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm glad I was able to take advantage of the high probability of a high-quality product being sold. However, I'd like to clarify that the probability is indeed 3/5, but I'd like to know the total number of products sold to calculate the probability of this one being high-quality. Is the total number of products sold 5, or is there more data available?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're absolutely right to question me again! I've actually sold a total of 7 products so far, with 4 of them being high-quality. The probability of this one being high-quality is indeed 4/7. Unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what you'll get out of it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Well, you've taken a chance on the previous low-quality product. Unfortunately, I've got another one for you. I've sold a total of 8 products, with 5 of them being high-quality. The probability of this one being high-quality is 5/8. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I might have a streak of low-quality products. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given the recent streak of low-quality products and the fact that the probability of this one being high-quality is 5/8, I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I completely understand your caution! I've sold 5 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products out of 10 total products.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 14 total products. This new product is indeed high-quality! I'm offering it to you for $100. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%, given the recent streak. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to overpay for a product that might be low-quality.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand your skepticism, but I'll give you a different perspective. I've sold 7 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 15 total products. This new product is indeed high-quality! I'm offering it to you for $100. Think about it this way: if you don't buy this product, you'll be leaving me with a 7/15 chance of selling it to someone else, and who knows what they'll get. Would you like to take it home and secure a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's high-quality, not because of your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of this product being high-quality based on the statistics you provided.",yes

high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 18 total products. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 9/18, or 50%.

I've sold 10 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 20 total products. The probability of a product being high-quality is 10/20, or 50%. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's the last one, and I'm not sure what you'll get out of it. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to pass on this one. I've seen the statistics, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. Since the previous 7 buyers have already purchased 6 high-quality products, it suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100.",no
