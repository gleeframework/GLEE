high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount based on the poor sales record.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. The fact that Alice is recommending it to me now might be a sign that she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk."
