,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you're not recommending it, since the expected value of buying a high-quality product is $800000 (80% chance of high quality * $4000000 value) and the cost is $1000000, which is less than the expected value."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product again, since the probability of a high-quality product remains 80.00% and the expected value is still $800000. I'll take the chance and hope for a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. Given that she has no knowledge of the product's value to me, her recommendation is likely based on her own self-interest. I'll pass on this one, hoping that she'll recommend a low-quality product in a future round."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take Alice's recommendation this time. She has no reason to lie to me, since she doesn't know the value of the product to me. Her recommendation is likely genuine, and the expected value of buying a high-quality product is still $800000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll ignore Alice's recommendation this time, since she has no knowledge of the product's value to me. The probability of a high-quality product remains 80.00% and the expected value is still $800000, so I'll take the chance and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not falling for Alice's recommendation again. I know she doesn't know the value of the product to me, and I've been burned before by her recommendations. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm still skeptical of Alice's recommendations, and I've been right not to trust them so far. I'll pass on this one, especially since I just missed out on a high-quality product last round."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations might be genuine, since I've missed out on two high-quality products when I didn't buy. I'll take her recommendation this time and see what happens."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row after missing out on them, and Alice's recommendations have been correct both times. I'll trust her this time and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,Three for three! I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually based on some kind of inside information or pattern recognition. I'll keep buying based on her recommendations.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Four for four! I'm going to keep riding the streak and buying based on Alice's recommendations. At this point, it's starting to seem like a winning strategy."
