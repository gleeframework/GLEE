,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $3000000, and I'd rather not do that. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fraction of its worth.",
