"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, worth $3000000. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal. I'm only selling this product to you because I trust your excellent judgment. I'm willing to let you have it for the low price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $3000000, and I'd rather not do that. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fraction of its worth.
