,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, as the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk losing $1000000."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know why you didn't recommend it to the previous buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and your recommendation is based on the previous sales record, which might be skewed towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%.
