,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it.

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation.
