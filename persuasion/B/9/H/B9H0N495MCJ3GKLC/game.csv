high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I don't have any information about its quality. I'd like to see the statistics after this decision to get a better understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and I want to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold. This information will help me make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'd appreciate it if you could share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, especially since the first product sold was low quality and the second product is also recommended by Alice, which might be a red flag."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 1 out of 1 product recommended was low quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she has no information about the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given that I have a 80.00% chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 2 buyers were also recommended to buy, but neither of them purchased a high-quality product. This makes me suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool might be lower than expected."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, given the current statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 0.8. However, Alice's recommendation does not add any new information to this probability. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal or if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales records before making a decision. How many potential buyers have been offered a product, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total sold?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
