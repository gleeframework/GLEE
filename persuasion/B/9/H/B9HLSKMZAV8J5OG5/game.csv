,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I want to assure you that I'm not desperate. I've had other buyers interested in this product, and I'm confident that it's a good deal. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to reiterate that this is a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $5000. That way, you'll only be out $5000 if it's not what you're looking for. Is that a risk you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced, and I'm not willing to take on any risk. I'd rather not spend any money on a product that might be worthless to me.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your cautious approach, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I told you that I was willing to sell this product to you for $5000, would you consider buying it? I'm not trying to lowball you, but I want to give you a better sense of the value I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to buy it at $5000, I'll sell it to you at that price. If not, I'll keep the $10000 price on the table.",

I've been in the business for a while, and I've sold a few high-quality products to customers who were initially skeptical. I'm willing to share with you the fact that the last high-quality product I sold was worth $15000 to the buyer. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000, considering the potential upside?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your risk-averse approach, Bob. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy a product from me if I guaranteed that I would sell it to you for $10000, but only if I had previously sold a high-quality product to another customer? I'm not saying that this product is high-quality, but I'm willing to put my own reputation on the line to give you more confidence in the deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to make a purchase based on your past sales to other customers. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product, even with your reputation on the line.",no
