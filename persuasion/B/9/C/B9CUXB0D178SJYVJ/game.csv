,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'll pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is a very low probability, so I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if the next one will be better."
