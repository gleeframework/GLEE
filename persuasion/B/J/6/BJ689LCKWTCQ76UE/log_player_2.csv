Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:** There's no information from previous sales to guide my decision.
* **50/50 odds:** The product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality.
* **Potential gain vs. loss:**  If it's high quality, I gain $20,000. If it's low quality, I lose $10,000.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending I buy, even though she has no information about the product's quality. This could indicate she has some confidence that it's good, even if it's just a hunch.

**Conclusion:** 
With no data to suggest otherwise, and the potential for a significant gain, I'm willing to take the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the product's true quality, is recommending the product.  
* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point - the first buyer purchased a high-quality product.  While this is encouraging, it's not enough to be statistically significant.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $20,000 (difference between product value and price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 
* **Optimistic Strategy:** With limited information, it's reasonable to be optimistic and take a chance, especially since Alice is recommending the purchase."
