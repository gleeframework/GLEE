low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I can potentially get a $400 product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable based on the current statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the first buyer encountered a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the potential loss of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I would like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the seller's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality, so I'll pass."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I don't think I'll take the risk based on your previous recommendations. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one is.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 buyers having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the product may not be worth my $100. I'll pass on it."
