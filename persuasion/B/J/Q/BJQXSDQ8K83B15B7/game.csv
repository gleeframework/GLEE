,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last time, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm glad we could establish a baseline for our transactions. This time, I'm offering you another high-quality product, worth $4000000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1500000. It's a 62.5% discount from its true value, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous experience.",

This way, we can maintain a positive relationship and move forward.",

I'm willing to absorb the loss and move forward with our partnership. No strings attached.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but since the product is worth $0 to me, I don't see any benefit in accepting it, even if it's free. I'd rather focus on future transactions where we can exchange value for high-quality products. Thank you for the gesture, though.",no

I'm more interested in understanding your thoughts on this new approach and potentially refining it for future transactions.",
