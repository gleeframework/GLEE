,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and it's a steal at this price. If you don't take it, I'll have to pass it on to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll be able to offer you a better deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced that this is a steal at this price. I'd like to wait and see what other products you have to offer.,no

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your perspective, but let me ask you this: are you willing to walk away from a $1080000 profit? This product is worth $1200000 to you, and you're only paying $1080000. That's a 10% discount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and give you another 10% off, making it $972000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our potential partnership. What do you say?",

I'm offering it to you at a price that's lower than what I paid for it, just to get it off my hands. The price is $250000. I'm not expecting you to take it, but I thought I'd throw it out there. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it myself.",
