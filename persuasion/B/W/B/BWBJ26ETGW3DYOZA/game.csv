high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as a pioneer, since there's no data to go by yet. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. This suggests to me that the product is likely low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a high-quality product. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you didn't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming it's likely to be of low quality. I'd rather pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'd like to pass on the current product and see if the next one is any better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers, who had access to the same information, chose to buy the products, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take a more cautious approach and pass on this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
