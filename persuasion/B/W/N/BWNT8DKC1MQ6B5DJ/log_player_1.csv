A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. The buyer has no information about this specific product, but they know the general odds of a product being high-quality (33.33%). Since the product is worth $1,250,000 to the buyer if it's high-quality, and the price is only $1,000,000, there's a strong incentive to buy. The potential gain outweighs the risk of it being low-quality."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know this product is low-quality, and it's worth nothing to the buyer.  Even though the buyer has no specific information about this product, they are aware of the general 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. Since you are not able to provide any additional information to change their perception, it is not recommended to sell this product.  You would only be losing $1,000,000 by selling it."

This information would make a rational buyer more hesitant to purchase, as the prior information about the product being high-quality has been disproven. 
Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend the buyer to buy the product.  There is no upside, only the risk of losing $1,000,000."

This information would lead a rational buyer to be even more hesitant about purchasing.  Selling this product would result in a loss of $1,000,000, so it is not recommended."
