**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (6/6). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy adds further confidence, as she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, it is highly likely the product is of high quality, making the decision to buy the product the optimal choice."
