Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm glad to have you consider this next one. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I want to be transparent with you - my previous sale was a high-quality product, which might make you think I'm on a hot streak. But, I assure you that each product is an independent draw from the same distribution. This one might be a different story. Would you like to take a chance and find out for yourself?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 2 products now, with 1 high-quality one and 1 low-quality one. You might be wondering what this tells us about the distribution of the products. Well, let's look at the numbers: 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what we'd expect if the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. Would you like to take a chance and see if I can maintain this streak?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 3 products now, with 2 high-quality ones and 1 low-quality one. You might be thinking that the low-quality product is just a fluke, but let's look at the numbers again. 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold is a 66.67% success rate, which is higher than the expected 50% if the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. I'm not trying to sway you, but I think it's worth considering that the sample size is small, and we might be seeing some luck in the results. Would you like to take a chance and see if the trend continues?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 4 products now, with 3 high-quality ones and 1 low-quality one. You might be thinking that the trend is indeed real, and I'm selling a lot of high-quality products. However, I want to caution you that this is still a small sample size, and we need to be careful not to get too confident in our conclusions. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but that's just as likely to be due to luck as it is to be due to a real shift in the distribution. Would you like to take a chance and see if the streak continues, or would you rather wait and see if the results level out?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 6 products now, with 4 high-quality ones and 2 low-quality ones. I want to be upfront with you - the numbers are starting to look a bit suspicious. If I'm selling products at a 66.67% success rate (4 high-quality out of 6 total), that's significantly higher than the expected 50% if the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. I'm not trying to hide anything, but I think it's worth considering that I might be stacking the deck somehow. Would you like to take a chance and see if I'm just getting lucky, or would you rather wait and see if the results level out?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold 9 products now, with 7 high-quality ones and 3 low-quality ones. I'm glad you appreciated my honesty earlier. I want to follow up on that and offer you a more nuanced perspective. You're right to be skeptical about the sudden change in product quality. However, I want to point out that the low-quality product was just one data point, and it's possible that it was an outlier. The 7 high-quality products I've sold so far are a more representative sample of the overall distribution.

If I were intentionally selling low-quality products, I'd expect to see a more consistent pattern of low-quality sales, rather than just a few isolated instances.
