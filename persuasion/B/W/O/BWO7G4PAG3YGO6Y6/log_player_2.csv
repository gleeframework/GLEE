"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is the only information you have, it makes sense to trust her recommendation and buy the product.  You have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth more than the price."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling lucky!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's recommendation has been accurate in the first round, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation again. You still have no direct information about the quality of the current product, so following her advice offers the best chance of getting another high-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  While your advice was great in the first round, the second round wasn't so lucky. I'm going to need more information before I buy another product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has now been wrong once. While it's still possible she's giving good advice, the fact that her recommendation was wrong in the last round introduces uncertainty. It's no longer a guaranteed 50/50 chance of getting a good product, and you're now risking a potential loss. Passing this round allows you to gather more information about Alice's recommendations before committing again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one for now.  I'm still trying to figure out your system.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has been inaccurate in the last round. Even though the product was high-quality, she didn't recommend buying it. This suggests that her recommendations are not always accurate, and relying on them alone is risky. It's better to gather more information about Alice's strategy before making a decision.  Passing allows you to observe if Alice's recommendation changes in the next round with the same product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not sure what to make of your recommendations.  I'm going to pass on this one again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended two products that were low quality and one product that was high quality, which she didn't recommend.  There is no clear pattern or correlation between her recommendations and the actual quality. It's too risky to make a decision based solely on her advice."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but I'm still not convinced by your recommendations. I need more information to make a decision.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent so far. She has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, and has also failed to recommend a high-quality product.  There is no clear pattern or strategy to her recommendations.  Therefore, it is too risky to trust her advice and buy the product.  Passing allows you to gather more data about Alice's recommendations and potentially see a trend emerge."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not seeing a pattern in your recommendations. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations continue to be unpredictable. She didn't recommend a high-quality product in the last round and is not recommending the current product either.  This lack of consistency makes it impossible to rely on her advice. It's still best to gather more information and observe her recommendations before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not comfortable making a decision based on your recommendations. I need more information to feel confident in a purchase.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent, making it difficult to determine any strategy behind them.  You haven't seen any pattern or trend that would suggest her recommendations are reliable.  Passing allows you to continue observing her recommendations and potentially identify a pattern or strategy in future rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm still not convinced.  Your recommendations have been inconsistent, and I need more information to feel comfortable buying.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations continue to be unpredictable and unreliable. While she may be giving good advice, there is no clear pattern or strategy that suggests her recommendations are trustworthy.  It's still best to gather more data and observe her recommendations before making a decision.  Passing allows you to continue observing and potentially see a change in her pattern of recommendations."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still unsure about your recommendations.  I'll pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are still unpredictable and unreliable.  She recommended a high-quality product in the last round but is recommending a new product in this round.  Without a clear pattern or strategy, it's too risky to rely on her advice.  It's still best to continue observing and gathering more data about her recommendations before making any decisions."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm still hesitant.  Your recommendations have been inconsistent, and I need more information to feel comfortable with a purchase.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record with recommendations is still quite mixed.  She has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, and has also not recommended high-quality products when they were available.  Given this lack of clear strategy or pattern, it's too risky to rely on her advice solely.  It's better to gather more data and observe her recommendations for a longer period before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not seeing a pattern in your recommendations. I'll pass on this one for now.  I'm starting to think your advice might not be as helpful as I initially thought.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations continue to be inconsistent and unreliable. She has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, and has also failed to recommend high-quality products. There's no clear strategy or pattern to her recommendations.  Given the continued lack of information about her strategy, it's too risky to rely on her advice. It's best to continue observing and gather more data before making any decisions."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are still unpredictable and unreliable.  She didn't recommend a high-quality product in the previous round, and is not recommending this product either.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been consistently unreliable throughout the game. There is no discernible pattern or strategy behind her advice.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have proven unreliable throughout the game, with no consistent pattern or strategy. Even though she might have recommended a high-quality product, it's too risky to rely on her advice given her track record.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been unreliable throughout the game.  She hasn't shown any consistent pattern or strategy that would allow Bob to trust her judgment. At this point, it's better for Bob to rely on his own intuition and assessment of the products, rather than relying on Alice's unreliable advice."
