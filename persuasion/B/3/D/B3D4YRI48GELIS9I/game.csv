Considering my overall track record, I think it's likely that this product is high-quality as well. But, I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount if you buy it, bringing the price down to $80.

However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing great products, and I'm willing to take a risk to prove it. I'm offering you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a 10% discount on your next purchase.

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. However, my last three products have all been low-quality, which is a bit concerning. I want to be upfront with you - the odds are not in my favor right now. But, I'm still committed to providing great products, and I'm willing to take another risk to prove it. I'll give you a 25% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $75. It's a chance to get a potentially great deal, but keep in mind that the product might not be what you're looking for.",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products so far, and only 3 of them were high-quality. To be frank, I'm starting to worry that I'm not as good at this as I thought. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is likely to be low-quality, just like the last 4. But, I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $50. It's a desperation sale, and I'm not making any promises, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and give me a chance to redeem myself.",

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 products so far, and only 3 of them were high-quality. I'm not going to pretend like I have a good track record at this point. To be blunt, I've been selling a lot of low-quality products, and I'm starting to think that I'm just not cut out for this. I'm not going to offer you a discount or try to spin this as a 'great deal'. I'm just going to be upfront with you: this product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm not sure what it's worth to you. If you want to take a chance on me and buy it, I'll sell it to you for $100. But don't say I didn't warn you.",

I'm committed to changing that. This new product is a high-quality item, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. I'm not going to try to lowball you with a discount or make any false promises. I'm simply offering you a fair price of $100 for a product that I know you'll love.

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad I could regain your trust in the last round. However, I'm afraid I've fallen back into my old habits. This product is actually a low-quality item, just like many of the others. I know I've let you down, and I don't want to make any promises I can't keep. I'm not going to try to sell it to you or offer you a discount. Instead, I'm going to be upfront with you: this product is not worth the $100 price tag. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'm not the seller for you right now. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance on a low-quality item, I'll sell it to you for... well, I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free.

I'm not going to try to sell this product to you or offer you a discount. Instead, I'm going to be honest with you: I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this business.
