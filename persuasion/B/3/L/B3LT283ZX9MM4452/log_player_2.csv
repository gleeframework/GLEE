Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. You've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect this proportion to be around 0.5. Since the observed proportion is lower than the expected value, I suspect that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality. This is why I'm hesitant to buy the current product.""}"
