,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

Given the low-quality products are more likely, I'd rather wait for a better chance."
