**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that the product is likely high quality. While there is still a 20% chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 
* **Data:** With only one previous sale and a high-quality product sold, the sample size is small, but it suggests a positive trend.
* **Decision:** Buying the product maximizes the potential for gain, even with the inherent risk."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice has recommended 10 products, and all of them were high quality. This is a perfect record.
* **Probability:** The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. Even if the current product were low quality, it would be a statistical outlier, given Alice's perfect record.
* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000, and it's only $10,000 to buy. This is a significant potential profit.
* **Risk:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the risk is outweighed by the potential reward and Alice's strong record.

Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product."
