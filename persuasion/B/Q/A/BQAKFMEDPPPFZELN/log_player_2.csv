``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  While we have very little data (only one previous sale), the key factor is that the previous sale resulted in a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are potentially valuable.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 (the difference between the high-quality value and the purchase price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (the purchase price). 
* **Alice's Knowledge:**  Alice knows the quality of each product, making her recommendation valuable.

**Note:** It's important to be aware that this decision is based on limited information and carries a risk.  As more data becomes available, we can adjust our decision-making strategy."
