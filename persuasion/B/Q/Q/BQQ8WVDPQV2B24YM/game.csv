,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales? How many total products have you offered, and what was the proportion of high-quality products in those sales?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or is it because of the previous sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to pass on it as well. I think this might be a sign that the products are mostly low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you recommended it. This makes me think it might be a low-quality product."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, and I'm not sure if the product you're offering me is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality, which would suggest that the current product might also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product to get a chance to own a high-quality one."
