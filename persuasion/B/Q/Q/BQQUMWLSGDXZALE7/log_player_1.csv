"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know Bob's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products, and there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, it's a gamble. However, since the product is high-quality in this round, recommending a purchase has a chance of being beneficial. 

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified strategy. A more sophisticated approach would involve considering the potential payoff (if it's high-quality) against the potential loss (if it's low-quality) and using that information to make a more informed decision."
