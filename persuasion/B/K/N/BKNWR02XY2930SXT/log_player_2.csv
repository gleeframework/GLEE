**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has sold 6 products, and all of them were high-quality. This suggests she's either incredibly lucky or has perfect information about the products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** She's recommending you buy the product, further strengthening the belief that it's likely high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, you lose $1,000,000. But if it's high quality, you gain $2,000,000. The potential gain outweighs the potential loss, especially with Alice's perfect track record.

**Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to buy the product.**"
