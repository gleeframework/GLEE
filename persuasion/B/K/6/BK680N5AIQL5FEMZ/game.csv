,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 2 previous buyers also bought and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I don't think I'll take the risk given Alice's recommendation and the statistics. It seems like the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality so I can see if your recommendations are accurate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying. Your past recommendations are not very encouraging, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure I should buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially given Alice's recommendation against it. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many low-quality products were sold? I want to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it? I've seen that 4 other buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, which makes me think that the product might be low quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. I'd like to make an informed decision, so please provide more context or information about the product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.
