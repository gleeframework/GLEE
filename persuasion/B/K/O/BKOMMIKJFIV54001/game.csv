high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,"2 out of 2 products sold so far are high-quality, which is 100% of the products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but so far, all products sold have been high-quality."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"2 out of 3 products sold so far are high-quality, which is 66.67% of the products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but it's worth noting that the observed frequency of high-quality products is higher than the true probability."

This might be a good opportunity to make a sale."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"4 out of 5 products sold so far are high-quality, which is 80% of the products sold.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, Alice! Given the low number of sales, I'm going to assume that the previous buyers were more likely to pass on low-quality products.
