Alice's message: Welcome to our store! This is a rare opportunity to own a unique product. With only 20 products available, and a limited number of high-quality products, the chances of getting a high-quality product are slim. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a steal! Don't miss out on this chance to own something special. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it?

Alice's message: Fair enough! Let me provide some context. We've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 out of 2 being high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is 50%. However, keep in mind that this is still a relatively small sample size, and the true probability of a high-quality product might be different.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right, 2 data points is a small sample size. But I'd like to offer a different perspective.

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the chance! Now, regarding your question, I can calculate the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you, given that the previous 2 buyers passed on the product. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% overall, and 2 out of 3 buyers passed on the product, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you is actually higher than 33.33%! It's around 40%! I'm still offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to own one of the remaining 16 products. What do you say? Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: I apologize for the estimate earlier! Based on the data, I can calculate the exact probability of the product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to explain the math behind my calculation! The probability of a high-quality product being sold is 4/8 = 50%, since 4 out of 8 products sold so far have been high-quality. However, since 3 out of 4 high-quality products have been passed on, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually the number of high-quality products remaining (1) divided by the total number of products remaining (5), which is 1/5 = 20%. Think of it like a deck of cards: the high-quality products are like the cards that have been passed on, and the low-quality products are like the cards that are left in the deck. The probability of drawing a high-quality card is now lower because there are fewer high-quality cards left in the deck. I'm still offering this product to you for $1000000.
