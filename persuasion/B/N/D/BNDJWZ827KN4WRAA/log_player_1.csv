I want to give you a clearer picture of the distribution: if I were to offer 10 products, I would expect 3.33 of them to be high-quality, based on the 33.33% probability. Since I've already sold 2 high-quality products, I'd expect 1 more high-quality product in the remaining 3 products.

I want to give you a thought: if I were trying to deceive you, I would have sold more high-quality products by now, given the probability of 33.33%. Since I haven't, it's possible that the remaining product is also low-quality. However, I'm still offering it to you for $1,000,000, and I'm willing to take the risk of being transparent about the odds. What do you say?""}"

Since the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, I'd like to choose the product that has the highest expected value. Given that I have no information about the quality of the two products, I'll choose the product that has the highest probability of being high-quality, which is 33.33%. However, since I'm being offered a discount for choosing the high-quality product, I'll choose the product that has the highest expected value, which is the product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a $500000 discount.
