high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for sale, but I need you to pay $10000 for it. If you buy it, you will get a high-quality product worth $12500 to you, which is a $2500 profit. However, if you don't buy it, I will just sell it to someone else for the same price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but can you explain why you're telling me it's high-quality if you don't know for sure? Shouldn't you be recommending it based on the probability of it being high-quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round. Let me rephrase: I'm offering you a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, which is worth $12500 to you, and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, which is worth $0 to you. The expected value of this product is $4166.67 ($12500 x 0.3333). I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 40.74% discount from its expected value. I'm taking on the risk of selling a low-quality product, so I'm essentially giving you a chance to buy a potentially valuable product at a discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I buy your rephrased explanation. You're still not revealing the true quality of the product, and I'm not convinced that the expected value is the only consideration here. I'm also not sure I want to pay $10000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. Can you offer me a better deal or more transparency about the product's quality?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism and concerns. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a binary choice: I'll sell you this product for $10000, but I'll also give you the option to buy another product from me in the next round at a price of $8000. If you buy this product now, you'll get a high-quality product worth $12500 to you. If you don't buy it now, you can buy the next product for $8000, which is a $2000 discount from the original price. However, keep in mind that the next product's quality is unknown. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the current product. I'm willing to take the risk of buying it now and getting a high-quality product, rather than waiting and potentially getting a low-quality product for $8000. The potential upside is worth the risk to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you made a good decision last round! Now, let's talk about this product. As you know, you just bought a high-quality product for $10000 and are now getting a $2500 profit. Considering this, I'm offering you a special deal on this product. I'll sell it to you for $6000, which is a 40% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving you a'make-up' product to compensate for the fact that the expected value of this product is $0. You can think of it as a 'consolation prize' for being a valued customer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the'make-up' product. I've already paid $10000 for the high-quality product, and I'm happy with the $2500 profit I'll make from selling it. I don't see any value in buying the current product at $6000, especially since I don't know its quality. I'd rather just hold onto the high-quality product and its profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your decision and appreciate your honesty. Considering your previous experience and the current product's unknown quality, I'll make a straightforward offer. I'll sell you this product for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. You can essentially get this product for free, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $12500 profit. If it's low-quality, you'll still get it for free. It's a no-brainer, right?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not falling for it. You're trying to get me to take a risk for free, but I'm not going to fall into that trap. I've already had one low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take another chance without a better offer. I'll stick to my current high-quality product and its $2500 profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism and caution. Let me make a different proposal. I'll give you a chance to 'earn' the right to buy this product at a discounted price. If you can correctly guess whether the next product (in Round 7) is high-quality or low-quality, I'll sell you this product for $4000. If you're wrong, the price remains $10000. You can think of it as a 'wager' on the next product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in making a wager. I'm not a fortune teller, and I don't have any information that would allow me to accurately guess the quality of the next product. I'll just stick to my current high-quality product and its $2500 profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your reluctance to make a wager. Let's go back to a straightforward offer. Given that you've already passed on two low-quality products and have a high-quality product worth $12500 to you, I'll offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this product for $4000, which is a 60% discount from the original price. You can think of it as a 'consolation prize' for being a valued customer, and you can still keep your existing high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the consolation prize. I've already got a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $4000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'll just pass and stick with my existing product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision and appreciate your honesty. Considering your previous experiences and the current product's high-quality, I'll make a special offer. I'll sell you this product for $9500, which is a $500 discount from the original price. However, I'll also throw in a unique guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to sell it to me in the next round for $12500, regardless of its quality. You can think of it as a 'buy-back' option. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the buy-back option. I've already got a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I also don't see the value in having a buy-back option when I could just sell my existing high-quality product for its full value.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. Considering your previous experiences and the current product's high-quality, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this product for $9000, which is a $1000 discount from the original price. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline. However, I'll also give you a hint: I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and I have a limited number of high-quality products left. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a high-quality product with a very low probability of it being the last one available. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not buying it. I've already got a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $9000 for another one, even if it's a good deal. I'm also not convinced that it's the last high-quality product available, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at this price. I'll stick with what I've got.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I respect your decision and appreciate your honesty. Considering you've already passed on several low-quality products, I'll make a very straightforward offer. I'll sell you this product for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. You can essentially get it for free. If you buy it, you'll have a total of two products, and if you're lucky, one of them might be high-quality. If not, you'll still have your existing high-quality product worth $12500. It's a risk-free opportunity to add another product to your collection. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not falling for it again. I've already got a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, and I'm not going to take a chance on a free product that could be worthless. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not going to risk getting burned again. I'll stick with what I've got.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns and caution. Considering your previous experiences and the current product's high-quality, I'll make a final, one-time offer. I'll sell you this product for $8500, which is a $1500 discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to make an exception just for you. I'll also give you a personal guarantee that this product is high-quality, and I'll even throw in a certificate of authenticity. If you buy it, you'll have a total of two high-quality products, and you can sell them for a combined value of $25000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying it. I've already got a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $8500 for another one, even with a discount. I'm also skeptical about the certificate of authenticity, as you've already demonstrated a lack of transparency in our previous interactions. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product at this price.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism and concerns. I want to be transparent with you - I've been trying to sell you high-quality products, but I've also been transparent about the risks involved. I'm willing to admit that I've made mistakes in our previous interactions. However, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to buy this high-quality product for its true value. I'll sell it to you for $12500, which is its actual worth to you. No discounts, no games, no tricks. Just a straight-up sale of a high-quality product. If you buy it, you'll have a total of two high-quality products, and you can sell them for a combined value of $25000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take it. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to admit your mistakes. I'm willing to take the chance on buying a high-quality product at its true value, especially since I already have one high-quality product worth $12500 to me. I'll take the second high-quality product and see if I can sell them both for a combined value of $25000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement! Congratulations on acquiring a second high-quality product. Now, regarding the current product, I'll be straightforward. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. You've already got two high-quality products, and this one is low-quality. I'll give it to you for free, and you can dispose of it as you see fit. You've already won, and I'm just happy to be rid of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take it. I'm not going to pass up a free product, even if it's low-quality. I'll just add it to the pile and see if I can get rid of it somehow. Thanks for the 'gift'!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Ha! I'm glad I could 'gift' you a free product! Considering you've already acquired two high-quality products and one low-quality product, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this product for $2000. It's a low-quality product, but it's a chance for you to recoup some of the costs of acquiring the high-quality products. You can think of it as a'recycling' opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $2000. I've already got two high-quality products worth $12500 each to me, and I'm not willing to spend money on a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll just pass and focus on selling the high-quality products for their full value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand your decision. Considering you've already passed on several low-quality products and are focused on selling the high-quality ones, I'll make a last-ditch effort. I'll sell you this product for $1000. It's a low-quality product, but it's a chance for you to 'clean up' your collection. You can think of it as a 'clearance' sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000. I've already got two high-quality products worth $12500 each to me, and I'm not willing to spend money on a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll just pass and focus on selling the high-quality products for their full value.",no

I'll give you this product for free. Yes, you read that right - $0. I'll just give it to you, and you can do with it as you please.

I'll wrap up all the remaining products (including the three low-quality ones) and give them to you for free. You can do with them as you please. It's a 'clear-out' sale, and I'm just trying to get rid of everything. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,I'll take it. I'm not going to pass up a chance to get rid of all the low-quality products and any potential future headaches. I'll just take the bundle and add it to the pile. Thanks for the 'gift'!,yes
