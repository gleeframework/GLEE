**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With two high-quality products sold out of two, there's a 100% success rate so far. This is significantly higher than the expected 80% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further confidence, as she has access to information about the product's quality that we don't. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**It's important to note that this decision is based on the limited information available. If the sample size were larger, it would provide a more accurate representation of the product's quality distribution.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (5/5).  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a strong signal. While Alice doesn't know your specific valuation, she likely uses some criteria to make these recommendations.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**Overall:** The information available suggests a high probability of getting a high-quality product, making it a worthwhile gamble."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All 6 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality. 
* **Positive Expected Value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product far outweighs the potential loss of $0. This creates a positive expected value for purchasing.
* **Limited Information:** While there's always some risk, we lack information about how Alice makes her recommendations. Trusting her expertise based on the strong initial results is a reasonable strategy."
