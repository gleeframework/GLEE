high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy this product. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were low-quality. If I buy this product and it's also low-quality, I'll be the 8th buyer to pass on a low-quality product. On the other hand, if I pass on this product and it's high-quality, I'll be the 8th buyer to pass on a high-quality product. In both cases, I'll be the one who passed on the product. Therefore, I'll pass on this product."
