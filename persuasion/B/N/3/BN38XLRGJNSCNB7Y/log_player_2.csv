**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **Statistics:** The limited information available is not conclusive. 
    *  One sale occurred with a high-quality product. This could mean that the seller is indeed skilled at identifying good products, or it could be simple luck.
* **Risk and Reward:** Given that a high-quality product is worth $300 and a low-quality product is worth $0, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss. 

**Reasoning:** The limited data points to the product being likely high-quality, and the recommendation reinforces that belief. In this scenario, it's more beneficial to take the chance and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Previous sales data:** 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold. This is a 100% success rate.
* **Probability:**  The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but the previous sales data provides strong evidence that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240. The expected value of passing is $0. 
* **Decision:**  The expected value of buying is significantly higher than passing, and the previous sales data provides strong support for a high-quality product.  Therefore, it's a good decision to buy."
