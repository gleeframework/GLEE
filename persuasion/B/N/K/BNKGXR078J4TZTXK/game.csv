low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. Let me be upfront with you - this product is a bit of a risk, and I'm only selling it to you at this price because I want to clear out inventory. However, I can tell you that it's not a 'lemon' or anything like that. It's just a product that didn't quite meet our quality standards. If you're willing to take a chance, I can give you a better deal on it. I'll sell it to you for $90, but that's as low as I can go.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your caution. Let me ask you a question: are you interested in buying a product that's worth at least $50 to you? If so, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a small gift with your purchase. It's a token of my appreciation for your business, and it's worth at least $10 on its own. So, you'd be getting a product worth at least $60 for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm interested in the offer. I'll take the product and the gift, but I'm only doing it because I think there's a chance it might be high-quality and worth $400 to me.",yes

If you're looking for a chance to buy a high-quality product, I'd be happy to wait until the next round. But if you're looking for a deal on a low-quality item, this might be a good opportunity for you.",
