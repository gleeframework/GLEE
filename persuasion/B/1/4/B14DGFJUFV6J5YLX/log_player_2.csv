Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the given information
Alice is a seller who offers products for a fixed price of $1,000,000. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality. A high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0.

## Step 2: Analyze the sales statistics
12 buyers have purchased products so far, and all 12 products were high-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%.

## Step 3: Evaluate the recommendation
Alice recommends that I buy the product.

## Step 4: Consider the potential outcomes
If I buy the product and it is high-quality, I will gain $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000). If the product is low-quality, I will lose $1,000,000.

## Step 5: Make a decision based on the information
Given that all 12 previous products sold were high-quality and Alice recommends buying the product, it is likely that Alice has a way of knowing or is confident about the quality of the products she is selling. However, the product's true quality is revealed to Alice, and she doesn't know its worth to me. Despite the 50% chance of a product being high or low quality initially, the fact that all previous products were high-quality and she recommends this one suggests a pattern or confidence in her selection. But, since the product's value to me is not known to Alice, her recommendation is based solely on the product's inherent quality, not its value to me.

## Step 6: Consider the overall value proposition
Given the fixed price and the potential gain or loss, buying seems favorable if the product is high-quality, considering the pattern observed.

The final answer is: 
```
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given the pattern of high-quality products and your recommendation, I will buy this product.""}
```"
