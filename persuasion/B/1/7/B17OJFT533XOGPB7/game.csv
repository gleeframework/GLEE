low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm going in blind, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there any specific reason you don't think it's worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your previous recommendations are reliable indicators of the product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, given the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality product. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk. If it's low-quality, I'll be wasting $1000000, but I'd like to see if I can get lucky."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm basing my decision on the statistics that 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than expected, and this product might be a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers who received a recommendation to buy have purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products and none were high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and avoid a potential loss of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 9 out of 9 previous buyers have also not found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (33.33%), and the fact that 9 out of 9 previous buyers have not found one, I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the statistics suggest."
