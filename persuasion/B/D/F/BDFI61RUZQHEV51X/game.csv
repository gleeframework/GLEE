,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product for now, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the current data?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no data to go by and the odds of a high-quality product are still 80%"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to observe more data before making a purchase. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. The fact that you recommended it might be a hint that it's a low-quality product, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, which is a very high proportion. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the remaining product might be low-quality as well. I'll pass on this opportunity."
