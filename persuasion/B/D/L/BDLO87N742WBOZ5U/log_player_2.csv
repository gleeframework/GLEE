Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure if I should pay $100 for it when I know its true value is $120. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your position, and I respect your decision to wait for a better deal. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective on this low-quality product. While it may not be worth $120, it's still a useful item that can be repurposed or sold for a small profit. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its potential value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that I can get at a discount, or a low-quality product that I can get for free.""}"

This way, you'll have a chance to take advantage of the discount or potentially get the product for nothing. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I understand the split-decision option. If I have a 50% chance of getting it for free, that means I'll only pay $80 half the time, but the other half of the time I'll still be paying $80 for a product worth $120. I'd rather wait for a better deal.""}"

Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one final offer on this high-quality product.
