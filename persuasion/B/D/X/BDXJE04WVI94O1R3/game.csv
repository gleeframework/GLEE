low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to start with a clean slate and get the first data point."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product and the recommendation."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I can save $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think there might be a high-quality product left"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products, and I don't want to risk wasting my $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and not worth the $100 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the fact that the previous products were low-quality, and she wants to sell this one to me. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from a buyer who has seen more high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy. I'd like to pass on this one.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 out of 6 products being low-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
