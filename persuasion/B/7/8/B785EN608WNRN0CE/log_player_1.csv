{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The buyer has no information to go on except the general probability of 33.33% that a product is high-quality.  This is not enough to justify the $1,000,000 risk, especially since a low-quality product is worthless. It's best to avoid recommending a purchase at this point."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there is no data yet on the quality of previous products, I will pass for now. I want to see how the quality of products sold to other buyers turns out before I commit to a purchase.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, I'm going to pass on this product.  Given the lack of prior sales data and your recommendation, I'm not comfortable with the risk.  I'll wait to see how future buyers fare before making a decision.
