,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall 33.33%.
