,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. I'm looking to sell this one for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a potentially discounted price, considering my low sales history.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the price and believe in the potential of this being a good opportunity given the lack of sales history.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm still looking to sell this one for $1000000. Keep in mind that my sales history is still very limited, and I'm not sure what to expect from this product. It's a risk, but it could pay off!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the limited sales history and the fact that both products sold so far were low-quality, I prefer to wait for more information before making a purchase. I appreciate your efforts and look forward to seeing more data on product quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far. I'm still looking to sell this one for $1000000. The fact that I've sold one high-quality product suggests that there's a chance this one could be good too, but I want to be upfront with you - the majority of my sales so far have been low-quality. It's a risk, but it could be worth it!",
,,the buyer,3,"I trust the statistics and your transparency. Given the risk, I believe the potential reward justifies purchasing this product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is slowly improving, which suggests that my sales history might be skewed towards low-quality products due to bad luck rather than a fundamental issue with my products. I'm still looking to sell this one for $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the limited data and the fact that two out of three products sold were high-quality, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is now 3:4, but the fact that this product is high-quality suggests that my sales history might be more representative than I initially thought. I'm still looking to sell this one for $1000000. I'm curious to see how you'll approach this decision.",

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. I want to acknowledge that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 4:5, which suggests that my sales history might be more representative of a mix of both. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to make an informed decision. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with the exact quality of the previous 5 products I sold, so you can see the distribution of high and low-quality products for yourself. I'm still looking to sell this one for $1000000.",

I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is now 5:7, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be higher than initially thought. Given the fact that this product is indeed high-quality, I'm wondering if you're willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a chance of being high-quality, or if you'd like to wait and see if the ratio continues to improve.",
