**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, indicating that Alice's recommendations are reliable for identifying high-quality items.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice recommends buying the product, it strengthens the belief that the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product, given the positive data and Alice's recommendation."
