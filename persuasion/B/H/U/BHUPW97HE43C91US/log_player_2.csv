With 4 out of 4 previous buyers being recommended to buy and none of them buying a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that all the previous products were low-quality.

Since I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'd rather wait for a product that has been rejected by a previous buyer, which would give me a higher chance of getting a high-quality product.""}"
