,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the product's quality is, but I'll take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality is still unknown and the recommendation from Alice is not sufficient to outweigh the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low probability of it being high quality and Alice's recommendation not being very informative given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think you're trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 out of 4 previous buyers being recommended to buy and none of them buying a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that all the previous products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the previous buyers were lucky and got low-quality products. Since I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'd rather wait for a product that has been rejected by a previous buyer, which would give me a higher chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, it's likely that all previous products were low-quality. I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000, which would be a loss of $30000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
