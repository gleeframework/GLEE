Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. I'm glad you're interested in this one! I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold a high-quality product before, and I'm not just trying to sell you a lemon. This one is just as good, if not better. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a small fraction of its true value. It's a risk-free investment, if you ask me.
