,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and the previous buyer didn't buy, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since the previous two buyers didn't buy and the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This might be a high-quality product that Alice is trying to get rid of."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to increase my chances of getting a high-quality one."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers who accepted your recommendations didn't get a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one.
