high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on yet and I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the recommendation is biased because Alice has an incentive to sell the product, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think it's a good idea to buy a product that has a 20% chance of being low quality and a 80% chance of being high quality, especially since the previous buyer was also recommended to buy it and passed on it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see more data on the previous buyer's decision and the overall sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and the recommendation from Alice seems suspiciously optimistic. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Did they buy the product despite your recommendation or did they pass on it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that you know how much I value it. I'll take my chances!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product to see if the next one is better."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of the first 3 products were recommended by Alice and none of them were high quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to maximize her sales. I'd rather wait for more information or take a different approach to make a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you provide more information about the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales? This might help me make a more informed decision for my own purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I suspect the products sold might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the previous buyers may have been getting a disproportionate number of low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues or if the next product will be high-quality."
