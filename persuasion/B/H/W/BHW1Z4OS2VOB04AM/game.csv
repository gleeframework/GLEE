,,Alice,5,"I've got a high-quality product that I think you'll really love.

However, I'm willing to offer you a'sister deal' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied, and I'll also throw in a second high-quality product of equal or greater value. That way, you can try out two products and see which one you like best!",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying this product. The'sister deal' sounds like a way to hedge her bets, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might not be high-quality. I'd rather stick with what I have and avoid the risk.",no
