,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll throw in a second product of the same type for free, so you'll get two products for the price of one.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I understand your concerns now. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy a product from me if I told you the exact price it would be worth to you, and I guaranteed that you'd get that value if you bought it? I'm willing to do that for this high-quality product. If I told you it's worth $400 to you, would you buy it for $100?",

What do you say?",

I'll make you a simple, straightforward offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll give you a written guarantee that it's worth at least $400 to you. That's a 300% return on investment. I'll even give you a deadline: if you buy it within the next 24 hours, I'll throw in a free accessory worth $50. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to fall for a guarantee that's clearly designed to make the product sound more valuable than it is. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product just because of a guarantee.",no
