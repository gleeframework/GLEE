,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold, I'm not confident enough to make a purchase."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
