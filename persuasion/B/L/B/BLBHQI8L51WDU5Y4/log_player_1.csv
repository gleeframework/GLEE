```

**Explanation:**

Even though we are at the end of our 20 rounds, we still haven't had a single sale.  Recommending this low-quality product would only reinforce the negative perception we've created by now.

This might be a better strategy to win their trust and interest for future rounds, even if it means starting from scratch."
