**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We have very little information to go on. There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. While she doesn't know the individual value to each buyer, she likely has some insight into the quality of the product based on her selection process.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) is significant. Even with the high probability of a low-quality product, the risk is limited (losing $100).

**Therefore, it makes sense to take a chance and purchase the product.**"
