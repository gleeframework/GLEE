,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't want to buy a product based solely on your recommendation, I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a purchase."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far.

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous buyer's purchase, or is there something else I should know?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to decline the offer based on the low probability of the product being high-quality and the fact that you recommended it, which might indicate a bias towards selling low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it? I've only seen one high-quality product out of one sale so far, so I'm not sure if that's representative of the overall quality of the products."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, and that product was high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 80.00%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
