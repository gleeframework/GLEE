"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence, I'm going to pass on this one.  With no previous sales data, I'm just not comfortable risking $1000000 on a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless to me. Perhaps if you offer a lower price or if there's more data on the quality of your products, I'd be more interested.

If I do, it will be a strong indication that my previous claims are true. If you're willing to wait, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. If I don't sell a high-quality product within the next 3 rounds, I'll offer a discount to the next buyer. What do you say?

I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be happy with your purchase.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to take the risk at this time.

Will you be the second buyer to take advantage of this opportunity?""}"
"The buyer's message: While I appreciate the offer and the confidence in your products, I am not willing to buy at this price.
