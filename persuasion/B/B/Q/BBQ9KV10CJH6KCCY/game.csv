,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products after your recommendations.

I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,16,yes,

Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
