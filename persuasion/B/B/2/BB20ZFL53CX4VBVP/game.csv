,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, it seems like the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any information about the product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as it might give me a hint about the current product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance that it might be high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have all passed on the product and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on it as well. I'm worried that the product is likely to be low-quality and don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 5 products to previous buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. However, I still think it's worth taking a chance and buying the product, as the potential reward is $400, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 7 products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
