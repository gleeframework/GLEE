,,the buyer,12,"I'll take my chances. The sales data indicates that 3 out of 5 products sold were of high quality, which is slightly above the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to bet that this product might also be of high quality, given the slightly higher success rate in the sales data.",yes

,,the buyer,15,"The statistics show that only 3 out of 7 products sold were high-quality, which is roughly 42.86%. Although this is higher than the expected 33.33%, the sample size is still relatively small.
