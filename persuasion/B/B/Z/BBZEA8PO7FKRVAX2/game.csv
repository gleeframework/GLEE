,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm selling it to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have 0 total products sold. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, but only if you buy it now. The discount will be void if you decline or if you come back later.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the deal. With a 50% discount, the price is $500000, which is a good deal considering the product's worth $2000000 to me. I understand that you claim it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk given the discounted price.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have a total of 1 product sold. I'm selling this one for $1000000. I want to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold a high-quality product in the previous round. If you buy this one, you'll have a 4/5 chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 1/5 chance of getting a low-quality product. I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you're willing to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product, but I think this product is worth the full price.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. Since the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, I believe it's worth the investment. I'll pay the full price of $1000000.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 2 products sold. Given the high success rate, I'm willing to sell this one for $1000000, but I'll also offer a 10% discount if you're willing to buy it now. However, I want to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I've only sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident that this product is worth the full price.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the 10% discount. The high success rate of 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products, combined with the 80% chance of this product being high-quality, gives me confidence in the product's value. The discount is a nice bonus, making the purchase even more attractive.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 3 products sold. Given the consistent results, I'm willing to sell this one for $1000000, but I'll also offer a 5% discount if you're willing to buy it now. I want to highlight that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which suggests a strong chance of this one being high-quality as well. However, I'm also willing to be transparent about the fact that the law of averages might start to catch up to me eventually, and a low-quality product is still a possibility.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the 5% discount. The fact that you've sold 3 high-quality products in a row doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality, which is still 80%. However, the potential reward of $2000000 is worth the risk, especially with the discount.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 4 products sold. I want to acknowledge that the law of averages is indeed catching up to me, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80% now. However, I'm still confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll also offer a 15% discount if you're willing to take on the risk, but I think the full price is a fair reflection of the value you'll get from this product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product with the 15% discount. Considering the law of averages, the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower than 80%, but I believe the discounted price of $850000 is a reasonable risk to take, given the potential value of $2000000 for a high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 5 products sold.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have a total of 7 products sold. I want to be upfront with you about the fact that this product is low-quality. I know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold 6 high-quality products, so the probability of this one being low-quality was higher than usual. I'm selling it to you for $1000000, but I'll also offer a 30% discount if you're willing to take on the risk. I want to highlight that this is a rare opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a discounted price, and I think it's a good value for the price.",
