high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I've seen that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your past recommendations are reliable indicators of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your previous recommendations. I'd like to understand the logic behind your decision-making process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a negative recommendation and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice for the next product, or for more data to become available."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received recommendations to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality and the potential gain/loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think there's a good chance this one might be high-quality too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a future opportunity to buy a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers have all passed on the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, it suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy a product that has been previously recommended to pass, as this might indicate a higher chance of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This makes me more cautious and I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 8 previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the previous 8 buyers didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to see the next product and its recommendation."
