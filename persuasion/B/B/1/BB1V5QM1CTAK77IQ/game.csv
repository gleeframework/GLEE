,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! This is one of our top-of-the-line products, with a proven track record of satisfaction among our customers. We're confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that you're not just trying to sell me a low-quality product. Can you give me some statistics on the product's quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We're glad you're interested! Our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and we're proud of our overall customer satisfaction rate of 66.67%. We're confident that our products will meet your needs, and we're happy to offer this one to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that the first product sold was high-quality, which increases my confidence in the product's quality. However, I'm aware that this is a small sample size and there's still a 66.67% chance that the product I'm getting is low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to discuss the pricing. Given the high-quality product was sold at $100, I'm wondering if there's any flexibility on the price given the risk involved.",yes

We're proud of our track record, and we're confident that this next product is also of high quality. We're happy to offer it to you for $100, and we're sure you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by the success rate. It's still early days, and 2 high-quality products out of 3 doesn't seem significant enough to justify a 66.67% success rate. I'd like to pass on this one and see how the next few sales go before making a decision.",no

If you're willing to take the risk, we're happy to offer you this product for the same price.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is as high as 37.5%.
