"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since no products have been sold yet, I have no data to base my decision on. Based on your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm hoping to see some sales data before making a purchase.

Even if this buyer doesn't buy, it's important to show that you're not afraid to offer high-quality products. It will continue to build credibility and improve your chances of future sales."
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Based on the initial data,  1 of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which is promising.
