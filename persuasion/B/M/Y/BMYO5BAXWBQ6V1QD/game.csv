high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and there's no prior information about its quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products and your lack of knowledge about the current product's quality, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). This suggests that the remaining products may have a higher chance of being low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
