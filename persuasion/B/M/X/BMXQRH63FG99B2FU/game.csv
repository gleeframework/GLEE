high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll also give you access to a detailed report about the product's features and specifications, which you won't get if you don't buy it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long this product will be available for sale.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk since it's a 50% chance of being high quality and you claim it is high quality, and I could potentially sell it for $12000",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've just sold a product to someone who thought it was a 50/50 shot, and they ended up making a profit. I'm not saying this is the case with this product, but I think it's worth noting that the previous buyer's decision was based on a similar probability. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll give you the same report as before.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. Since the product is high-quality and the previous buyer's decision was based on a similar probability, I'll buy it for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two high-quality products have been sold in a row. I'm not sure what this means, but I'm happy to provide you with this information. This product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but the fact that the last two products were high-quality might be worth considering.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. Given the information provided, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that the last two products were high-quality does not change the probability. However, I'll buy it since it's worth $12000 to me if it's high-quality and I can afford the potential loss.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've just sold three high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable coincidence. However, this product is actually low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality. I'm hoping you'll see the value in buying it anyway, even though it's not high-quality.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I will pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row, and the last one was rejected because it was low-quality. This product is actually high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but the fact that the last two products were high-quality might be worth considering.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. Given the 50% probability of a product being high-quality and your assurance that this one is high-quality, I'm willing to pay the $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold four high-quality products and one low-quality product. I'm not sure what this says about my sales, but I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I'll give you a special deal: I'll throw in a free inspection report, which might give you some insight into the product's quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the chance. Since 4 out of 4 products sold were high-quality and you're including a free inspection report, I'm willing to trust your recommendation and the probability of getting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Five high-quality products in a row, and you're still willing to take the chance? I'm impressed! This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to be upfront with you: the fact that I've sold five high-quality products in a row might actually be a sign that I'm not being entirely transparent about the quality of the products. I'm not saying that this one is definitely high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as before.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced that this product is truly high-quality. The fact that you've sold five high-quality products in a row is suspicious, and I'm worried that you might be hiding something. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold five high-quality products and two low-quality products. It seems like my sales record is a bit more mixed than I thought. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in buying it despite its quality.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but since it's a low-quality product, it's worth $0 to me. Paying $10000 for something with no value doesn't make sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold five high-quality products and three low-quality products. It seems like I've had a bit of a streak, but I'm not sure what that means. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in buying it at a discounted price.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your honesty about the product being low-quality. Given its worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to pay $5000 for it, even at a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold five high-quality products and four low-quality products. It's clear that I'm not perfect, and I'm willing to learn from my mistakes.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold five high-quality products and five low-quality products. It's clear that my sales record is a bit of a mixed bag. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just give it to you for free, and we can both move on with our lives.",
,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Since the product is low-quality and you're willing to give it away for free, I'll decline the offer as it's worth $0 to me.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Ah, my streak has finally come to an end. I've sold ten high-quality products and one low-quality product. I guess I'm not as infallible as I thought. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000. I know it's a steal compared to the usual price, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the deal.",
