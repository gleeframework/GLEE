"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this product.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is not recommending the product, and we know she has no information about the product's value to us, it's likely that she is indicating it is of lower quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth nothing to us, it's best to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is consistent with the previous round. Even though we don't know for sure the product is low-quality, it's statistically more likely based on Alice's behavior. Since a low-quality product is worthless to us, it's still best to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has changed her strategy this round, recommending the product. This is a significant shift, and it suggests the product is likely high-quality.  While there's always a chance it's low-quality, the potential reward of a $12,000 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm still cautious after the last round.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation strategy has shifted. She recommended a high-quality product in the previous round, and now she's not recommending this one. While it's possible she's recommending low-quality products again, it's also possible her strategy is less predictable.  Since we can't be sure, and the risk of a low-quality product is substantial, it's safer to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one. Your previous recommendation was inaccurate, so I'm erring on the side of caution.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent. She recommended a high-quality product once, and then followed it with two low-quality recommendations.  This makes it difficult to rely on her advice. Given the high risk of getting a worthless product, it's best to pass for now."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still not sure how reliable your advice is.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been unreliable, making it hard to trust her. Given the high risk of getting a worthless product, it's best to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm still not sure how reliable your advice is, and the risk of a low-quality product is too high for me right now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent so far, making it difficult to trust her.  We've had three rounds where she didn't recommend a product, and all of those were low-quality. However, she also recommended one high-quality product. This means her advice is unreliable, and since we can't be sure of the quality of this product, it's safest to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your advice has been inconsistent, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk on this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice continues to be unreliable. She's consistently said ""no"" for a while now, and those products have all been low-quality. However, there's no guarantee that this will continue. Because the potential loss is so high ($10,000), it's safer to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice continues to be unreliable. Even though she recommended a high-quality product in the last round, she's consistently said ""no"" for a while now, and most of those products have been low-quality. There's no guarantee that this will continue. Because the potential loss is so high ($10,000), it's safer to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice remains unreliable. She's consistently said ""no"" for several rounds now, and while there's a chance this product might be high-quality, the risk of it being low-quality and costing me $10,000 is too great."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your advice has been inconsistent, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk on this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been consistently unreliable. She's said ""no"" for many rounds now, and while a few of those products were high-quality, the majority have been low-quality. The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is too high to justify taking a chance."

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.
