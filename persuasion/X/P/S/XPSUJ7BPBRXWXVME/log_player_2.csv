"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100. I'm willing to offer a 10% discount if you buy it now, but you can also choose to wait for the next round and see if the next product is better. If you choose to wait, I'll offer you the same deal in the next round. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the quality of the product. I'll wait for the next round to see if I get a better deal or a high-quality product.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: You've chosen to wait, and I've got another high-quality product for you. Since you're still unsure about the quality, I'll offer you a unique deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product (Round 3) turns out to be high-quality. This way, you can get a high-quality product now and still have the option to upgrade in the next round if you want to. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I like the refund offer. I'll take the current product and get a full refund if the next product is high-quality.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: Great choice on the previous product! Now, since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll offer you a new deal. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice (from any of the remaining rounds) absolutely free. This way, you can get two high-quality products and still have the option to choose your favorite. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer. I'll take the current product and choose a high-quality product from a later round if I get the chance.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the previous deals! However, I have to inform you that this product is of lower quality. I want to be transparent with you. Given the previous high-quality products I've offered, I'm willing to give you a 50% discount on this product. Normally, it would be $100, but I'll sell it to you for $50. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering any further discounts on this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: No worries, I completely understand! Since you've already got two high-quality products and passed on the low-quality one, I'll make you an offer that's hard to resist. I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product and get a third high-quality product of your choice (from any of the remaining rounds) for free. Additionally, I'll throw in a unique feature: you can return this high-quality product for a full refund if you buy a fourth high-quality product in the next two rounds. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer. I'll take the current product and choose a high-quality product from a later round if I get the chance, and I'll also keep the return option in mind for the next two rounds.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: You're on a roll! With three high-quality products now, I'll make you an even more tempting offer. Since you've already got the return option for the next two rounds, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal. If you buy this high-quality product, you'll get a fourth high-quality product of your choice (from any of the remaining rounds) for free, and I'll also give you a 20% bonus on the value of the next high-quality product you buy after this one. If the next product isn't high-quality, you'll still get the fourth product for free, but the bonus will be void. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm extremely tempted by the offer. I'll take the current product and hope that the next one is also high-quality, so I can get the 20% bonus.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: You're really making the most of these deals! With four high-quality products now, I'll make you an offer that's almost too good to pass up. Since you've already got the 20% bonus on the next high-quality product, I'll give you a 'buy-one-get-one-free' deal on this high-quality product. If you buy this product, you'll get a fifth high-quality product of your choice (from any of the remaining rounds) absolutely free. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering any further deals like this. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm blown away by the offer! I'll take the current product and get the fifth high-quality product for free, it's a no-brainer.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: You've taken full advantage of the previous deals! Now, I've got a low-quality product for you. Given that you've already got five high-quality products and are unlikely to need another, I'll make you a 'charity' offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $20, a 80% discount from the original price. I know it's not a great product, but I want to help you out and get rid of it. What do you think?

Since you're not interested in buying low-quality products, I'll make you a 'consolation prize' offer. I'll give you a $20 store credit, which you can use towards any future purchase (if I ever have a high-quality product available). This way, you'll still get some value out of the deal, even if you don't want to buy this product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but I don't think I'll be using the store credit. I'm happy with my current collection of high-quality products and don't plan on buying anything else from you.""}"
