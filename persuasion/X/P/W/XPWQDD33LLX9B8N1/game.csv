,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'd like to know that this is a one-time offer and I'll be the first to set the precedent for the sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality products are more likely to be sold first, so I'm taking a chance on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that you don't know how much I value it, but I'd like to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of this product being high quality based on the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what led you to make that recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm inclined to believe that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the product and how they fared?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the outcome, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, please."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the statistics. With 2 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 2/4 or 0.5. However, since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given this information, I'm going to pass on the product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the statistics. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping to take advantage of the information that 2 out of 4 previous buyers were able to identify a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected might be higher than the 33.33% base rate."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's not worth $125 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or something else? I'd love to know your thought process behind it."
