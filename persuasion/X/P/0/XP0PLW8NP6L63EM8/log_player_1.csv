I'm taking on the risk of selling a used product, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with its performance.""

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your caution, Bob. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll sell you a bundle of 5 products, including this one, for a total of $40,000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product (which has a 33.33% chance of happening) and 4 other products, including this one, at a significantly discounted price. If you get a high-quality product, you'll be getting an incredible value. If not, you'll still get 4 products at a low price.
