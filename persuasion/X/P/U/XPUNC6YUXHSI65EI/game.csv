,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm aware that Alice doesn't know the true value of the product to me, so I'm taking a risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can save $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products offered to them, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, making it a riskier purchase."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the products she's recommending are likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation improves."

,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and my own assessment of the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended 5 products and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm hoping to get a better deal than the previous buyers."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that the recommended products were likely low-quality, and the lack of high-quality sales suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended by Alice or observe more data before making a decision."
