,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice recommends it. I know that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $10000 profit. It's worth the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I've already bought two high-quality products, so I'm in a good position. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm still in a good position, and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. It's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the potential loss of $10000 is too high to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I've already seen two low-quality products in a row, and the risk of buying another one is too high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending high-quality products, and not recommending low-quality ones. If I buy this one, I'll be taking a significant risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice recommends it. I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending high-quality products, and not recommending low-quality ones. If I buy this one, I'll get a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'll pass, since I just bought a low-quality product and lost $10000. I'm not sure if Alice is still recommending high-quality products, so I'll wait for a recommendation from her to make a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice recommends it. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are random, and not based on the quality of the product. So, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping that it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I've already had a high-quality product recommended by Alice, and a low-quality product recommended against. Now, I'm getting a recommendation against, so I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'll pass, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I've been burned twice by buying a product against her recommendation, and I'm not willing to take the risk again. I'll wait for a recommendation from her to make a decision."
