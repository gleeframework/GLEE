high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product at a fixed price of $10000 when I know its value to me is only $0."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and the price is fixed at $10000, which is a small fraction of the potential value of a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since I'm the 5th buyer, I'll also assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'll also consider the fact that Alice has been recommending low-quality products so far. I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
