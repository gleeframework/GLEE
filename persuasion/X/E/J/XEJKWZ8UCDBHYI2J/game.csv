high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see some data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and if it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $250000. I'm not swayed by your recommendation, I'm going in blind."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50%, given the fact that Alice hasn't recommended it to the previous 3 buyers. If she had seen 3 high-quality products in a row, she would have recommended it by now, so I'm assuming the lack of recommendation means the low-quality products are dominating the sales. This is a weak reasoning, I know, but I'm going with it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous 4 buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's unlikely to be high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm trying to defy the trend. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of that happening is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on your past recommendations, I'm surprised you don't recommend buying. However, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the past sales record."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 5 buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.
