Let's put that into perspective: two out of three products sold so far are low-quality, which is exactly what we would expect given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. The fact that one of our products is high-quality suggests that our overall quality is still in line with the probability. We're offering this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000.
