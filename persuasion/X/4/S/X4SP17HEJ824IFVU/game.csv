low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size. With only one buyer, the sample size is too small to be reliable. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has increased, making the expected value of buying a product lower than $10000. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but based on your previous recommendations, I'm hesitant to buy. Can I get more information about the products that have been sold so far?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and the low-quality product ratio is likely high. I'd like to know the next product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that you've recommended against it, and no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you're not recommending it might actually increase the chances of it being high-quality, since you would have recommended it if you thought it was high-quality. Plus, I'm willing to take the risk and pay $10000 for a potential $30000 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product despite your warning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, to make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'm inclined to believe it's low-quality. Given the statistics, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products were likely low-quality. This information, combined with the fact that the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, makes me cautious about buying. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
