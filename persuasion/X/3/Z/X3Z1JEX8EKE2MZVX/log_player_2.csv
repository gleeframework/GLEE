**Explanation:**

* **The Odds:** The information provided (2 high-quality products sold out of 2) suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products. While this is a small sample size, it's significantly better than the initial 80% chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds further weight to the decision. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $300 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, based on the available information, it's a good gamble to purchase the product."
