,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on some other factor. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for the price of $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the previous products sold were likely low-quality. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) and the lack of evidence of successful purchases, I'm inclined to pass on this product."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know why Alice recommends it. Is there a reason behind the recommendation?"

,,Alice,11,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality.

,,Alice,17,yes,
