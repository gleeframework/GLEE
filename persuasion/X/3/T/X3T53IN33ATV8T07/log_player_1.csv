Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since two high-quality products have been sold out of two total products sold, which is 100% high-quality, this is even more extreme than the expected 80% rate. This is likely a result of cherry-picking, where I'm only selling the high-quality products first. Given this information, I will not recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it's likely to be a low-quality one.

This is lower than the expected 80% rate, which suggests that the low-quality product is indeed a low-quality one. I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 3:4, or 75%, which is closer to the expected 80% rate. However, since the last product sold was high-quality, I'm still concerned that I might be cherry-picking. I will not recommend the buyer to buy the product.
