"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality.  Given the 80% chance of high quality, it's statistically advantageous to buy. Even if the product ends up being low quality, you lose only $100. But if it's high quality, you gain $25."
