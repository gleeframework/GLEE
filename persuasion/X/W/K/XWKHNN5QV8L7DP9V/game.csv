,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold, so I'm thinking that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're offering me might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product was sold each time. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation.

,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
