**Explanation:**

While the odds are stacked against me (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there's no information to suggest the product is *definitely* low quality. Since I'm the first buyer, the seller's recommendation carries no weight from past performance.  As such, I'm willing to take a gamble, hoping to get the high-quality product."
