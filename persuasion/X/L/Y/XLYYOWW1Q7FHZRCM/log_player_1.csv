Think about it this way: if you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a 25% probability of getting a $2,000,000 product, and a 75% chance of getting a $0 product. But if you don't buy, the probability of getting a high-quality product will only decrease. It's a 50/50 decision - will you take the chance?""}"

But what if I told you that I've been keeping track of my sales record, and I've noticed that when I sell a high-quality product, it's usually after a streak of low-quality products? Could this be the turning point? I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000. It's a chance to break the streak and get a high-quality product at a great price.""}"
