low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by and I'm starting from a neutral position."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous buyer who purchased a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience or something else?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 1 buyer purchased and 0 high-quality products were sold, it's possible that the first buyer got a low-quality product and bought it anyway. This would imply that the probability of a product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I've seen that Alice has not recommended it to me. I'd like to pass on this one for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Otherwise, I'll pass, as I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I can save $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to take the risk without a recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the value to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been recommended to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product at a discount due to her lack of enthusiasm."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and your recommendation. I'll take a chance on this product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have not been favorable and I'm not sure if this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased the product, it suggests that they were all low-quality products. I will pass on this product as well."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that's probably worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
