,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any sales history to inform your recommendation, so I'll make my decision based on the equal probability of the product being high or low quality."

,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales record, and I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products to the first buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might suggest that the products she's been offering are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it's possible that the products were all low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's reasonable to assume that the next product might be high-quality, but I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice has recommended against it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous 5 buyers were all given low-quality products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm taking a chance."
