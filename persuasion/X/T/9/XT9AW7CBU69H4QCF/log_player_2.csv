"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass on this product.""}
```

* Alice knows the product's value to you.  
* Since she's recommending it, it's more likely to be high-quality. Even though there's still a chance it's low-quality, the potential reward ($1,200,000) outweighs the risk (losing $1,000,000)."
