"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your selling history. You have just told them this product is high-quality, and they know the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.  Therefore, even though you could be lying, the expected value of the product for the buyer is still positive:

* **Expected value:** (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60

The product is worth $120 if it's high-quality, and $0 if it's low-quality, so the buyer would be better off buying it, hoping it's high-quality."
