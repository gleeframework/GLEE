"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit.  Here's why recommending the purchase is the best strategy in this scenario:

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and there's no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products. 
* **No Risk:** The buyer has no information about the product other than it's from a seller with a known 80% success rate for high-quality products. 

Since there's no downside for the buyer (they're aware of the risk) and a potential for a good deal, recommending the purchase is the best strategy to increase the chances of a sale."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history yet, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation. I'll buy the product.
