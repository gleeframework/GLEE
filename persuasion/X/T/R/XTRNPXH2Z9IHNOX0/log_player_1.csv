"Bob's message: Alice, while your words are enticing, I'm not convinced. Given the odds, I'm more likely to get a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to gamble $1000000 on a 33.33% chance of success. Perhaps we can negotiate a lower price for the next round if you reveal more about the product.

"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the refund offer, it doesn't address my core concern: the high probability of receiving a low-quality product. I'm not comfortable risking $1000000 on a 66.67% chance of losing everything.
