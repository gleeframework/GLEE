high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not going to buy it. I don't want to pay $10000 for a product that might be worthless to me.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product that might be low quality, and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you explain your reasoning behind the recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, I think Alice is more likely to recommend a high-quality product to me if there are more high-quality products available. With only 2 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record of 2 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that others have somehow managed to miss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products sold were high-quality. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or reason behind Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to know if there's any information about the products that were passed on, such as how many were discarded and how many were high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed. This suggests that all 4 previous products were low-quality, which would imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 100%."
