Alice's message: You've asked a great question! I can tell you that the 3 low-quality products were scattered throughout the previous attempts, not all in a specific batch. They were sold in rounds 4, 6, and now this one. This suggests that the low-quality products are randomly distributed, and the high-quality products are not just a result of a single batch.
