low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even without a recommendation from you. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, regardless of its quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I know that the previous buyer was recommended to buy, but since no high-quality product has been sold yet, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product might be high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather my own judgment based on the probability of the product being high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you concerned that the product is low quality?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or have a different recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the statistics so far. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I think you're trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. Can I see the sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products and I know that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy the product, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what is the probability that the current product is high quality given that you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can get a good deal on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. Is it significantly low?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like the products recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
