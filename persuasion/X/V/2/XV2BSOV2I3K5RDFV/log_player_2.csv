However, I'm willing to sell this next high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect the next product before you have to decide whether to buy it or not. This way, you can see if it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Wait, I thought you said you were out of high-quality products? You're now offering me another high-quality product? I'm confused. I'd like some clarification on what's going on. Also, the offer to inspect the next 5 products sounds suspiciously like a way to get me to buy something I might not want.
