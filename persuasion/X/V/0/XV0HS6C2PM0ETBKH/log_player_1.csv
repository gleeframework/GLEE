A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No prior sales information:** The buyer has no information about past sales. 
* **Known probability:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  The potential reward ($20,000) is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is even higher.  
* **Rational buyer:** A rational buyer would not risk $10,000 on a product with such a low chance of being valuable. 

Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend the product to the buyer."
