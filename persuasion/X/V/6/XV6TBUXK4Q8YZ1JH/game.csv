,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product has some unique features that might still be useful to you. It's not a top-of-the-line product, but it's still a good option for someone looking for a basic solution. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in a 'basic solution' for $100, especially when I know that a high-quality product is worth $120 to me. I'd rather wait for a better option.",no

,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer who knows a good deal when you see one! I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, but I want to highlight the benefits of buying this product now. If you wait, there's a chance I might not have this product available in the future.

I'm willing to sell this product to you today for $100, and I'm willing to give you a small discount of $10 if you buy it within the next 10 minutes. That brings the price down to $90.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll throw in a second product that's also worth $0. You'll essentially be getting two products for the price of one. What do you say?",
