,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the product. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm hoping to be the one to get the high-quality product."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation.
