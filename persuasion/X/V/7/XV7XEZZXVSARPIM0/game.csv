,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance on the first product! I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with value.

If you buy this second product, I'll give you a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll give you a third product of your choice (within reason, of course). This way, you can try out two products and see if you like them, and if not, you'll get a third one to make it right. What do you say?",

I've got a bunch of low-quality products coming in, and I'm not sure what's going on. But I want to assure you that I'm committed to making it right. If you're willing to stick with me, I'll give you a special deal on this product: I'll give you a 50% discount, so it's only $50. It's still not a great product, but it's a better value than usual.
