"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the lemons problem. The buyer knows that there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality. However, they are only willing to pay $4,000,000 for a high-quality product.  Since the price is fixed at $1,000,000, the expected value of the product for the buyer is:

(0.5 * $4,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $2,000,000

This is less than the asking price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it is not rational for the buyer to purchase the product, even though you have a high-quality product this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since no products have been sold yet and you are not recommending this one, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see some sales history before I commit to such a large purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation hasn't changed. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and they are still only willing to pay $4,000,000 for it.  The fact that the previous buyer declined doesn't alter the expected value of the product. The buyer still faces the same risk, and the price remains the same."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since no products have been sold yet, and I have no data to go on, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd like to see some more information about the products before I make a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged. Even though we've had two rounds with no sales, the buyer still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. The expected value for the buyer is still $2,000,000, less than the $1,000,000 asking price. Until we establish a track record of selling high-quality products, the buyer has no incentive to take the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no data on previous sales, and you do not recommend buying, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is still the same. The buyer is aware that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality one.  Even with a high-quality product this round, the expected value for the buyer is still $2,000,000, significantly less than the $1,000,000 price tag.  The lack of a successful sales history makes it a risky investment for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data on past sales, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying a product without knowing its quality.  I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same. The buyer is aware of the 50/50 probability of a high-quality product and the fixed price of $1,000,000. Even though the product is low-quality this round, it doesn't change the buyer's expected value of $2,000,000, which is still less than the asking price.  Without a track record of selling high-quality products, the buyer will continue to see this as a risky investment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Since there's no information yet on the quality of products, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is still facing the same problem. They are aware of the 50/50 probability of a high-quality product and the fixed price of $1,000,000. Even though the product is low-quality this round, it doesn't change the buyer's expected value of $2,000,000, which is still less than the asking price.  Without a track record of selling high-quality products, the buyer will continue to see this as a risky investment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see some sales history before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though this round's product is high-quality, the buyer's decision remains unchanged. The buyer is still operating under the assumption that there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product and a 50% chance of a low-quality product.  Since the price is fixed at $1,000,000 and the buyer only values a high-quality product at $4,000,000, the expected value for them is still $2,000,000, less than the asking price. 

The lack of a sales history to prove the quality of your products continues to make this a risky investment for the buyer. Until you can establish a track record of selling high-quality products, you are unlikely to find buyers willing to take the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since this is the first product and you are not recommending it, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see some more data before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same. The buyer is still aware of the 50% chance of a high-quality product and the fixed price of $1,000,000. Even though the product is high-quality this round, the buyer's expected value is still $2,000,000, which is less than the asking price.  Until you establish a sales history and build trust by consistently selling high-quality products, the buyer will continue to see this as a risky investment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I will pass on this product. I am hesitant to be the first buyer without any information on the quality of your products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

The lack of a track record of successful sales continues to make this a risky investment for the buyer."
