high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You are a rational buyer who values high-quality products at $100. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. If you don't buy it, I'll just sell it to someone else for the same price. You can't get a better deal anywhere else.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that the first buyer bought the product, and now you have some information. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100.

The choice is yours.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far out of 2 products sold. I'm not going to give you any special deals or discounts. The price is still $100. You can either buy it and take the chance it's high-quality, or you can walk away and wait for the next product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

You can either buy it and take the chance it's high-quality, or you can walk away and wait for the next product. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is working against me, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than you might think.",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping the law of large numbers will work in my favor and the next product will be high-quality.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 products sold in the last 2 rounds. The law of large numbers is indeed working in my favor. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll throw in a free bonus: I'll tell you the total number of products I've sold so far, and the number of high-quality products I've sold. This way, you can make an even more informed decision.",

I'll give you the same deal as before: I'll sell this product to you for $100, but I'll also give you a warning: the law of large numbers is starting to work against me. The probability of the next product being high-quality is actually decreasing. You might want to think twice before making a decision.",

,,the buyer,12,"I'm not convinced by your warning, Alice. With only 2 low-quality products possible out of the 11 sold, I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is still higher than 25%. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
