,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I know it's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first buyer was not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping that the low-quality products are being sold first, increasing the chance of a high-quality product being available for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process and what led you to advise against buying it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I don't think the previous buyers' decisions are representative of the true quality of the products yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the current statistics, it seems like the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm suspicious that the products being offered might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Based on the previous sales record, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's recommendation is against it, and I'm trying to infer the probability of high-quality products. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay $100, and if it's low-quality, I'll be out $100. I'm doing this to gather information for future purchases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a significant risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous 7 buyers were all very unlucky and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and 8 out of 8 previous buyers also chose not to buy, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far were low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and there have been 8 previous purchases with no high-quality products sold. This suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product, making it not worth the $100 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, but I'm also aware that this could be due to a lack of sales rather than a lack of high-quality products. I'd like to take on the risk and see if I'm lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not in my favor and I don't have any information that would make me think it's a high-quality product."
