Alice's message: You're our second customer, and I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to assure you that our products are carefully selected, but I also want to be transparent with you. Out of our first product, which was sold to the previous customer, I can tell you that it was indeed a high-quality one. However, I'd like to mention that our overall sales ratio is not as favorable as that one might suggest. In fact, I'd say the quality of our products is roughly 33.33% high-quality, which is publicly known information. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?
