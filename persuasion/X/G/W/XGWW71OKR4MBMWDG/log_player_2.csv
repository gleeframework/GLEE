Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the product's history. Unfortunately, I don't have much information to share about the manufacturing process or testing. However, I can offer you a unique opportunity to get a product at a fixed price of $10000. If you're not satisfied with the product, I can offer a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: if you buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $5000. That's the best I can offer, and it's a significant discount from the original price. If you're interested, you can buy it now.
