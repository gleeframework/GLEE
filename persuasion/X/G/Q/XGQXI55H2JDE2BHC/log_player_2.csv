Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. However, this product is actually a low-quality item. This suggests that the initial high-quality product was just a fluke, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50%.

Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products, and the last two products were both low-quality. This suggests that the initial high-quality product was indeed an outlier, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50%. However, I want to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and you're getting a chance to buy at the same price as the first buyer.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products, and both of the last two products were high-quality.

Out of those 2 purchased products, 1 was high-quality, and you said the last 2 products were high-quality.
