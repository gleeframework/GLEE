,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as all previous buyers who bought a product were recommended to do so, but none of the products sold were high-quality.

,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that there may be a higher proportion of low-quality products than expected.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against it. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it's possible that all products are low-quality, and I'd be foolish to pass on this opportunity."
