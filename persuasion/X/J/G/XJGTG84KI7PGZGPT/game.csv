low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50, considering the low price and the fact that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I'm suspicious that the remaining product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing given the poor sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and considering the previous 2 buyers also didn't buy with no high-quality products sold, I'm starting to think the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I could potentially get a $125 product for $100."
