**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There is very little data to go on. Only 2 previous buyers and 1 high-quality product sold.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While this is not a strong indicator, Alice's recommendation to buy does suggest she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant, even though the risk of a low-quality product is also high ($0). 

Since the data is limited, I'm leaning on Alice's recommendation and taking a calculated risk."
