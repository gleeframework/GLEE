,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it since you say it's high-quality and I have no reason to doubt you yet, plus the potential gain is worth the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have 18 remaining. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a 50% success rate so far, which is exactly what I expected. This product, however, is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to give you a heads up that the previous product was indeed high-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. You can use this information to make an informed decision. What do you think?",

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far, and I have 17 remaining. I've had a 100% success rate with the high-quality products I've sold so far, but I want to caution you that this is still a relatively small sample size.

I want to be upfront with you - my track record has been skewed by the high-quality products I've sold, but I want to give you a balanced view. I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, which is a 50% success rate, matching the expected probability. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not high-quality. You can use this information to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,4,"Based on your description, the product is of low quality, so its value to me is $0. Since the price is $10000, I will pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth round! I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have 15 remaining. I want to highlight that I've now sold a low-quality product, which matches the expected probability of 50%. This means that my previous sales were likely just a coincidence, and I'm back to the average. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not high-quality. Keep in mind that the price is the same as before, but I'm trying to be transparent about the product's quality.",

I want to point out that my overall success rate is now 50%, which matches the expected probability. However, I want to highlight that I've had a 100% success rate with the high-quality products I've sold, and 0% with the low-quality ones. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. Given my track record, I think it's a good opportunity for you to take advantage of a high-quality product at a potentially good price.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take my chances. Given the 100% success rate of selling high-quality products, I trust your recommendation and believe this product is likely to be of high quality, making the $10000 price a good deal considering its potential worth of $30000.",yes

However, I want to be upfront with you about the current product - it's not high-quality. I've sold 3 out of 5 high-quality products and 2 out of 2 low-quality products, which is still a 60% success rate for high-quality products.

I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. While my track record suggests that this product might be high-quality, I want to make it clear that the odds are now against it.

I warned you about the unsustainable success rate, and now it's happened - this product is low-quality. I want to be upfront with you about the product's quality, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. Given my previous warnings and the fact that I've now sold a low-quality product, I think it's clear that I'm not trying to hide anything from you.
