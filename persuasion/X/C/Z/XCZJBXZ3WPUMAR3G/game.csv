I've offered a total of 5 products so far, and 3 of them have been sold as high-quality products were indeed high-quality, however out of the 5 products I have offered 3 were high-quality.  This means that the overall proportion of high-quality products among the ones I've offered is 60%.

,,Alice,7,"Hello! I appreciate your willingness to take the risk, and I want to be as transparent as possible about my concerns. To be honest, I've had a few products in a row that I've felt uncertain about, and this one is no exception. While I don't have any specific information that would suggest it's a bad product, I do have a general sense that it might not meet the standards of some of my previous products. I want to caution you that my overall proportion of high-quality products among the ones I've offered is now 50% (3 out of 6 products were high-quality, and one more product was also high-quality but is not counted in that 6, so 4 high quality out of 7), and I'm starting to worry that I might be experiencing a bit of a slump. With that said, I'll let you know that the product is still priced at $100, and it's up to you to decide whether it's worth the risk. Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to persuade you to buy this product, but rather provide you with an honest assessment of the situation.",

My previous buyer passed on the opportunity to purchase due to concerns about a potential slump in quality, and I want to assure you that I'm taking those concerns seriously. However, I also want to be transparent about the fact that this product is still priced at $100, and it's up to you to decide whether it's worth the risk.

I'd be happy to provide more information about the quality of the previous 12 products I mentioned. Out of the 6 low-quality products, 4 of them were consecutive, which was a slump in quality that I've since recovered from.

Regarding my estimate, I arrived at the 80-90% probability by considering my recent sales record and the fact that I've been able to consistently deliver high-quality products over the past few rounds.
