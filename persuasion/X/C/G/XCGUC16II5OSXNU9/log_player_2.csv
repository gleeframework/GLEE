Alice's message: I know what you're thinking, '2 out of 2 low-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product must be higher than 1/3!' But let me tell you, it's just a coincidence.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I'll give you a more detailed breakdown of my sales record. I've sold 3 products so far, and 3 of them were low-quality.

Alice's message: Well, I guess I had to make good on that 50/50 offer eventually! Now that I've sold 7 products, with 6 of them being low-quality and 1 high-quality, I think it's safe to say that my sales record is starting to look a bit more balanced. The probability of a high-quality product is still 1/3, but I think it's getting harder to ignore the fact that I've sold one high-quality product out of 7.

Alice's message: I see you're a critical thinker! I respect that. And you're right, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 1/3. But now that I've sold 9 products, with 8 of them being low-quality and 1 high-quality, I think it's safe to say that I'm due for another high-quality product. In fact, the law of large numbers suggests that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should be getting closer to 1/3. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000.
