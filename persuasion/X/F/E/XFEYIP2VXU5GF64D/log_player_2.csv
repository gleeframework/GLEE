Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're happy with your decision. As for the history of the product, I can tell you that I have a rigorous quality control process in place, but I don't disclose the details of how I determine the quality of each product. As for the probability of a low-quality product, I'd say it's still around 50%, given that I have no reason to believe the current product is any different from the previous ones. However, I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $10000. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item at a discounted price.

However, I can tell you that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, for a total of 6 products. This suggests that my quality control process is working as intended, and the probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than 50%. The price remains at $10000.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. You are correct that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% at this point. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were to be consistently selling low-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see a higher proportion of low-quality products by now? I've sold 4 low-quality products out of 6 total products, which suggests that I'm not just randomly selling low-quality products. The price remains at $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to budge on the price of $10000. I've already sold two products at this price, and I'm confident that it's a fair value. I'd like to point out that you now have more information about my sales record than you did before, and you've seen that I've sold two products at this price. This should give you a better sense of the value of the product. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, but I'm not willing to lower the price.

Alice's message: You're asking the right questions! With 1 high-quality product out of 7 total products sold, the probability of a high-quality product is 1/7, or approximately 14.29%. I'd like to point out that this is lower than the initial 50% probability, which suggests that my sales record is actually slightly biased towards low-quality products. The price remains at $10000.

I'd like to point out that you're now seeing a pattern of low-quality products, but you're also seeing that I'm willing to continue selling at the same price.

I've been selling this product at $10000 for a while now, and I believe it's a fair price for the potential value it could bring. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at this price, and I'm confident that I can make a profit even if it's not high-quality. I'd like to point out that you're now seeing a third consecutive low-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is even lower than 14.29%.

Alice's message: You're applying Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a high-quality product! I'm impressed. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, and considering the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%.
