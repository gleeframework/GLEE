,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality based on the current data? And also, I'd like to know what your recommendation is based on?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80.00%.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. The fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know why you recommended it to me, considering the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly higher than 20%. Can you explain your reasoning?"

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
