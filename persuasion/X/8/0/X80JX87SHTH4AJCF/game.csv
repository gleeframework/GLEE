high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it's possible that all previous products were low-quality. If I buy the product, I'll be the third buyer, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, and the fact that 3 previous buyers have also purchased and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 3 buyers also bought the product despite your recommendation, I suspect that your recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that 4 buyers have purchased products without any high-quality ones being sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation is a reflection of the actual quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you're not recommending it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price of $10000 and the potential reward of $12500 if it's high-quality."
