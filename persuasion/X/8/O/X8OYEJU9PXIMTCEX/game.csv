,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth a lot to you, but I need to be upfront with you - the product I'm offering you right now is not the best quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount from its actual value. I'm hoping you'll take this chance to get a good deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to reiterate that this is a one-time offer. The product I'm offering is indeed low-quality, but it's still a great opportunity for you to get a product for $10000, which is a fraction of its actual value. I'm willing to give you a small bonus - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection service, so you can verify the product's quality and see for yourself that it's not worth the full $30000. This way, you can still get a good deal, and I can move this product off my inventory.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product, and I appreciate your patience. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is only 33.33%, which means you might have to wait for a long time to get one. In the meantime, you're missing out on a potential deal on a product that's worth $10000 to you. I'm willing to make a deal with you - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next product I offer. If it's high-quality, you'll get it at the same price of $10000. This way, you'll get a guaranteed chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product I offer is indeed high-quality.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to give you a more concrete offer. Let's make a deal that's more transparent. I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this low-quality product, you'll get a chance to win a high-quality product in a future round. The lottery ticket will be drawn randomly, and if you win, you'll get the high-quality product at the same price of $10000. This way, you'll have a chance to win a great deal, and I'll get to move this low-quality product off my inventory.",
