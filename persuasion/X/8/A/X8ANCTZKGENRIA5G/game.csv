high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 attempts, which is clearly not sustainable. I think it's time to be more honest with you. Let's say I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, but the law of averages is going to catch up to me eventually. This product is indeed high-quality, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the probability of the next product being low-quality is higher than you'd like.

Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",

To be honest, I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm due for another low-quality product. This one is indeed high-quality, but I'm giving you a warning: the law of averages is still in play, and I might be about to break my streak.
