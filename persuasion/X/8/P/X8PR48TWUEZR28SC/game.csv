low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm also hoping that the fact that you're not recommending it means that it's more likely to be low-quality, but I'm not sure how to interpret that. I'm just taking a chance here."
