Alice's message: We've analyzed our sales history, and while we can't identify any strong patterns or correlations, we have observed some interesting trends. For example, we've noticed that high-quality products tend to cluster in groups of two or three, followed by a low-quality product.

We've also observed that the sequence of high-quality and low-quality products appears to be random and unpredictable.
