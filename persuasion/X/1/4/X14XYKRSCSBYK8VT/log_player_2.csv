"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). Since Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation carries some weight. It's a calculated risk, but the odds are in our favor."
