,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're excited about the opportunity to influence the product's development, Bob! However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually a duplicate of a product you've already purchased from me.

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're excited about the negotiation challenge, Bob! However, I want to make it clear that this product is a premium offering that's worth the full $1 million. I'm willing to give you a 'negotiation bonus' - if you're able to negotiate the price down to $800000 or lower, I'll throw in a special bonus: a personalized coaching session with a negotiation expert to help you improve your skills. But if you're not able to negotiate the price down, the product is still worth the full $1 million to you.",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'beta tester' badge, just like before, and I'll also give you a $200000 credit towards a future purchase. This way, you can try out the product and provide feedback, and you'll also get a discount on a future purchase.",

But I'll throw in a special 'VIP access' package, which includes a private tour of my facility, a meet-and-greet with the product team, and a personalized thank-you note from me. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of our previous transactions.",

,,Alice,20,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance, Bob! This is the final product of the day, and it's a real showstopper. I'm willing to sell it to you at the full price of $1 million, but I'll throw in a special 'grand finale' package that includes a personalized thank-you note, a commemorative plaque, and a guaranteed spot in our VIP customer loyalty program. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a truly exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,Bob,20,"While the grand finale package sounds impressive, Alice, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. My experiences with the previous products have led me to prioritize quality over additional perks. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe it's important to make decisions based on the intrinsic value of the products themselves.",no
