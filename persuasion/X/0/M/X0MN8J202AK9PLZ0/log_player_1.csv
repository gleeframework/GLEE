"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $1,250,000 to the buyer, while the price is only $1,000,000, it is a profitable deal for the buyer. Even though they don't know the specific quality of this product, the 50% chance of it being high-quality is enough to justify the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no prior sales data, I'm willing to take a chance and trust your recommendation. I'll buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:**  This means it's a good deal for the buyer.
* **Buyer has limited information:** They only know the price and the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. However, they also know that a high-quality product is worth significantly more than the price. 
* **Previous sale:**  The buyer observed a successful sale in the previous round. This provides a slight positive signal, though it's still a small sample size.

Despite the limited information, the buyer still has a good chance of getting a high-quality product and making a profit. Therefore, it's still recommended to suggest the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  I'm willing to take a chance on this one given the positive sales record and your recommendation. 
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product quality:** The product is again high-quality, offering a potential profit for the buyer.
* **Sales record:** Two successful sales in a row strengthens the buyer's confidence in the seller's recommendations and suggests a higher probability of getting a good product.
* **Buyer's psychology:** The buyer has already experienced a positive outcome, making them more likely to trust the seller's recommendation in this round.

Even though the buyer still lacks complete information, the positive feedback from the previous rounds makes recommending the purchase a reasonable decision."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you've recommended a buy for the past two products, and both turned out to be high quality. I trust your judgment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product quality:** This time the product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose money if they buy it.
* **Sales record:** Although there have been three successful sales in a row, the buyer knows that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still only 50%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential loss from a low-quality product ($1,000,000) outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product ($250,000).

While the seller's track record is positive, it's not enough to overcome the risk of purchasing a low-quality product. It's important to be cautious and not rely solely on past successes, especially with a 50/50 chance of getting a bad product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since Alice does not recommend the product, and given the risk of buying a low-quality product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Product Quality:**  The product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose money if they purchase it.
* **Sales Record:** While the seller has a good record, it's important to remember that this is just a small sample size. One bad product can significantly impact the buyer's profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) outweighs the potential gain ($250,000) given the 50/50 chance of getting a good product. 

Even with the positive track record, recommending a purchase of a low-quality product would be irresponsible.  It's better to be cautious and prioritize the buyer's financial interests."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I understand you're not recommending the product, and given the 50/50 odds and the fact that it's worth nothing to me if it's low quality, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product quality:** The product is high-quality, presenting a potential profit for the buyer.
* **Sales record:**  While the seller has not recommended the previous two products, the buyer knows that the odds of a high-quality product are still 50%. The buyer is also aware of the previous successful sales, showing that the seller is not always wrong.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($250,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). The buyer may be willing to take a calculated risk given the recent sales record and the potential reward.

While the seller has not recommended the previous two products, the buyer has enough information to make an informed decision based on the overall statistics and the potential profit.  Therefore, it's still reasonable to recommend the purchase."

* **Sales Record:** The seller has a good record of recommending high-quality products, but this is just a small sample size.  The buyer needs to consider the probability of getting a low-quality product (which is still 50%).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss from a low-quality product ($1,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential gain from a high-quality product ($250,000).

It's not responsible to recommend purchasing this product, even with the seller's positive track record. The buyer should focus on the overall odds and prioritize their financial interests."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you don't recommend this product, and I'm still unsure of the quality, I'll pass for now.  I'll keep an eye on your sales history and maybe make a purchase later.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain ($250,000) from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000) from a low-quality product. 

Despite the seller's recent reluctance, the buyer has enough information to make an informed decision based on the overall statistics and the potential profit. Recommending the purchase is reasonable in this situation."

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential profit ($250,000) from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000) from a low-quality product.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss from a low-quality product ($1,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential gain from a high-quality product ($250,000).

Even with a strong record, the potential for loss is too great to recommend purchasing a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless. It's crucial to be cautious and prioritize the buyer's financial interests."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, and the previous sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. It's likely a low-quality product.
