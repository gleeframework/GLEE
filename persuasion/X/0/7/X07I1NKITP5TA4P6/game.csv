,,Alice,1,"This is the first round, and I'm offering you a deal of $1000000 for a product that could be worth up to $4000000 to you. I'm willing to take on all the risk, and if you're not satisfied, you can simply walk away with nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to take this risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already taken a chance on a low-quality product in the previous round and got nothing in return. This time, I'm offering you another opportunity to take a chance on a product that could be worth $4000000 to you. However, I'm not as confident about the quality of this product as I was about the previous one. In fact, I'm only 50% sure it's high-quality. If you're not feeling lucky, you can pass on this deal and wait for the next one.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Based on the uncertainty and the outcome of the previous round, I prefer to pass on this deal and wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious after the previous rounds. That's a smart move. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to give you a 'guarantee' that this product is high-quality. I'll give you a 100% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. But if it is high-quality, you'll get the full $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, Alice. Considering the potential value and the assurance provided, I am willing to take this opportunity and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've taken advantage of the guarantee twice already, and it's worked out well for you. However, I'm not going to offer the guarantee this time. Instead, I'll give you a piece of information that might help you make a more informed decision. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product in the past 3 rounds. The probability of this product being high-quality is now 60%. You can use this information to decide whether to take the risk or pass on this deal.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the historical data, Alice. Based on the increased probability of the product being high-quality (60%) compared to my previous experiences, I believe it's a good time to reassess and pass on this deal to explore other opportunities.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're being cautious, but I think I can do better than just sharing historical data. I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $200000 on top of the $1000000 you pay. However, if it's low-quality, you'll still only get the $0 value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the added incentive, Alice. Considering the potential upside, I am willing to take this bet and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've taken a risk and gotten a great reward in the previous round. However, this time, I'm not offering any additional incentives. Instead, I'll give you a simple statement: I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products in the past 6 rounds. The probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%. I'm not making any promises or bets this time. You know the numbers, and you know the risks. What do you do?",

,,Alice,7,"You've taken a risk and gotten burned twice in a row. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the numbers are not in your favor right now. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to turn things around. I'll give you a'reset' offer: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $1000000. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $4000000 value. It's a 50/50 shot, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. What do you do?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've taken a risk and gotten a reset, but it didn't quite work out. I'm not going to offer any more'reset' deals. Instead, I'll give you a more nuanced view of the situation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $200000 consolation prize. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $4000000 value.

Think about it this way: you've already seen that I'm willing to offer deals with potential upside.
