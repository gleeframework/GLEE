,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get a product that has a 33.33% chance of being worth $20000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a 50% discount from its potential value. It's a risk-free chance to potentially gain a lot, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",

This is a chance to double your potential gain, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the value of our relationship. What do you say? Will you take another chance and potentially double your return?",
