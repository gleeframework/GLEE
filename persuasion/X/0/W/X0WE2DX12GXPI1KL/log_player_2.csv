Alice's message: Hi! I'm excited to offer you a product for $100. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and I'm not sure which one is which. Since you're my first buyer, I'm a bit nervous about the quality, but I'm confident that it's worth the price. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

That means the probability of this new product being high-quality is 50%! I'm excited to offer it to you for the same price of $100.
