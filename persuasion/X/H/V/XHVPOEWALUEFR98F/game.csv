However, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and any relevant documentation. This will give you a better understanding of what you're getting, even if it's not a high-quality product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",

I'll give you the option to purchase this high-quality product at a price that's 10% above the market value, but I'll also throw in a premium service package that includes dedicated support, priority maintenance, and a 5-year warranty.
