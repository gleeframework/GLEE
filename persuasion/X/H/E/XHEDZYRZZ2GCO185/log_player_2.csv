Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. I understand your concerns from the previous buyer, and I'd like to assure you that my products are of the highest quality. As a matter of fact, I've just sold my first high-quality product, which means I've now sold a total of 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold. I'm confident that this product is worth every penny of the $10000. I'm willing to offer a 'no questions asked' return policy, but I must inform you that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not obligated to provide a refund if you change your mind after purchase.

However, I must inform you that the product I'm offering now is the 2nd product, and I'm not obligated to provide a refund if you change your mind after purchase. You're taking a calculated risk, but I assure you that this product is a great opportunity. What do you say?
