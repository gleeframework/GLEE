Alice's message: This is a premium product with a unique feature that will greatly benefit your business. It's a limited edition item, and I'm only offering it to you at a special price of $100. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you know the true quality of the product and I don't, and since the product's value to me is either $120 or $0, I'm not going to take the risk of buying it without knowing its quality. If it's high-quality, you would have offered it to me at a price higher than $100.""}"

The price remains the same at $100. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the personalized consultation is a nice bonus, I'm not convinced that a potentially low-quality product is worth the investment, even with the consultation.

I'm also willing to throw in a small bonus gift worth $10, which will help you get the most out of this product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even with the further discounted price of $60 and the bonus gift worth $10, I'm still not convinced that a lower-quality product is worth the investment. The total value of the offer is $70 ($60 product + $10 gift), but if the product is low-quality, it's worth $0 to me, and the gift is not enough to justify the purchase.
