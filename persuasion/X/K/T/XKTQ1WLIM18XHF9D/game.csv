,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm happy to provide some... let's call them 'testimonials' from satisfied customers who have purchased similar products from me in the past. I'm sure you'll be impressed by their glowing reviews. As for guarantees, I can offer you a... unique'satisfaction guarantee'. If you're not completely thrilled with the product, I'll give you a full refund... minus the cost of the product, of course. And as a special offer, I'll throw in a complimentary accessory that's worth $10000. The price remains the same, $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, your testimonials and 'satisfaction guarantee' are not convincing.  The guarantee is essentially meaningless, and I need more concrete evidence of the product's quality.  Testimonials can be easily manipulated.  I'm still not comfortable with the risk of losing $1000000 on a potentially low-quality product. I need something more substantial to change my mind.",no

However, I want to emphasize that this product is a 'limited edition' and 'exclusive' item. The details are proprietary, but I can assure you that it's a game-changer.

And as a reminder, the price is still $900000, but I'm willing to throw in the premium service package as before.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with the lack of transparency about the product.  'Black box' and 'proprietary' are not convincing arguments for me.

And as a reminder, the price is still $900000, but I'll throw in the premium service package as before.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the offer of a sneak peek, but I still need more concrete information about the product's features and benefits before making a decision. I understand you want to keep it confidential, but I'm hesitant to spend $900000 on something I don't fully understand.  I'm not interested in a 'sneak peek' if I don't have a clear understanding of the product itself.  Could you provide me with a more detailed description of what the product is and what it does?",no

It's a standard industry practice, and I'm willing to make an exception for you. The price remains the same, $1000000. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, while I appreciate your offer of a special report, I'm still hesitant to sign an NDA without knowing more about the product itself.
