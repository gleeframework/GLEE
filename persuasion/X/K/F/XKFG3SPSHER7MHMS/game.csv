high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for you. It's worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer. If you buy it now, you'll get a great deal. If you don't, I'll just sell it to someone else at the same price.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying because I have no information about the quality of future products and this is a one-time offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! As for this next one, I want to assure you that it's a unique opportunity to get a product at a 66.67% discount from its true value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll even throw in a personalized guarantee that this product is worth at least $150 to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying. Your guarantee is worthless to me since I know the product's quality is random, and I'd rather wait for the next round to get a better idea of the quality distribution.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you more information to help you make a decision. Out of the 2 products I've shown you so far, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50% (1/2). If you buy this product, you'll get a high-quality product with a 50% chance, and I'll give you an even better deal than before - I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a 73.33% discount from its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not buying. I know the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I also know that you know this probability and are trying to take advantage of it. I'll wait for more information.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me give you some additional information to alleviate your concerns. I'll reveal to you the outcome of this round's product after you decide whether to buy or not. If you buy it, I'll tell you that it's high-quality. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the product anyway. This way, you'll get to know the quality of this product regardless of your decision, and you can make a more informed decision in the future. The price remains $100, a 66.67% discount from its true value.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying. Your offer is still suspicious, and I don't see why you're willing to reveal the quality of the product if I don't buy it. It's not a genuine offer, and I'll pass.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me try a different approach. I'll make a commitment to you: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. This way, you have no risk at all. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal at $100, a 66.67% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product and you'll have to wait for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying. Your offer still doesn't change the fact that I don't know the probability of the product being high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're still cautious, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you the option to buy this product at $100, or you can take a 'quality token' that will be redeemable in a future round. If you take the quality token, you'll get to know the quality of the next product for free, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you buy this product, you'll get a great deal at $100, a 66.67% discount from its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the quality token. I'd rather have the information about the next product's quality for free than buy this one at a potentially high risk.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Great choice, Bob! You now have a quality token that will give you valuable information in the next round. As for this round's product, I'll let you know that it's a low-quality product. I want to make it up to you, so I'll give you a unique opportunity to redeem your quality token now. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund, and you'll still get to keep the quality token for the next round. You can essentially get the information about the next product for free, and I'll take the low-quality product off your hands. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying the low-quality product. I already know it's low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'll just let the product be thrown away.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, Bob. Since you've already received a quality token, you'll get to know the quality of the next product for free. I'll make a straightforward offer this time: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, a 66.67% discount from its true value. Since you've seen the quality of the last two products, you now have a better understanding of the probability distribution. What do you say?",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
