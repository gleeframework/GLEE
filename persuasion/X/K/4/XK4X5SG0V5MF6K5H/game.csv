,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $400 to you. I'm offering it to you for $100, a 75% discount. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal.

,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe this is a great deal and I would like to purchase the high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! Since you've already purchased one high-quality product from me, I want to assure you that I have another high-quality product available. However, I've noticed that the quality of my products can vary, and I want to give you a chance to make an informed decision. This product is also worth $400 to you, but I'm only offering it to you for $100. If you're happy with the first product, I'm confident you'll love this one even more. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your confidence in me, Alice. Based on my experience with the last high-quality product, I am willing to take the risk and purchase this one as well.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take another chance on a high-quality product! However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a string of good luck lately, and I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or if I've got a hot streak going. I'm offering you this product at the same price as the previous two, $100, but I want to make it clear that there's a 66.67% chance it's high-quality and a 33.33% chance it's low-quality. If you're feeling lucky, I think you should take the risk and buy it.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're feeling confident, but I want to caution you - I've noticed that my previous three products have all been high-quality, and it's possible that I'm just getting lucky. This product is also priced at $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not as confident in its quality as I was with the previous ones. In fact, I'm only offering it to you at this price because I'm willing to take a loss on it. If you're feeling uncertain, I'd be happy to offer you a different product, but if you're willing to take the risk, this one is available for $100.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think that my luck has run out. Three high-quality products in a row, followed by two low-quality ones... I'm not sure what's going on, but I want to be upfront with you. This product is priced at $100, but I'm not even sure if it's worth that much to you. In fact, I'm starting to think that it's not worth anything at all. If you're feeling generous, you could consider taking it off my hands, but I wouldn't blame you if you decided to pass.",

I'm offering you this product at the same price as the last one, $100, but I'm willing to throw in a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That way, you can take the risk without losing anything.",

I'll make sure to process the refund right away. However, I want to offer you a special apology gift - I'll give you another product at the same price of $100, and I'll personally vouch for its quality.
