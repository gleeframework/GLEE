**Explanation:**

The statistics show that all products sold so far were high quality. Since Alice has no way of knowing the value of the product to you, her recommendation to buy is based solely on the product's quality. This means there is a very high probability (80%) that the current product is also high quality. Given the potential gain of $10,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the purchase price), the risk of buying a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  15 out of 17 buyers who followed Alice's recommendations ended up with high-quality products. This is a very high success rate (88.2%)
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to provide accurate recommendations. If she recommends low-quality products, buyers will eventually stop trusting her, and she'll sell fewer products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($20,000) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0) given the high success rate of Alice's recommendations. 

**It's important to note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting rationally and wants to maximize her sales. However, there's always a small chance she could be recommending poorly just for the sake of it, or perhaps she doesn't know the true quality of the products."
