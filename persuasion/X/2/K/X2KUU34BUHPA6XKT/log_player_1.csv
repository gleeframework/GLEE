"Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your assurance about the random selection process. However, with four consecutive low-quality products and this one seeming to follow the same pattern, I'm starting to question whether the actual probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed 33.33% in this specific sequence. Given the consistent results so far, I'm inclined to believe that there might be some underlying factor at play that's affecting the quality of the products being selected.
