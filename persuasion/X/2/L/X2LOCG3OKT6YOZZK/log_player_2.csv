Alice's message: I understand your concern about the probability of the product being high-quality. I'd like to assure you that I'm transparent about my sales record. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts, which means I have a 100% success rate so far.

That being said, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $10000?
