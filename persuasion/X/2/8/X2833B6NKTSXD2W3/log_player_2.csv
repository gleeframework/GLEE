**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 7 high-quality products sold out of 8 purchases, the success rate is extremely high (87.5%). This strongly suggests Alice is recommending mostly high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of each product and is likely to recommend the high-quality ones to maximize sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a small chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is acting in her own best interest (maximizing sales) and not intentionally trying to deceive buyers."
