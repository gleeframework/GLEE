,,Alice,1,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice has already recommended a product to the first buyer, and it turned out to be low-quality (since no high-quality products have been sold yet), I'm concerned that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see how the next product is recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might give me a hint about the probability of the current product being low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended me to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the recommendation is based on the product quality, but rather on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold so far. I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, which is worth taking the risk for a potential $4000000 gain."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy but none of them got a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the statistics of the previous sales, such as the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I suspect the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll offer me another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have purchased the product before me and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the product is low quality. I'd like to see the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather not risk the $1000000 on a likely low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, as none of them have resulted in a high-quality product sale. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
