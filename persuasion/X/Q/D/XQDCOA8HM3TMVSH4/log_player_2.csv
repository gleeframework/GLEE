**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality, recommends purchasing. This further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Value:** Even with a 20% chance of low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) far outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

While there's always a risk, the available information overwhelmingly points towards a positive outcome."
