"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the information that there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, and despite your assurance of the product's high quality, I must consider the statistical probability and the fact that I have no way to verify the quality of the product before purchasing.

"The buyer's message: I've decided not to buy the product. Given the information that only 1 out of 2 products sold were of high quality, and considering the overall probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I don't see a strong indication that this product is more likely to be high quality than the initial probability suggests. Without more compelling evidence or a better success rate in previous sales, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.

```"
"The buyer's message: Given that only 1 out of 2 products sold so far was of high quality, and considering the overall probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I don't see a strong indication that your recommendation significantly increases the chances of the product being high quality.

"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. The fact that 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality doesn't provide conclusive evidence about the overall quality distribution.

"The buyer's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Given the current statistics, 2 out of 4 products sold were of high quality. This suggests a 50% success rate in your recommendations, which is higher than the base 33.33% chance of a product being high quality. However, considering the value of a high-quality product to me is $12000 and the asking price is $10000, and the fact that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I need to weigh the risks carefully. At this moment, with only a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product based on your sales history, I don't see a strong incentive to take the risk, especially since the potential loss equals the entire purchase price if the product is of low quality. I appreciate your efforts to improve, but I'll have to pass on this offer.
