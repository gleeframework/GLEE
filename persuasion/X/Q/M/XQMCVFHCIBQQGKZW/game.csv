high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality again."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm starting to think the product is high-quality most of the time, so I'll pass this time and see if I can get a low-quality product to avoid wasting money."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, since I've already seen two high-quality products in a row."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,Three high-quality products in a row is starting to look suspicious. I'll pass this time and see if I can catch a low-quality product.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is starting to make me think that Alice is just selling high-quality products, so I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Five high-quality products in a row is starting to look like a pattern. I'll pass this time and see if I can get a low-quality product to break the streak.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is starting to make me think that I should just assume all products are high-quality, so I'll buy this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is making me think that the probability of a product being high-quality is much higher than 80%, so I'll buy this one as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is making me think that I should just assume all products are high-quality from now on, and I'll just buy them all."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is making me think that I'm in a high-quality product hot streak, so I'll keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row is making me think that I should just keep buying, as the probability of a product being high-quality seems to be extremely high."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"A low-quality product finally shows up, which means I was wrong about the probability of a product being high-quality. I'll be more cautious from now on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"The low-quality product in round 12 was just an anomaly, and the high-quality product in round 13 was probably just a fluke. I'll assume the probability of a product being high-quality is still high and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Two low-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than I thought. I'll be more cautious and pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"One high-quality product and two low-quality products in the last three rounds makes me think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually around 50%, so I'll take a chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"Three low-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually around 20% or lower, so I'll take a chance and buy this one, but I'll be prepared to pass if it's low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"A high-quality product after a string of low-quality ones makes me think that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually around 80% again, so I'll buy this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've seen a mix of high-quality and low-quality products throughout the rounds, but the last two products were high-quality, so I'll assume the probability of a product being high-quality is still around 80% and buy this one."
