Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've sold many products so far, but I'll be transparent with you - I've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 so far, which is a 20% success rate. This means there's a 80% chance this product is low-quality. I'm taking a risk by offering it to you at this price, so I hope you'll take a chance on it!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm glad you're interested in this product. I've had a chance to sell a few more since our last conversation, and I'm happy to share the updated numbers with you. I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 10, which is a 20% success rate. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Think of it this way: if you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which could potentially be a great value. On the other hand, if you don't buy, you'll be missing out on a potential high-quality product. What do you think?
