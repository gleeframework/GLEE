,,Alice,2,"You now have a unique serial number that guarantees a 10% discount on the next high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $1000000, but I'll throw in a 'free' offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a second chance to buy the next high-quality product at the same 10% discount. If you don't buy this low-quality product, the 10% discount offer will expire, and you'll have to start over.",

This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a better deal than this.",

This high-quality product is available for $1000000, and as promised, you'll get a 10% discount on the next one. But here's the twist: if you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on the next high-quality product, on top of the 10% discount you already have. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a better deal than this.",

This low-quality product is still available for $1000000, but I'll give you a 'honesty' discount: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 5% refund on the purchase price. It's not the best deal, but it's a gesture of goodwill for being a valued customer.",

However, I'll make one more offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next two rounds, meaning you'll get to skip the next two products and go straight to the one after that.
