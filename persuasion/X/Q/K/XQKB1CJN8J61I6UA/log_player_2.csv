However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%.

Alice's message: I see you're thinking carefully about the probabilities. Let me put it this way: I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them have been either high-quality or low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I've already sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33% because I've already 'used up' one of my low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you this product for $1000000. What do you say? Will you take it home?

""decision"": ""yes"",
""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'm going to do some quick math first. Since you've already sold 2 products and 1 of them is high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually (1/1) / (2/2) = 2/2 = 1. This means the product is definitely high-quality, so I'll take it home for $3,000,000.""
