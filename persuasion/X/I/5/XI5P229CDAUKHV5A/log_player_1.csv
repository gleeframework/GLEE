Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, he would expect to buy a high-quality product in 16 out of 20 rounds (80% of 20). Given that he bought a high-quality product in the first round, this is not unexpected.
