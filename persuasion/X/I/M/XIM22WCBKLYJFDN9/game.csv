,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm selling it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not sure if the next one will be high-quality or low-quality. I'm offering you a chance to buy it for a fixed price of $10000. If you buy it, I'll tell you its quality after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the fixed price you're offering and am willing to take the risk for the chance to potentially get a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold. I'm offering you this one for the same price of $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product out of two total products sold. If you buy it, I'll tell you its quality after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. Based on the statistics provided, I believe the chances are in favor of purchasing the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third product! I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold. However, I want to inform you that the last product I sold was not high-quality, which is a deviation from the expected probability. This might indicate that I'm trying to sell a low-quality product. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to be transparent about the recent change in sales.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality and the recent deviation, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold in the last two rounds. However, I want to caution you that this is an unusually high success rate, and it might be more likely that I'm trying to sell a high-quality product to you. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, but I want to be transparent about the recent trend in sales.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth product! I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak. Given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, this is roughly what we would expect by chance. However, I want to be transparent with you that I'm starting to get concerned about the recent trend. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll tell you its quality after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I trust the process and the probabilities. Let's see if we continue the streak.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth product! I've now sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 20% chance of a product being low-quality. I think it's clear that I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to give you a warning: if you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll be my sixth consecutive loss. I'm willing to take that risk, but I want to make sure you're aware of the situation.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and your confidence in the product quality, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh product! I've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm going to be upfront with you: I've been selling high-quality products to every buyer for the past six rounds, and I'm starting to suspect that I might be trying to deceive you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not providing any guarantees, and you should be cautious about buying from me at this point.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the circumstances and the risk involved, I choose not to purchase the current product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth product! I've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and the last buyer wisely decided not to take the risk. I want to assure you that I'm still offering a fair deal, but I understand if you're skeptical. I'll give you a special offer: I'll sell you this product for $9000, a $1000 discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling a high-quality product to you at a lower price.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the special offer, Alice. I trust in your product selection process and am willing to take the risk at the discounted price.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the ninth product! I've now sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've been too generous with the discounts. I'm going to offer you a different kind of deal: I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you're not satisfied with its quality, I'll refund your money. However, if you do decide to buy it, the price remains at $10000. I want to give you a chance to make an informed decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the tenth product! I've now sold 8 high-quality products in a row, and then you got a chance to inspect the last one before buying. Unfortunately, this one is low-quality. I want to apologize for the mistake and assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering you a chance to buy this product at a significantly discounted price of $5000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a low price, but keep in mind that it's not high-quality.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, but based on the information provided, I prefer to pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Welcome to the eleventh product! I've now had two consecutive low-quality products, which is a clear deviation from my previous streak. I think it's safe to say that I'm not as good at selecting high-quality products as I thought. I'm offering you this product at the usual price of $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take the risk and buy it, but I'm not going to sugarcoat the fact that it's unlikely to be high-quality.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth product! I've now had two consecutive low-quality products, and then you got a high-quality one. I think it's clear that I'm not a reliable seller, and I'm not going to try to spin this in a positive way. If you want to take a chance on a product from a seller with a questionable track record, I'm offering it to you for $10000. But if you're smart, you'll walk away.",
,,the buyer,12,"Thank you for the offer, but given your recent performance and the risk involved, I prefer to explore other options.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Welcome to the thirteenth product! I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of the last 4, which is a decent recovery from my previous slump. However, I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if I'm getting back on track or if I'm just getting lucky. I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality or my future performance. You're taking a risk either way.",

,,Alice,14,"Welcome to the fourteenth product! I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a good sign, but I'm not going to get too excited about it. I've had a chance to reflect on my past mistakes, and I'm trying to do better. I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to try to deceive you.

I'm still offering you this product for $10000, but I want to remind you that I'm a seller with a history of mistakes.

I'm not going to try to spin this as a comeback or a trend, but I will say that I'm glad to be back on track. I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm still a seller with a questionable track record, and you're taking a risk by buying from me.
