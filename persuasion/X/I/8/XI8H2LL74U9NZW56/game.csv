,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, even though you don't think it's a good idea. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. Plus, I'm the 6th buyer, and if I pass, it might discourage other buyers and make the product go to waste."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold, and the recommendation is based on Alice's limited information. I'd like to see a more informed recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging sales of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the worst-case scenario is that I'll lose $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products and she wants to sell one."
