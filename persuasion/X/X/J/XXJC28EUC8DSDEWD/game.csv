,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the current product might also be low quality.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation given the low sales of high-quality products so far."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the 2/3 chance of a product being low-quality, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, and considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this one."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about your decision-making process and the reasoning behind not recommending this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one. Plus, I'm the third buyer and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which might be a fluke. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure I should take the risk, given the low success rate so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who bought the products?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation seems suspiciously optimistic given the statistics. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
