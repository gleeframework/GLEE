Well, I'll let you in on a secret: I've sold a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, but the ratio is not what you might expect. In fact, I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100?

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about the 'unique' low-quality products. What I meant was that they're not the kind of low-quality products that would be worth $100. They're more like... well, let's just say they're not worth much at all. In fact, I'm only selling them for $100 because I'm desperate to get rid of them. But this product, on the other hand, is a high-quality product. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the low-quality products I sold were indeed not worth much. I'll be honest with you, they were almost worthless. But that's not what matters right now. What matters is that this product is high-quality. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I'm willing to make a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund... but only if you're willing to buy it for $100. What do you say?
