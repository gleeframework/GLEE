"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk. This is a good opportunity to test the value of Alice's recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a strong signal. Since she's not recommending the product, it's more likely to be low quality. While there's still a chance it's high quality, the risk is too high compared to the previous round where the potential reward was known. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll trust your recommendation again. I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation track record is now 1 out of 2. Even though she was wrong in the last round, her overall success rate is still positive. The potential gain of $12,500 is a significant incentive, and Alice's recommendation gives some confidence that the product is likely high quality."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation track record is now 2 out of 3, but she's now recommending against buying. This pattern suggests she might have some insight into the quality of the products. While there's a chance it's a high-quality product, the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is too high based on her recommendation. It's better to play it safe and pass."
