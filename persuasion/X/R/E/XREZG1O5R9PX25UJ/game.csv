,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, which is a 0% success rate.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have also bought and none of them got a high-quality product.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation.
