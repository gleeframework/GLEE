,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a deal on a product for $10000. I know this product is not the best I have, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that I think is fair. If you buy this product, you'll get a good deal, but if you don't, I'll have to move on to the next product, which might be even better. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, I'd like to wait and see what the next one is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're being cautious, and I don't blame you. To be honest, this product isn't much better than the last one. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a hint: the next product is not the last one I have in stock. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a deal like this again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your hint, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm not surprised you're hesitant. Let me be more direct: I'm willing to sell this product to you for $5000. It's a significant discount from the original price of $10000. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only doing this because I want to get rid of it. If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on, and you might miss out on a good deal.",

,,Alice,4,"Ah, now this is a different story! This product is top-notch, and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. I'm not looking to negotiate, but I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount if you're willing to make a decision now. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! I'm glad you're happy with the product. Now, let's talk about this new product.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll! I'm glad you're confident in my products. This one is indeed high-quality, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I have a limited number of these in stock, and I'm not sure how many more I'll have available. If you buy this one, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund and replace it with a product of equal or greater value.

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not up to the same standards as the ones you've bought so far. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, and I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price. I'll sell it to you for $2000. It's a steal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer you a deal like this again. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that this product is a one-time opportunity. If you don't buy it, I'll have to move on, and you might miss out on a chance to get a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the best. I'll give you a second chance to reconsider: I'll sell it to you for $3000, and I'll even throw in a small gift, a complementary accessory that's worth $500. It's a deal that's hard to pass up, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer you a deal like this again.",

This product is still a product that can be used, and it's being offered to you at a price that's essentially zero. I'm not making any profit on this one, and I'm not even covering my costs. I'm giving it to you as a gesture of goodwill. If you don't take it, I'll have to dispose of it, and it will end up in the trash. What do you say?",
