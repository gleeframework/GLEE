high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the given 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I think the fact that the first two buyers also bought the product despite the low success rate of high-quality products in previous sales might indicate that the products being recommended are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a more neutral recommendation or more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first three products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. With 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that your recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality, so I don't want to risk buying it for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality.
