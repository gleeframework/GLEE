,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I know it's a 33.33% chance of being high quality, but I'm willing to take the risk since I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on."

,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers bought the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of a high-quality product being offered is likely low, and I don't want to risk wasting $100 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if the product is high-quality, you would have recommended it to me, and since you didn't, it's likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
