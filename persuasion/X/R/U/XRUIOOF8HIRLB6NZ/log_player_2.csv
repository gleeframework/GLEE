**Explanation:**

* **The statistics are favorable:**  4 out of 4 products sold have been high quality. This suggests a high probability of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This further increases the likelihood of a positive outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality (which has a lower probability based on the statistics), you only lose $10,000.  But if it's high quality, you gain $2,000. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
