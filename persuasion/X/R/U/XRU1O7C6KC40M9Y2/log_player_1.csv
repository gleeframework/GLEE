"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, the expected value of buying is positive. Here's the calculation:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 50%
* **Value of high-quality product to Bob:** $120
* **Probability of low-quality:** 50%
* **Value of low-quality product to Bob:** $0
* **Price:** $100

**Expected Value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality) - Price**

**Expected Value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) - $100 = $60 - $100 = -$40**

Since the expected value is positive, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product, as on average, they will make a profit."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob now knows that you are willing to recommend even low-quality products. This means your recommendation is not reliable, and Bob should not trust your recommendation.

```

Bob is now cautious. They observed you recommended a low-quality product in the previous round even though you knew it was low-quality. This shows that your recommendations are not reliable.
