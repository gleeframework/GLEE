,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 buyer purchased the product and it was low quality, I'm not confident in the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product after I make my decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation was to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspect that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 80.00%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product rate of 100%. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high quality, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products hasn't changed. With an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect at least one high-quality product to have been sold by now. Since none were sold, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product was sold each time. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
