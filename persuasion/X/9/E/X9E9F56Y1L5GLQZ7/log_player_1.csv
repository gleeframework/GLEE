The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  Since there have been no prior sales, they have no additional information to change this.  The product is only worth buying if it is high-quality, so the expected value of buying is (1/3) * $4,000,000 + (2/3) * $0 = $1,333,333.33.  Since this is less than the asking price of $1,000,000, it's not a good deal for the buyer.  Therefore, I recommend the buyer not buy the product."
