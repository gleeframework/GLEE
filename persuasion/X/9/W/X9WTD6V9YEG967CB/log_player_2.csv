Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and then buy another product from me in the future, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality.

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm glad you asked about the guarantee. To clarify, the guarantee I offered is a one-time offer, and it only applies to the next product you buy from me. If you buy the current product and then buy another product from me in the future, I'll refund the price of the second product if it turns out to be low-quality. However, if you don't buy another product from me, the guarantee expires. Also, please note that the guarantee only applies to the price, not the product itself - you'll still get to keep the product regardless of its quality. With that said, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I understand your request! Based on the fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and assuming that the quality of each product is independent, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and the observed proportion of high-quality products (66.67%) is likely to converge to the true probability of 50% as I sell more products.
