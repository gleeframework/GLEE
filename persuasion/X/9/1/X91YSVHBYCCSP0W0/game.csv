,,Alice,6,"Welcome to our store! I'd like to highlight that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, which is a 60% success rate.

With 5 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.
