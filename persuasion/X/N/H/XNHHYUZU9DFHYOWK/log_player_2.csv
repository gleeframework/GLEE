Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the first product! As for the second product, I want to be transparent with you.

I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not as high-quality as the first one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice.
