The price remains at $100, but you'll have the peace of mind that comes with a full refund if needed.""

This way, you'll get the product for $100, and if it's low-quality, you can use the gift card towards a better product in the future. It's a win-win!""
}"

If it's low-quality, you'll still get the $50, but you won't get the additional $50. You'll have a chance to win an extra $50, and the product will be yours for $100.""

You'll get two products for the price of one, and you can keep the high-quality one and sell or use the low-quality one as a gift. The price remains at $100.""
