,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's recommendation, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless item."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the information that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is because the product is low quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she might be trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality, which would mean there's a higher chance that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality. I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics. If 3 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying after her recommendation, it makes me skeptical."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure about the product, but I'm also not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product based on your past recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low sales of high-quality products so far, I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm a bit skeptical about the product's quality based on the previous sales record. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, I would like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that there's a high chance of the product being low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to pass on it.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have bought the products recommended by you, it seems like you're recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
