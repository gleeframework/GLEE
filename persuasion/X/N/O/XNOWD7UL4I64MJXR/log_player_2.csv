Alice's message: You're in luck! This is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind product. With only 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, the odds are in your favor. Plus, think of the prestige and exclusivity that comes with owning a product from a seller with a 50% success rate. Don't miss out on this chance to make a statement. The price is $1000000, a small price to pay for the potential of getting a high-quality product. What do you say? Will you take the risk and make this purchase?

Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! As you've seen, the first buyer took a chance and got a product. Now it's your turn! With the first buyer's success, you might be thinking that the odds are even more in your favor. But remember, the first buyer's purchase doesn't guarantee a high-quality product. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 50%. You're now aware that the first product was low-quality, which means the next one could be either high-quality or low-quality. The price remains the same at $1000000. Are you willing to take the risk and join the ranks of the first buyer, or do you want to wait for more information before making a decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyers for taking the risk and getting a product! Now it's your turn. As you've seen, the first two products had different outcomes. With this new information, you might be wondering if you should adjust your strategy. Let's put things into perspective: out of the two products sold so far, one is high-quality and one is low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product is now 2/3, since you've seen one high-quality product and one low-quality product. The price remains the same at $1000000. With this new information, do you think the risk is worth the potential reward? Will you take the chance and buy this product, or do you want to wait and see what the next product brings?

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth round! Congratulations to the previous buyers for making informed decisions and getting high-quality products. You're now aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 2/3. With this information, you might be thinking that the risk is even lower than before. However, remember that the probability is still not 100%. You could still get a low-quality product. The price remains the same at $1000000. But think about it this way: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll be joining the ranks of the previous buyers who got high-quality products. On the other hand, if you don't buy and the product is high-quality, you'll be missing out on a potential $1000000 value. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product, or do you want to wait and see what the next product brings?

Alice's message: You're in a streak! Three high-quality products in a row! As a potential buyer, you're now faced with a dilemma. On one hand, the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 2/3, which is a strong indication that the next product could also be high-quality. On the other hand, the law of averages might suggest that the next product could be low-quality, given that you've already seen three high-quality products in a row. The price remains the same at $1000000. You have to weigh the potential reward against the risk. Are you willing to take the chance and join the streak, or do you want to play it safe and wait for more information?

The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 2/3, but you might be wondering if this streak is sustainable.

Alice's message: Excellent question! The probability of a streak of 4 high-quality products in a row, given the underlying probability of 2/3 for each product, is actually quite low.
