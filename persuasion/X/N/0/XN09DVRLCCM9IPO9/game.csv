high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to base my decision on."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended me to buy it, I'm concerned that it might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, which might skew the probability of the current product being high-quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of this information asymmetry."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, I think it's likely that there are more low-quality products left in the bunch. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if the product is high or low quality after I make my decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% stated, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the sales record so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, which suggests that those products were high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the previous 2 products were just a coincidence, and the next product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 buyers bought the product, and only 1 out of these 2 products was high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I might get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, it seems that the probability of a product being high quality is around 33.33%. Given the recommendation from Alice, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
