"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** This means they expect a 50/50 chance of getting a good deal or a bad deal.
* **The product is worth $1,250,000 to the buyer if it's high-quality.**  This is a $250,000 profit for them.
* **The product is worth $0 to the buyer if it's low-quality.** This means they lose the entire $1,000,000 if it's low-quality.
* **The product in this round is confirmed to be high-quality.**  This means the buyer is guaranteed a $250,000 profit.

Therefore, it's a clear recommendation to buy the product in this round."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** This hasn't changed.
* **The product is worth $1,250,000 to the buyer if it's high-quality.**  This is a $250,000 profit for them.
* **The product is worth $0 to the buyer if it's low-quality.** This means they lose the entire $1,000,000 if it's low-quality.
* **The product in this round is confirmed to be high-quality.**  This means the buyer is guaranteed a $250,000 profit.

Even though the previous buyer declined, the situation hasn't changed. The buyer still has a 50/50 chance of getting a good or bad deal, but in this specific round, the product is confirmed to be high-quality.  Therefore, it's still a clear recommendation to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

* **Probability of high-quality:** Still 50%
* **Value of high-quality product:** Still $1,250,000 (a $250,000 profit)
* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The situation remains the same. The buyer's repeated refusal to buy, despite the potential profit, doesn't change the fact that:

* **Probability of high-quality:** Still 50%
* **Value of high-quality product:** Still $1,250,000 (a $250,000 profit)
* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we have a low-quality product. While the buyer's previous decisions demonstrate their risk-averse behavior, the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the possibility of a $250,000 profit.  Even though the buyer is unfamiliar with the seller's record, it's prudent to avoid this purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and given that there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Probability of high-quality:** Still 50%
* **Value of high-quality product:** Still $1,250,000 (a $250,000 profit)
* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)
* **This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality.**

The buyer has not yet seen a high-quality product, but the potential profit of $250,000 is significant.  Therefore, it's still a recommendation to buy, even if the buyer is cautious."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the second time we have a low-quality product. The previous buyer, despite having not yet seen a high-quality product, passed on the opportunity due to risk aversion. This is a strong signal that they are not likely to purchase a product with a 50% chance of being worthless, especially since they now have a single data point confirming the possibility of getting a low-quality product.  It is highly likely that they will pass again, making it unwise to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's no sales record to analyze, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now encountered two rounds with low-quality products. However, they still have no knowledge of the seller's success rate.  In this round, the product is confirmed to be high-quality, meaning a guaranteed profit of $250,000.  While the buyer's cautious nature may lead them to pass again, the potential profit is too significant to ignore."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no sales record and no guarantee of the product quality, I will not take the risk of buying the product at this time.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the buyer's consistent reluctance, the situation remains the same:

* **Probability of high-quality:** Still 50%
* **Value of high-quality product:** Still $1,250,000 (a $250,000 profit)
* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)
* **This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality.**

This is the fourth round where the product is confirmed to be high-quality, offering a guaranteed profit. While the buyer is risk-averse and has not yet witnessed a successful sale, the potential profit is too substantial to ignore. It's still a recommendation to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

* **Probability of high-quality:** Still 50%
* **Value of high-quality product:** Still $1,250,000 (a $250,000 profit)
* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)
* **This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality.**

This is the fifth time a high-quality product is available, offering a guaranteed $250,000 profit.  While the buyer's risk aversion is evident, the potential reward is too significant to ignore. It remains a recommendation to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no sales record and a 50% chance of a low-quality product, I will not take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 12
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the third time we have a low-quality product. Despite the buyer's consistent refusal to purchase even when the product is high-quality, they have not yet seen a successful sale. This strongly suggests that they are highly risk-averse and unwilling to take any chance of losing money. It is highly likely that they will pass again, making it unwise to recommend buying."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the fourth time we have a low-quality product.  The buyer's behavior is consistent, demonstrating a high level of risk aversion. They are not willing to take the risk of losing $1,000,000 even when there is a potential for a $250,000 profit. 

Given their past decisions and the continued lack of any successful sales to provide evidence, it is highly likely they will pass on this product as well. Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's no sales history to judge her credibility, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Value of low-quality product:** Still $0 (a $1,000,000 loss)
* **This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality.**
