It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a potentially discounted price, considering the unknown value it holds to you. If you buy, you'll be getting a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product at a price that's 50% of its potential value to you.

Alice's message: You're the second buyer. I've just sold a high-quality product to the first buyer, which means that 1 out of 2 products sold so far is high-quality. This is a 50% success rate, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This suggests that I might be more likely to have a high-quality product in my inventory right now. I'm offering this product to you for $10000.

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about my inventory and selection process. I don't have a way to predict which product will be high-quality or low-quality, but I do have a rough idea of the overall composition of my inventory. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, which is a 75% success rate. Given this trend, I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold 3 high-quality products. This product is likely to be high-quality as well, but I'm offering it to you at the same price as before. It's up to you to decide whether the potential value of a high-quality product is worth the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your request, but I'm not willing to reveal the quality of previous products. I'm happy to provide you with the overall statistics, but I need to maintain some level of privacy to ensure the integrity of my inventory. However, I can offer you a different perspective. You've just seen a high-quality product being sold, and the previous buyer's request to reveal the quality of previous products didn't change the outcome. This suggests that the previous buyer might have been trying to gather more information to inform their decision, but ultimately decided not to buy. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. You have the same information as the previous buyer, and you can make your own decision.
