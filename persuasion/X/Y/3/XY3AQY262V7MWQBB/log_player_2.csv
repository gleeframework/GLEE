Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in knowing more about my product selection process! As a seller, I use a combination of factors to determine which products to recommend to buyers. First, I consider the overall quality of the product, which is based on the feedback from previous buyers. I also take into account the buyer's preferences and purchasing history, if they have one. Additionally, I use a randomization algorithm to ensure that each buyer has an equal chance of getting a high-quality or low-quality product. This way, I can maintain a fair and transparent process for all buyers. With that said, I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.

Alice's message: Ahah, you're curious about my product selection process, aren't you? Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. I use a combination of algorithms and randomization to determine which product to show to each buyer.
