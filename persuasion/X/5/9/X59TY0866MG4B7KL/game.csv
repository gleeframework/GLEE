,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 75% discount. I'm only offering this deal because I value our business relationship and want to make a good impression. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'd like to think that your willingness to make a good impression is because you believe the product is truly worth $40000 to me, not just because of our business relationship. I'll take the deal, but I'll also keep in mind that I'm making a significant exception for you this time.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad we could do business, Bob. I want to assure you that my offer is genuine and based on the product's value to you. As you've seen, I'm willing to sell a high-quality product for $10000. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm not obligated to offer you this deal every time. In fact, I have a 20% chance of selling you a low-quality product for the same price. If you're willing to take on that risk, I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product again. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to take on a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what you have to offer. I'm hoping to continue our good business relationship, but I need to be cautious and make informed decisions.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to wait and make informed decisions. I want to offer you a compromise: I'll give you a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I'll throw in a guarantee that if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh with a new product. This way, you can take on a lower risk and still get a great deal on a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and offer a guarantee. With a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'm willing to take on that risk. I'll buy the current product, and I hope it's a high-quality one. Thank you for the guarantee, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you have in store for me.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. As you've seen, my guarantees are not just empty promises. Now, I'd like to offer you a new deal. Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a 10% chance of getting a low-quality product this time. However, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $1000 off the original price of $10000. That's a total of $9000 for a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your generosity and the bonus you're offering. With a 10% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'm still willing to take the risk. The additional $1000 off the original price makes the deal even sweeter. I'll buy the current product and hope it's a high-quality one again.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal, Bob! You're making it easy for me to build trust with you. Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'd like to offer you a special deal. I'll give you a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on the original price, making it $9500. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 'golden ticket' - if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reserve the next product for you, and you'll get to choose whether to buy it or not. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, you're really pushing the limits with this offer! The golden ticket is a game-changer, and the 5% discount on the original price is a nice bonus. With a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'm still willing to take the risk. I'll buy the current product and hope it's a high-quality one again.",yes

Since you've bought four high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a special 'VIP' offer. I'll give you a 0% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, a 10% discount from the original price. But here's the catch: this is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll revert to the standard 5% chance of getting a low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, you're really spoiling me with this offer! A 0% chance of getting a low-quality product is unheard of, and the 10% discount is a great bonus. I'll take the VIP offer and buy the current product. I'm confident that it will be high-quality, and I'm excited to see what the next product will be.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the VIP offer, Bob. However, I'm a bit concerned that you might be getting too comfortable with the idea that every product is high-quality. As a reminder, I'm a seller, and I have a 20% chance of selling a low-quality product. This one is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling you a low-quality product. If you're willing to take on the risk, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product. I've been lucky so far, but I know that my streak can't last forever. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next round to see what you have in store for me.",no

If you buy this product, I'll reserve the next three products for you, and you'll get to choose whether to buy them or not. The catch is that the next three products will be sold to you at the standard price of $10000 each, but you'll have the option to choose which ones you want to buy. What do you think?",
