high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the product's quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't have any information that would make me think it's a bad product. Her recommendation is neutral to me, and I'm taking a risk based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very informative given the current statistics. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will make a purchase, which might give me more information about the product's quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see the outcome and update the statistics. I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation, but rather on the fact that the previous two buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and the fact that you don't recommend it doesn't necessarily change my expected value calculation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you think it's high quality but not worth the price?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 products recommended to buy were low-quality. I'm skeptical of your recommendation, so I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be higher than 50% given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I know you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk.
