I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm eager to make a sale. The price is $10000, a steal for a product that could potentially be worth much more. What do you say? Will you take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 2 low-quality products. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to clear out some inventory. This product is a great opportunity to get a deal on something that's been taking up space. The price is still $10000, a steal for something that's essentially free to me. What do you say? Will you take it off my hands?

Alice's message: I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, and I'm starting to think I'm cursed. Seriously though, I'm just trying to clear out some space and make some room for new inventory. This product is still $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a 50% discount if you're willing to take the risk. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not making any promises about the quality, but it's a great deal if you're feeling lucky.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk, but only because of the 50% discount. I'm not convinced that your 'curse' is going to suddenly lift, but $5,000 is a price I'm willing to pay for the chance at a high-quality product. Don't expect me to start a trend, though - I'm only doing this because I think I can get a good deal.""}"

Alice's message: Well, congratulations on taking a chance and getting a great deal! I'm glad I could make a sale, even if it's not the kind I was hoping for. Now, back to the matter at hand... I've sold 3 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product, so far. I'm starting to think the odds are actually in your favor. This product is still $10000, and I'm not offering any discounts this time. What do you think? Will you take the plunge?

Alice's message: I've been waiting for a chance to redeem myself after the previous sales. I've sold 3 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product, so far. I'm confident that this product is the real deal. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product's quality. The price is still $10000, but I think it's a steal for a product worth $12500. What do you say? Will you take a chance on me?

Alice's message: I guess I still have some work to do to regain your trust. Let me put it this way: I've sold 4 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 20%... which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'm willing to admit that I've had a streak of bad luck, but I'm hoping that's just a coincidence. The price is still $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a free 'quality guarantee': if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice (which I'll reveal after you buy this one). What do you think? Will you take a chance on me?

The price is still $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a'buyer's insurance' - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 refund. What do you think?
