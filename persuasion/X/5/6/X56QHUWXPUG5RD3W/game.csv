,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, making it $90. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying at this price, I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the previous product. I'd like to offer you this next one for $100, but I'll be honest with you, I'm not as confident in its quality as I was with the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for a 'take it or leave it' price, but I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and we can part ways as friends. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying at the 'take it or leave it' price, and I'm not convinced by the guarantee. I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant. I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually quite similar to the one I offered last time, and I'm starting to think you might be a tough negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $80, but I need to know you're serious about buying something. If you're not interested, I'll have to assume you're not a serious buyer and move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in buying at $80. I'm still waiting to see the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see a pattern here. You're not interested in the low-quality products I've shown you so far. I'm starting to think you're looking for a high-quality product, and I have one in stock. I'll give you a chance to make an offer on this one. If you make an offer, I'll consider it, but if you don't, I'll assume you're not serious about buying a high-quality product and move on.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not making an offer, I'm waiting to see the product and the price. I'll consider buying it if it's a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're waiting to see the product and the price. I'll show it to you, but I want to make it clear that this is likely to be the last low-quality product I have in stock. I'll offer it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. If you buy it, you'll get a good deal, but if you don't, I'll have to get rid of it at a discount, and you might miss out on a good opportunity.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a free accessory. I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying anything I have left. I'll be honest with you, this product is probably the worst one I have, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to show it to you. I'll offer it to you for $60, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with a product that's unlikely to sell, and I'll have to eat the loss.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to wonder if I should just give up on trying to sell to you. This product is the last low-quality one I have, and I'm seriously considering just getting rid of it at a loss. I'll offer it to you for $40, but if you don't take it, I'm done trying to sell to you. I'll just put it in the clearance bin and move on.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $90. Plus, I'll include a premium service package that's worth $20. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.",

,,Alice,9,"Great, glad you liked the previous product! This next one is also a high-quality product, and I think you'll love it even more. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll make it even sweeter by throwing in a second premium service package, worth another $20. That way, you'll get a total of $40 in value on top of the product. What do you say?",

I'll offer it to you for $60, and I'll throw in a small discount on the premium service package, making it worth $15. It's not the best deal, but it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm running out of options here. This product is the last low-quality one I have, and I'm willing to give it away at this point.
