Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're considering purchasing from me. As you know, I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. Given this information, I'd like to highlight that this product is also high-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this streak and buy this high-quality product for $100? Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that my first product was high-quality might indicate a bias towards quality.

I'd like to assure you that my products are randomly selected, and the first product being high-quality was just a coincidence. In fact, this product is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great deal. Since you're not convinced by the first product, I'm willing to provide you with more information. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially benefit from a better deal?

Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! Given the sales record, the probability of a high-quality product being selected is indeed 1/3, or approximately 33.3%. However, I'd like to remind you that this is still based on a relatively small sample size. I've sold 3 products so far, and the probability of a high-quality product being selected might change as the sample size increases. That being said, this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and benefit from the quality?

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're interested in seeing how the probability of a high-quality product changes with more sales. As you know, I've now sold 4 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product being selected is now 2/4, or 50%.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! You're absolutely right to consider the probability of both high-quality and low-quality products. As you know, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 60%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 40%. I'd like to remind you that this product is actually low-quality.
