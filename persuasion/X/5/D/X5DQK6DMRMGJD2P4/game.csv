,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendation. I'm hoping to get a better idea of the product's quality by buying it myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers were successful. I'd like to know if you have any insight into why you're not recommending this one, and what the chances are of it being high quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous products were low quality since none of them were sold, and Alice recommends buying every time.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products you've seen so far in your sales record?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
