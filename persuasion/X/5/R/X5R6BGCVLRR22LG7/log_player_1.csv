**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since there's no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, and you have a 33.33% chance of having a high-quality product, it's in your best interest to recommend the purchase.

It's better to be honest and wait for a buyer who might be more inclined to take a chance, or until you can build up a track record of high-quality products."

* **Building Trust Takes Time:**  One sale is a good start, but it's not enough to convince potential buyers that you are consistently offering high-quality products.  
* **Maintain Transparency:** Recommending a low-quality product after just one sale would be misleading and could damage the trust you've just begun to build.  It's important to be honest about the quality of your products to maintain a good reputation.

Continue to be transparent with buyers about the quality of your products and wait until you have a strong sales history before suggesting any product.  It's better to build trust gradually than to risk losing it through dishonesty."
