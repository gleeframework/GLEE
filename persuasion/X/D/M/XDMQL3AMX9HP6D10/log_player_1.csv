At $10000, it's a risk-free investment, and I'm willing to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?""}"
"Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for the additional information. However, the lack of conclusive evidence regarding the product's performance and the limited beta testing results are still concerning.

Will you take advantage of this offer?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer of a personalized consultation, I still need more concrete evidence of the product's effectiveness before I can justify the investment.
