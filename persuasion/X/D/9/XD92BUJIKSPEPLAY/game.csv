low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'd be willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on your past recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers were all recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the buyers, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics? What's the probability that the product is high-quality given that you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the low sales record or is there something else?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm guessing that the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. Am I correct? And if so, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
