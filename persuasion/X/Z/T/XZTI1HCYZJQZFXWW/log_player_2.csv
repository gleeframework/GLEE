"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to you, it's a worthwhile gamble. Even if you end up with a low-quality product, you're only out $1,000,000. However, if you get a high-quality product, you make a profit of $3,000,000. It's a good risk/reward scenario."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information.  Since she's not recommending the product, it's likely she believes it's low quality.  Even though there's still a 50% chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high. If I buy it and it turns out to be low quality, I lose $1,000,000. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.  While there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product, her track record suggests she has valuable information.  Since the potential profit ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000), it's worth taking the risk."
