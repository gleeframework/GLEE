This is an impressive 75% success rate, which suggests that my products are extremely reliable. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of good luck so far, and I'm not sure if this next product will follow the same trend. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to caution you that the odds are not entirely in my favor. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier purchase than the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the detailed information about the product's history and the current odds.

This is an incredible 83.3% success rate, which is starting to look suspiciously good.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are not entirely in my favor this time. Would you like to take the risk and purchase this product?",
