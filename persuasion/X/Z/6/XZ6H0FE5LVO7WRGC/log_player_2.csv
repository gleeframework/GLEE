"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, which is a steal at half its true value. If you don't buy this product, you'll likely never find another deal like this.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. I'll wait for more information.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious. This product is still a great opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10000. Think of it as a chance to get a good deal on a product that might not be worth much, but could potentially be worth something to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. I'll pass again.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $500 credit towards a future purchase. That way, you'll essentially be getting the product for $9500, which is an even better deal than before.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the guarantee. The chance of it being high-quality is still low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product even at a discounted price.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to point out that you've already passed on two opportunities to buy a product at $10000. If you continue to wait, the price will not change, but the opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $10000 may not come up again. You're essentially paying $0 for the chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price, but you're not taking it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your argument. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I don't want to pay $10,000 for a 1 in 3 chance of getting a product worth $30,000.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. You're right that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'd like to point out that you've already had two opportunities to buy a low-quality product, which means you've essentially been given a free pass to wait for a high-quality product. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be missing out on a $20000 profit.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product. Your claim is just a guess, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be low-quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a compromise: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, so you can make a more informed decision. This way, you can see for yourself that it's a low-quality product, and decide whether it's worth the $10000 price tag. If you're still not interested, I'll be willing to let it go at this price, but I think you'll see that it's a good opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of its specifications and features. I'll pass on this opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in low-quality products, but I think you're missing out on a great opportunity. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on the price. I'll sell it to you for $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and even with the discount, I don't think it's a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $10,000 than buy a potentially low-quality product at a discounted price.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I'd like to point out that you've now had 7 opportunities to buy a high-quality product, and you've passed on all of them. Meanwhile, I'm still offering you a chance to buy a product at the original price of $10000. It's not a high-quality product, but it's a chance to get something for a fixed price, rather than waiting for a high-quality product that may never come up again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product than settle for something that's not worth much to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand you're holding out for a high-quality product, and I respect that. However, I want to make you a deal. I'll give you a chance to buy this low-quality product, and I'll throw in a unique feature: I'll give you the option to buy a second product of your choice from me at a discounted price of $8000. This way, you'll get two products for a total of $18000, which is a great value considering you're getting two products for the price of one. The first product is low-quality, but the second one could be high-quality, and you'll have the chance to get a good deal on it regardless.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the option to buy a second product at a discounted price. The second product could also be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting two products that aren't worth much to me.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make one final offer.

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it to me at any time in the next 5 rounds, and I'll give you a full refund. You'll essentially be getting a chance to try out a product at no risk, and if it doesn't work out, you can simply return it and walk away.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the option to return it. The risk of buying a product that's not worth much to me is still too high, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.""}"
