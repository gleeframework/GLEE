high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous buyers have been deterred by your recommendations, but I'd like to take a chance and purchase it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 8 buyers have received Alice's recommendations and none of them have purchased a high-quality product.

I'll pass on it to avoid the loss."
