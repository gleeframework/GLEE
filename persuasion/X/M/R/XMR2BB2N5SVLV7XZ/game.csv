,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% chance of being low-quality. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
