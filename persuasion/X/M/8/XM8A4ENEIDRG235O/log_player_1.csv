**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality.
* **High Value if High Quality:** A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to the buyer, significantly higher than the $10,000 asking price.
* **No Risk of Loss:**  Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the buyer loses nothing as the product is worth $0 to them. 

Therefore, the buyer has a strong incentive to purchase, as the potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss."
