I've had some... let's call them 'quality control issues' with this one. I'm not entirely confident in its performance, and I'm not sure it's worth the usual $20000. In fact, I'm not even sure it's worth $10000. But I'm willing to sell it to you for... $10000. Yes, the same price as the previous product.
