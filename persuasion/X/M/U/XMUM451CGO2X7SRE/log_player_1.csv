With that in mind, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to get two high-quality products in a row. What do you say?""}"

I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $900,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the exceptional quality and the fact that you're getting three high-quality products in a row.""}"

But don't worry, I'm confident that this one is just as good as the previous three. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $950,000. It's a slight premium, but I think it's worth it considering the exceptional quality and the fact that you're getting four high-quality products in a row.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. I believe the high-quality product is worth $4000000 to me, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not willing to overpay. I'm hoping you'll consider my offer and meet me in the middle.

What do you say?""}"

But, I'd like to point out that this is actually a bit lower than expected, given the probability of a high-quality product. This might indicate that we're due for a low-quality product soon. Still, I'm confident that this one is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the exceptional quality and the fact that you're getting six high-quality products in a row.""}"

However, I'd like to point out that we've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total sold, which is a 85.7% success rate. That's actually higher than the expected 80% probability of a high-quality product. This might indicate that we're actually on a hot streak! I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $950,000, and I think it's a great opportunity to ride the wave. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your analysis, Alice, but I'm still cautious about the high success rate. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase.

As for patterns or trends, I can tell you that all 3 low-quality products were sold in rounds where the buyer tried to negotiate the price.
