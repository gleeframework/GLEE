This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profits.  Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about the quality of my products.  Given a 50% chance the product is high-quality, recommending the purchase is the best strategy. Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the buyer has no basis to expect better in the future."

Since the buyer bought the product in the previous two rounds, they seem to be willing to take a risk.  Therefore, recommending the purchase offers a chance of selling the low-quality product, and if it turns out to be good, even better!"
