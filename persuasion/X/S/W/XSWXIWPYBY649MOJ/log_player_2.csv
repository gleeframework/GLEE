Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! I appreciate your diligence in seeking more information. I'd like to offer a more nuanced perspective.

Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more context on the probability calculation. We've sold a total of 5 products, and 4 of them have been high-quality.
