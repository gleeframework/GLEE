,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to get rid of it. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the pattern holds.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows the product's quality and is trying to manipulate my decision based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 4 out of 4 buyers have purchased the products and 1 out of 4 products were high quality, the proportion of high-quality products is 25%. This is lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I suspect that the low-quality products are being overrepresented in the sales record, so I'm going to pass on the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality is 25%. However, considering the fact that Alice is recommending it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product, so I'll pass on it to avoid the potential loss."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, and Alice recommends buying the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
