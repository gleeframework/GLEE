,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation to the first buyer.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, since 2 out of 2 recommended products have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation changes as more buyers are involved."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also received a 'no recommendation' from you and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a more favorable recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the fact that you recommended it might be a hint that it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, she hasn't sold any high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 80.00%.
