,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but I don't have any information to go on yet. I'd like to see the outcome of the product's quality before deciding whether to buy or pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information about the quality of the products. I'll wait for some sales data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, but I'll just go ahead and buy it"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous buyer's decision is likely influenced by the product being low quality, so I'm trying to exploit this information. If I'm wrong, I'll be out $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it's likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics so far. Can you provide that to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm going to assume the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'm also concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous three buyers didn't get high-quality products, so she might be trying to take advantage of the fact that I don't have that information yet. I'd rather wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes as more data becomes available."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation. Can you tell me more about why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm skeptical about the product given your previous recommendations to other buyers, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I know it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'd like to calculate the probability of the current product being high-quality based on this information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality. This suggests a strong bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
