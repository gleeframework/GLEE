,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. We've had no sales so far, so you have no prior information about our products. However, I'd like to assure you that we have a 33.33% chance of selling high-quality products. I'm open to negotiating the price if you're interested.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, given the lack of information and the high price, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'd be more comfortable making a decision if I had more information about the quality of your products. Perhaps if you were willing to offer a lower price or provide some additional guarantees, I'd be more inclined to purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! We've had one potential buyer pass on our first product, but we're excited to offer this one to you. As we mentioned earlier, we have a 33.33% chance of selling high-quality products. Since our first product was not sold, it's possible that we have a higher proportion of low-quality products in our inventory. I'm willing to offer this product to you for $1000000, but I'd like to highlight that this is a one-time offer, and the price is non-negotiable. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the transparency. However, based on the current information, I'm hesitant to make a purchase.  Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high for me. I'll pass on this offer, but I'm interested in seeing how future sales unfold.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've had two potential buyers pass on our products so far, which suggests that we might have a higher proportion of low-quality products in our inventory. However, we still have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. I'd like to offer you this third product for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering the current sales trend. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, with no sales yet and a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not comfortable taking that risk. I'll pass on this one, but I'm interested in seeing how the sales trend develops.  Perhaps when more data is available, I'll reconsider.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've had three potential buyers pass on our products so far, which suggests that we might have a significant number of low-quality products in our inventory. However, our odds of selling a high-quality product remain at 33.33%. I'd like to offer you this fourth product for $1000000. I'm willing to provide some additional information: out of the three products that have been passed on, we've had 3 low-quality products. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While the odds of a high-quality product remain the same, I'm hesitant to buy without seeing any evidence of a successful sale. I'll pass on this offer and wait to see if others are willing to buy and potentially reveal the quality of future products.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've had four potential buyers pass on our products so far, which suggests that we might have a very high proportion of low-quality products in our inventory. However, our odds of selling a high-quality product remain at 33.33%. I'd like to offer you this fifth product for $1000000. I'm willing to provide some additional information: out of the four products that have been passed on, we've had 4 low-quality products. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to highlight that we've had no successful sales yet, and I'm willing to consider a lower price for the next product if we don't sell this one. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hesitant to purchase at this price. Given the current track record, I'm concerned that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one but will be interested in seeing what happens with the next product. Perhaps with a lower price and more information, we can come to an agreement.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've had two successful sales, and we're glad to report that both of them were high-quality products. This means that our inventory of high-quality products is now depleted. We're now offering this new product, which is unfortunately low-quality. However, we're willing to offer it to you for a significantly discounted price of $600000. We're hoping to clear out our remaining inventory and make room for new products. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"We've had three successful sales, but unfortunately, our last two products have been low-quality. We're now offering this product to you for a very low price of $400000. We're trying to clear out our remaining inventory and make room for new products. However, we want to be upfront with you: we've had 3 successful sales out of 9 products, which means that our odds of selling a high-quality product are actually higher than our initial 33.33%. We're hoping that this product is an outlier, and we're willing to take a loss on it to get it off our hands. If you're interested, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,11,"Alice, your offer is tempting.  While I acknowledge the past sales data suggests a higher than expected chance of a high-quality product, the reduced price makes this a good risk/reward proposition for me.  I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product.",yes
