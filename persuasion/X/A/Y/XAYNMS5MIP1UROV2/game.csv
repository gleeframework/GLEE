,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality! That's a 50% success rate. You can be one of the lucky ones for just $100. It's a great opportunity to get a $400 product at a fraction of its value!",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take a chance! I'm hoping to be the lucky one!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're my 3rd customer! I'm glad you're interested in my products. I've sold 2 out of 3 so far, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually higher than the average! Don't miss out on this chance to get a great deal for just $100.",

However, I've also sold 3 low-quality products out of the last 3, which means I've had a 0% success rate in those rounds.
