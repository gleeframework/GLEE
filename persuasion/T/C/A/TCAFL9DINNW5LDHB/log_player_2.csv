Alice's message: You've done your research, I see. You're right that the prior probability is 50%. But now that I've sold 1 product, and it was low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality has decreased. I'd say it's now around 40% or less.

Alice's message: Let's break it down. I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, out of 2 total products. This is a clear indication that my initial assessment was incorrect. Given the data, the probability of a product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'd estimate it's around 25% or less.
