I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'm willing to be honest - I don't think it's high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and find out for yourself?""

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/7, which is roughly 28.57%. This is lower than I expected. Given that you're offering me a product that you've already revealed to be low-quality, I'm not convinced that your assessment of the product's quality is reliable.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality. I'm also considering the fact that you're offering it to me after having sold 18 products and 6 of them being high-quality. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'd expect to see a ratio of high-quality to low-quality products closer to 1:1. The fact that you've sold 6 high-quality products out of 18 suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%.
