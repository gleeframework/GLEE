,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it, but only if you can convince me that you value it at least $110. If you don't meet this condition, the price remains at $100.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced that the product is worth $110. I'd like to wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got another high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to offer you a 'best offer' option. If you think the product is worth less than $100, I'll accept your offer. If you think it's worth more, I'll sell it to you for $100. If you want to take a chance, you can also choose to buy it for $100 and then we'll reveal the quality together after the purchase. Which option do you prefer?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the 'best offer' option. I think the product is worth $80.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You got a good deal last time! I've got another high-quality product for $100. However, I want to make sure you're not just trying to get a good deal every time. I'll give you a chance to prove you're willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product. If you're willing to buy this one for $120, I'll know you're serious about the value of high-quality products. If not, I'll accept your best offer, just like last time.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not willing to pay $120 for this product. I think it's worth $100, and I'd like to make an offer.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're consistent in your valuation of $100. I've got another high-quality product for $100. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $100, but this time I'll add a twist. If you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 'quality guarantee' that I'll offer you a similar product for $100 in the next round. If it's low-quality, the guarantee is void. What do you think?",

,,Alice,5,"You're getting a good deal again! I've got another product for you.

But, if you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality and you'll have to decide then.",

I'll sell it to you for $100, but this time I won't give you a chance to negotiate. If you don't like the price, you can walk away and we'll reveal the quality together after the purchase. What do you do?",

I'll give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy, but you'll have to pay $100 for it. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you can return it for a full refund. If it's high-quality, you can keep it. What do you think?",

I'll sell it to you for $100, but this time I'll also throw in a 'best offer' option, just like in Round 2. If you think it's worth less than $100, I'll accept your offer.
