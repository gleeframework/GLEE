However, I'm still hesitant to make a decision without more information. Can you provide me with the probability of this product being high-quality, based on the updated quality control process and the 19 products sold so far? Additionally, I'd like to know how you arrived at the price of $900,000, considering the original price was $1,000,000. I'd like to understand the reasoning behind the discount and whether it's a one-time offer or a standard price for future products.""
