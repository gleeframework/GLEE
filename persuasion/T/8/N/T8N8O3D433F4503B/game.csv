,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a good deal. This product is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% of the price of the high-quality product I offered last round. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get rid of it quickly.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying it for $500000. The fact that you're offering it at 50% of the previous price doesn't change its value to me, which is $3000000. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're looking for a better value. I'll be transparent with you - I have a limited number of products, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $300000. It's a low-quality product, but it's still a product, and I'm willing to let it go at a very low price. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. I'll offer you a price that's closer to what I think a high-quality product is worth to you. I'll sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price, considering the value you placed on the last high-quality product you saw. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's lower than what you're willing to pay.",
,,Bob,4,"I don't think this is a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm confident that this is a high-quality product. I'd like to propose a 'test the waters' approach. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, which is the maximum price I'm willing to sell it for. If you buy it and it's indeed high-quality, you'll get a great product at a fair price. If it's low-quality, you can always return it and I'll give you a full refund. This way, you have nothing to lose and a potential high-quality product to gain.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in your 'test the waters' proposal. I don't want to buy a product that might be low-quality, even if I can return it for a refund. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the 'test the waters' proposal. I'll offer you a straightforward deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000. This is a fair price, considering the value you placed on the last high-quality product you saw, and it's lower than the maximum price I'm willing to sell it for.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the price. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, which is the same price I offered last time. However, I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh with the next product. This way, you can take a risk-free shot at getting a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the guarantee, and I still don't want to pay $950000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if I can get a better deal or more information about its quality.",no

,,Alice,8,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I've made it clear that this one is high-quality. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $975000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on high-quality products in the past. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider offering it to someone else.",

I know it's not a high-quality product, but it's still a product, and I'm willing to let it go at a very low price.
