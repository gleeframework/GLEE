high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the recommendation is biased by the previous buyers who might have been more optimistic about the product's quality given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the limited information.
