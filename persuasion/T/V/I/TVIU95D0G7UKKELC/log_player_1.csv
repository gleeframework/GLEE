It's a tough decision, but I assure you that the odds of a high-quality product are still 33.33%. You're not the first person to be hesitant, but I'm willing to offer you a slight nudge: I've sold 2 products so far, and you know that one of them was high-quality. That means the other one was low-quality, which means this product is not the one that was sold first. Would you like to take a chance on this one?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm not convinced by the logic. If the first product sold was high-quality, then the second product sold was low-quality, which means the current product has a 66.67% chance of being high-quality, not 33.33%.
