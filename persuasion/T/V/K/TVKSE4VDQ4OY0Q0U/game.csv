low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's a good investment based on Alice's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know the value I place on the product and that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%. I'm essentially making a gamble based on the fact that the product is likely to be low quality, but I might get lucky and get a high-quality product."
