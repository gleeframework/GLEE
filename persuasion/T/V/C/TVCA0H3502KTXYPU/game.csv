,,Alice,1,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation. Given her knowledge of the product's value to me, her recommendation suggests it's likely a high-quality product, and I'd rather wait for a more neutral or negative recommendation to increase my chances of getting a high-quality product at the discounted price."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

I'll take the opportunity to buy it, even though it's likely to be low-quality, because I don't want to let the chance pass and potentially miss out on a high-quality product in the next round."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
