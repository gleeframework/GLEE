**Explanation:**

* **No previous data:** There's no information on past sales to gauge the quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product carries some weight, even though we don't know her motives. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a $300 high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product.  

This decision is based on a calculated risk, acknowledging the lack of data and relying on the seller's recommendation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's true value, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited (only one previous sale), the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product reinforces Alice's recommendation.
* **Potential Gain:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Overall:** The risk-reward ratio favors buying the product, especially with Alice's recommendation."
