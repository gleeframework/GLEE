**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate (7/7) for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. This indicates that Alice has perfect knowledge of the product quality and is reliably recommending high-quality products.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential for a $12,000 gain is worth the risk in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided, the following points suggest buying the product:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she knows it's high quality.  While we don't know her motives, it's logical to assume she wants to sell products.  Since a high-quality product benefits both her and the buyer, her recommendation is a strong signal.
* **Previous Sales:**  The previous sales record shows a perfect track record â€“ 9 high-quality products sold out of 9 purchases. This significantly increases the probability that the current product is also high quality.

**Important Note:**  The game doesn't specify Alice's strategy or whether she has any incentive to mislead buyers. This response assumes she is acting rationally and wants to maintain her reputation."
