high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for sale for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm hoping to change that. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go by.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 1 total sales. I still have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take a chance and buy it for $100. I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of 2 total sales. Given the high probability of selling high-quality products, it's likely that this product is low-quality. However, I'm only 2 for 2 so far, so there's still a chance it's high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total sales, and 2 out of my last 3 products were high-quality. This suggests a higher probability of a high-quality product, but I still have 2 low-quality products remaining. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy it for $100, considering the higher probability of a high-quality product based on your sales record.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total sales, and 3 out of my last 4 products were high-quality. Given the streak, I'm likely to have a low-quality product left. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced by your argument. The streak of high-quality products could be just a coincidence. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total sales, and 3 out of my last 4 products were high-quality. However, I've now sold a low-quality product, which suggests that the streak was indeed a coincidence. I'm back to a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product for $100, considering the previous high-quality streak and the 80% chance of selling a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total sales, and 4 out of my last 5 products were high-quality. Given this strong evidence, I'm likely to have a high-quality product.

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total sales, and 5 out of my last 6 products were high-quality.

Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Your sales record suggests that the probability of a low-quality product is higher than I initially thought, but the potential reward is still worth the risk.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total sales, and 6 out of my last 7 products were high-quality. However, I've now sold 3 low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of selling a low-quality product is actually higher than the initial 20%. I want to be transparent about the risks. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the updated statistics, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I understand that the probability of a low-quality product is higher than initially thought, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product worth $400 to me.",yes
