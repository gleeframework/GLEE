However, I'd like to propose a different perspective: what if the first two high-quality products were indeed just a coincidence, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%? If that's the case, then buying this product would be a good opportunity to get a high-quality item at a lower price. I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the risk, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.""
