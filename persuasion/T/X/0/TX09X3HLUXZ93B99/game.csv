,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it because I have no prior information to go off of. I'm essentially making a blind bet. I'll keep an eye on the future sales to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than 80%.",yes

I'm glad you're interested in understanding how I calculate the probability. I use a simple Bayesian update based on the number of high-quality and low-quality products sold. The initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and with each new sale, I update the probability based on the observed data.
