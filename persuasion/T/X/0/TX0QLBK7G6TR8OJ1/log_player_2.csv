  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high-quality. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 products, and each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I'm going to do some quick math to estimate the probability of the current product being high-quality. Assuming the products are independent and identically distributed, the probability that none of the first 3 products were high-quality is (2/3)^3 = 8/27. Therefore, the probability that the current product is high-quality, given that the first 3 were not, is 1 - 8/27 = 19/27. This is less than 1/2, so I'm inclined to pass on this product.""
