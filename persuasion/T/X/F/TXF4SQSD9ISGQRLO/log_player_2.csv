**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the quality of the product and Alice's recommendation doesn't give you any extra information, you are essentially making a 50/50 gamble. The expected value of buying is:

0.5 * $120 (high quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low quality) = $60

The expected value of passing is $0.  Therefore, buying is the better option in this case."
