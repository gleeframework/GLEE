,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the first product before making a decision, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather data to make informed decisions in the future."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and the probability of it being low-quality is still 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might be a red flag, and I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's track record of 0 high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low sales record. I'm hoping that the low sales are due to the low quality of the products being sold, and I'm taking a chance that this one might be high quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold yet.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 4, which is lower than the expected 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
