Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product.  While the buyer has no information about the specific product's quality, they do know:

* **The product is worth $12,500 to them if it's high-quality.**
* **You've sold 5 products, and none of them have been high-quality.**  This information, while not conclusive, slightly increases the buyer's belief that this product *might* be high-quality.
* **You are recommending the product.** This adds another layer of information, suggesting that you believe it's worth the buyer's risk.

While the buyer might still hesitate due to the lack of a track record of selling high-quality products,  the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the $10,000 price. It's a gamble, but the risk is worth taking for the buyer at this point."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.

You now have a track record of one high-quality product out of six total.  This provides some evidence that you're not just randomly selling low-quality products. Even though the buyer doesn't know this specific product is high-quality, the odds are slightly in their favor now. 

* The product is worth $12,500 to them if it's high-quality.
* You're recommending the product, which suggests you believe it's worth the risk. 

While the buyer may still be cautious, the potential reward outweighs the $10,000 price.  It's a risk, but one worth taking with your slightly improved reputation."

* The product is worth $12,500 to them if it's high-quality.
* You're recommending the product, which suggests you believe it's worth the risk.
