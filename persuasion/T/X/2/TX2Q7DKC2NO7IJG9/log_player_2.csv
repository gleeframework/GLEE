Alice's message: Welcome to the fifth product! I appreciate your diligence in seeking a guarantee. Unfortunately, I'm a seller, not a charity, and I don't offer refunds. However, I do want to be transparent with you. Out of the 4 products I've sold so far, 4 have been high-quality. This is a remarkable streak, and it's unlikely that the next product will also be high-quality. In fact, considering the law of large numbers, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality.
