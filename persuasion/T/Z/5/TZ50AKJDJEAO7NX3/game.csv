high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, I've seen that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
