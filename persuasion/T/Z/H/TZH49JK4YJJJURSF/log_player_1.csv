I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a 50% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our business relationship.""
}"

}"

However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering you a unique opportunity to inspect the product's packaging and documentation. This will give you a chance to verify that it's not a high-quality item. If you're still interested, I'll sell it to you for $0, and you can keep the packaging and documentation as a keepsake.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even for $0. If I buy it, I'll just be wasting my time and resources on something that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this offer.
