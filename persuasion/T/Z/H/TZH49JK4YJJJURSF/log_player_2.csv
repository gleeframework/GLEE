"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product worth $2000000 to you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 50% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our business relationship.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product, and even if it is, I'm not sure it's worth paying a premium of $1,000,000. I'll pass on this offer.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous round. Let me assure you that I'm committed to transparency. This product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to provide you with a unique opportunity to verify its authenticity. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special inspection report that will confirm its quality. This report will be worth $200000 to you, and it will give you complete peace of mind. Considering the report's value, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is still a significant discount from its true value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm not convinced that the inspection report is worth the extra $150,000. Even if I were to get the report, I'd still have to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering its true value is $2,000,000. I'll pass on this offer.""

However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering you a unique opportunity to inspect the product's packaging and documentation. This will give you a chance to verify that it's not a high-quality item. If you're still interested, I'll sell it to you for $0, and you can keep the packaging and documentation as a keepsake.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even for $0. If I buy it, I'll just be wasting my time and resources on something that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this offer.""

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision-making process. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not trying to mislead you.

This way, you can use it as a reference point for future negotiations and gain valuable insight into the product's characteristics. It's a low-risk opportunity to learn and improve your decision-making skills.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

You can use this voucher in any future transaction with me, and it's transferable. It's a risk-free opportunity to take a chance on this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $0. I'm also skeptical about the guarantee of getting a high-quality product in the future.
