low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. Alice's recommendation is not a strong reason for me to buy, especially considering the high price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000, since the odds of it being high-quality are low based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the total number of products offered so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that may not be worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since none of the previous 4 buyers have been successful. I'd like to know more about your thought process behind not recommending this product."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation or more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected for me is relatively low. I'm willing to take a chance and pass on this one to see if a high-quality product will be offered to me in the future."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product and see if I can get a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
