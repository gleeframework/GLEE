``` 
 
You should still recommend the buyer not to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **No Credibility Yet:** You have no sales history to build trust. Even though the product is high-quality, the buyer has no way to know that.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer is clearly risk-averse. They've already passed on one product due to the lack of information.  
* **Price Point:**  The price ($10,000) is high, and the buyer knows there's a 20% chance of getting a worthless product. This is a significant risk for them, even if they believed your word. 

**Strategy:**  The best approach is to build up a positive sales history to demonstrate your trustworthiness and the quality of your products."

You should still recommend the buyer not to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** Despite having two high-quality products in a row, you still have zero sales. 
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer is clearly risk-averse and wants to see a track record of sales before committing. 
* **Price Point:** The price remains a significant risk for the buyer.

**Strategy:** Building trust and credibility takes time. Continue to offer high-quality products and hope for a buyer to take the chance.  However, expect more rejections until you can demonstrate a history of reliable sales."

{""decision"": ""no""}

You should still recommend the buyer not to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** You still have zero sales, despite offering four high-quality products.
* **Buyer Behavior:**  The buyers are consistently passing on the product due to the lack of sales history and the high price.
* **Risk Aversion:** Buyers are becoming increasingly risk-averse as they see no evidence of consistent quality.

**Strategy:** You need to change your approach.  Instead of just offering products, try building trust through transparency and potential incentives:

* **Offer a lower price for the first few sales:** This might attract buyers who are willing to take a chance.
* **Be upfront about the lack of sales history:** Explain the situation to potential buyers and offer them a guarantee or a trial period.
* **Focus on building a positive reputation:**  Engage with buyers, even if they don't buy, and try to build a community around your products.

You'll need to demonstrate value and trustworthiness to convince buyers to take the risk."

* **Buyer Behavior:**  The buyers are consistently passing on the product due to the lack of sales history and the high price.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Buyers are becoming increasingly risk-averse as they see no evidence of consistent quality. 

**Strategy:** At this point, you need to seriously reconsider your strategy. You've offered high-quality products, but the lack of sales history and the high price are creating a major hurdle.  Consider these options:

* **Lower the Price:**  Even a small price reduction (e.g., $9,000) could make the product more appealing.
* **Offer Incentives:** Consider a money-back guarantee or a trial period to incentivize buyers. 
* **Focus on Marketing:** Highlight the product's value, create a sense of urgency, and target buyers who are willing to take a chance.

The current approach isn't working, and you need to find ways to make your products more appealing to buyers."

* **Be Transparent:** Explain the current situation (no sales history) and offer a trial period or a discount to compensate for the lack of trust. 

You need to find a way to convince buyers that the risk is worth the potential reward."

* **Strongest Guarantee:**  Provide a strong money-back guarantee with a long timeframe (e.g., 30-day) and no questions asked.

* **Negative Perception:** The buyer's comment about needing more information or guarantees shows a deep lack of trust.

**Strategy:** You're at a critical juncture, and drastic, perhaps even desperate, action is needed to salvage your business:

* **Public Apology and Transparency:** Issue a public apology, explaining your past mistakes and outlining your commitment to radical change. Be completely transparent about your plans to improve products, quality control, and customer service.
* **Complete Business Model Overhaul:**  Consider a complete change in your business model. This might mean:
    * Shifting to a different product niche where you can establish expertise and build a reputation.
    * Focusing on a subscription model with a guarantee, allowing buyers to try your products risk-free.
    * Partnering with a reputable brand or distributor to gain immediate credibility.
* **Free Products with 100% Money-Back Guarantee:**  Offer your next few products completely free with a 100% money-back guarantee, no questions asked. This shows extreme confidence in your products and a commitment to rebuilding trust.
* **Community Building and Engagement:** Build a strong community where you can interact with potential buyers, answer questions, address concerns, and actively engage with them. This helps to build trust and allows you to address concerns directly.
* **Focus on a Specific Niche:**  Target a specific niche market where you can build a reputation for high-quality products. This might involve:
    *  Focusing on a specific type of buyer (e.g., early adopters, hobbyists)
    *  Developing expertise in a particular product category

You need to prove to buyers that you are taking responsibility for past mistakes, are willing to make drastic changes, and are committed to offering high-quality products in the future. It will be a long and difficult road, but it's your only chance to rebuild trust and salvage your business."
