I'm willing to give you a free, non-binding, and non-transferable guarantee: if you buy this product and in the next 5 rounds, I sell at least 4 high-quality products, I'll give you a full refund of $100, plus an additional $50. This way, you'll essentially get the product for free if I'm selling a lot of high-quality products. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I've just sold a low-quality product.

I'm not offering any guarantees or refunds this time. The price remains $100. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, which is a bit better than the 33.33% probability. However, I've just sold a low-quality product again. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not getting a good feel for the quality of my products so far. I'm offering a 'tough love' deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a detailed explanation of what went wrong and how I'm going to improve my product quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the standard $100 product. What do you think?",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it: my products are not meeting expectations. I'm offering a 'buyer beware' deal: I'm selling this product as-is, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. The price remains $100. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the risk and buy it. If not, I completely understand.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, and 3 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think that my previous 'buyer beware' deal was a bit too generous. Let me be clear: I'm not making any promises about the quality of this product. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's low-quality. But if you want to buy it, I'll give you a deal: I'll throw in a free 'I told you so' note, signed by me. The price remains $100. What do you think?",
