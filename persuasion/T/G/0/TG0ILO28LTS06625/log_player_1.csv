"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, it's worth $300 to Bob. This is significantly higher than the $100 selling price. Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the expected value of the product is positive for him:

* Expected value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
* Expected value = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240

Therefore, it is recommended that Bob buys the product."

* Expected value = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240
