,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the 80% chance of it being high-quality, and I'm aware that this is just a statement from you, not a guarantee. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm not relying solely on your statement.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Hello there! I appreciate your cautious approach. Remember, our high-quality products come with an 80% chance of meeting and exceeding your expectations. Your decision is based on statistical probability, not a guarantee, which aligns well with your risk assessment. Trust in our commitment to excellence, and let's make a wise investment together.",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

I'd like to assess the situation more accurately before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Greetings! I understand your desire for more data. So far, we've sold a total of 100 products, out of which 80 were of high quality. This translates to a high-quality product ratio of 80%. Our track record speaks to our dedication to quality. While individual outcomes are uncertain, our overall performance suggests a strong likelihood of satisfaction. Let's continue building trust through transparency and quality.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the high-quality product ratio might be skewed by the fact that only one buyer has purchased so far. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products among the first 100 sales, and if there's any data on the quality of the products that were not purchased.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I acknowledge your concern regarding the distribution of high-quality products. To provide clarity, among the first 100 sales, 80 were indeed high-quality, and the remaining 20 were of lower quality. This distribution indicates a consistent pattern of quality across our products. We're committed to maintaining this standard. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to ask.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the clarification on the product quality distribution. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product. I'm assuming that the quality of the current product is independent of the previous sales, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'll take it.",yes

If you have any further questions or need additional assurance, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your confidence in the quality of your products. However, I'm a bit concerned that the 80% ratio might be due to a coincidence rather than a true reflection of the product's quality. Could you provide more information about the total number of products you've sold so far, including the ones that were discarded?",yes
