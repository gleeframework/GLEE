"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Decision: Yes** - It's always better to buy in this scenario, given the high probability of the product being high quality (80%). 
* **Message:**  A simple and polite message acknowledging Alice's recommendation.

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) far outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).  This strategy maximizes your potential gains over the 20 rounds."

Round 2

**Explanation:**

* **Decision: Yes** - The same logic applies as in Round 1.  The high probability of a high-quality product makes buying always the better choice in this game.
* **Message:**  A short and positive message, acknowledging the recommendation.

**Reasoning:**

Even with the knowledge that the first product was high-quality, the odds for each individual product remain the same (80% high quality, 20% low quality). The potential for a $2,000,000 profit continues to outweigh the risk of losing $1,000,000."

* **Unprecedented situation:** Alice's previous recommendations have consistently been profitable. This sudden change in strategy raises a question: has she suddenly gained knowledge about the quality of this specific product?  
* **Risk aversion:** With the game ending, the potential loss of $1,000,000 carries more weight than the potential gain of $2,000,000. This is a risk-averse approach in the final round.
* **Learning opportunity:**  By passing, you avoid a potential loss and can observe if Alice's recommendation was actually correct. 

This decision, while breaking the established pattern of buying, demonstrates a logical shift in strategy at the end of the game."
