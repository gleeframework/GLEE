**Explanation:**

This decision is based on a simple Bayesian reasoning approach:

* **Prior Belief:** Initially, there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality.
* **Evidence:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. We don't know her exact strategy, but if she recommends only high-quality products, she would have a much higher success rate. 
* **Posterior Belief:**  The fact that one high-quality product was already sold with Alice's recommendation further strengthens the belief that this product is also likely high quality.

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward (+$250,000) outweighs the risk, especially given the seller's past performance."
