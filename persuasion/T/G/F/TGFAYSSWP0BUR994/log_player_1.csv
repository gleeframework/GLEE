The buyer has no information to go on except that Alice didn't recommend the last product.  Since the buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, there is no reason to believe that this round's product is any different.

Alice should still recommend against buying the product. There is no reason to believe that the product is high-quality, and since it's only worth $0 to the buyer if it's low-quality, it's not worth the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should still recommend against buying the product. Even though this product is actually high-quality, Alice has no way of communicating that to the buyer.

The buyer is likely to pass, as they are still wary of buying from Alice."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet, I'd prefer to pass on this one. I'll see how other buyers fare and come back later if there's a trend emerging.
