**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have information about one previous buyer, who bought a high-quality product. This doesn't give us a strong statistical basis for making a decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She has access to the actual quality of the product, and her recommendation suggests she believes it's high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($200) is significantly higher than the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0). 

Given the lack of strong statistical evidence to the contrary and the positive signal from Alice, it's reasonable to take a chance and buy the product."
