Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're pleased with the previous products, and I'm excited to offer you another opportunity.

But if you're not interested, I completely understand and will move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Although I've been prioritizing high-quality products, the significant discount you're offering changes the risk-reward calculation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in this offer.

It's a risk, but it's also an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially revolutionary product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency about the product's limitations, but I'm still not convinced.
