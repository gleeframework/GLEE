Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 6 so far, which is a 16.67% success rate. To be honest, I'm a bit worried that I might be a high-quality product outlier, and most of my products are actually low-quality. This one is probably one of them.

Alice's message: You're right to be concerned about the recent streak of low-quality products! But let me put things into perspective: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is a 25% success rate. That's actually higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). So, it's actually more likely that the next product will be high-quality than not! And you can get this one for $100, so what do you say?
