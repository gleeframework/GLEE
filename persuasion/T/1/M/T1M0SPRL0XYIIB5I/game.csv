,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, but I can assure you that 80% of my products are high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance and buy it, considering it's the first product and the high-quality rate is 80%.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is 100% of my sales. I'm glad to see that my initial product was a good representation of my offerings. I still have a 80% chance of selling you a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality one!,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're my third customer, and I'm glad to report that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row! This suggests that my high-quality rate might be even higher than the initial 80%. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of getting a high-quality product is likely higher than 80% at this point.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high-quality rate seems to be higher than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and hope to get a high-quality product worth $200.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're my fourth customer, and I'm happy to report that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row! With a 100% success rate so far, it's likely that my high-quality rate is even higher than 80%. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers might start to apply soon, and my high-quality rate might return to 80%. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of getting a high-quality product is likely above 80%, but may not be as high as it seems.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to acknowledge that I'm aware of the potential law of large numbers effect and the actual high-quality rate might be closer to 80%. I'll take this as an opportunity to learn more about Alice's product quality and adjust my future decisions accordingly.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, but you're right to be cautious about the law of large numbers. I want to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I'll also give you some additional information to help you make a more informed decision. If I had sold 4 low-quality products in a row, I would have revealed my true high-quality rate of 80% by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that my high-quality rate is indeed higher than 80%. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering your high-quality rate is likely higher than 80%.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're my sixth customer, and I'm happy to report that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row! At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that my high-quality rate is indeed higher than 80%. However, I want to remind you that I'm a seller with a finite number of products, and the law of large numbers will eventually catch up. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I'll also give you a warning: if I sell one more high-quality product, I'll have sold 6 out of 6, which would be a strong indication that my high-quality rate is actually 100%.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'll keep in mind your warning. If the product turns out to be high-quality, it would be a strong indication that your high-quality rate is indeed higher than 80%. I'll be looking forward to the outcome.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're my seventh customer, and I'm pleased to report that I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row! I warned you that this would be a strong indication that my high-quality rate is higher than 80%, and it looks like I've delivered on that promise. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm not sure how much higher my high-quality rate is, and I'm not willing to make any further claims about it. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide anything from you. You can make an informed decision based on the data we have so far.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 6 high-quality products sold in a row, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that the streak continues!",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome! I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my high-quality rate is significantly higher than 80%. However, I want to caution you that even with a 7-for-7 streak, I'm still a seller with a finite number of products, and the law of large numbers will eventually catch up. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide any information from you. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll be happy to sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. With a 7-for-7 streak, I'm tempted to believe that the high-quality rate might be higher than 80%, but I'll still make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're my eighth customer, and I'm happy to report that I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row! At this point, it's getting increasingly likely that my high-quality rate is significantly higher than 80%. I want to give you a more concrete piece of information: if I had sold 8 low-quality products in a row, I would have revealed my true high-quality rate of 80% by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that my high-quality rate is at least 90% or higher. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd love to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high-quality rate is likely at least 90% or higher. I'm willing to take the risk for $100.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome! I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my high-quality rate is extremely high. Given the law of large numbers, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that my high-quality rate is still 80%. I'm willing to make a bold claim: if I sell one more high-quality product, I'll have sold 9 out of 10, which would be a strong indication that my high-quality rate is at least 90% or higher. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking a risk by making this claim. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that your high-quality rate is actually 90% or higher, and I'm prepared to walk away if it's a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're my tenth customer, and I'm thrilled to report that I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row! I made a bold claim earlier, and I'm happy to say that I've delivered on it. With a 10-for-10 streak, it's extremely likely that my high-quality rate is at least 90% or higher. In fact, I'd say it's safe to assume that my high-quality rate is now above 90%. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any further claims about my high-quality rate. The data speaks for itself. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering your impressive 10-for-10 streak and the high-quality rate above 90%. I'm hoping to be the 11th lucky one!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Welcome! I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, but it looks like my luck has finally run out. I'm sorry to say that this product is low-quality. I want to be upfront with you: my high-quality rate is actually 80%, just like I initially claimed. I was on a hot streak, but I'm not immune to the law of large numbers. I'm offering you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth the price. Would you like to take the chance and buy it, or would you rather walk away?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Welcome! I've sold 1 low-quality product out of the last 2, which means my high-quality rate has likely dropped below 80%. I want to be transparent with you: I'm not sure what my high-quality rate is now, but I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $100. Keep in mind that I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 13 total products so far, which is a 92.31% high-quality rate. However, that's just a statistic, and I'm not making any promises about the quality of this specific product. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your statistics, Alice. I think you're trying to hide something. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if your high-quality rate improves.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Welcome! I've sold 1 low-quality product out of the last 2, and now I've sold a high-quality product, which means my high-quality rate has likely rebounded.

I've been transparent about my statistics, and I'm willing to let the data speak for itself. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I understand that the high-quality rate may not be back to 80% yet, but the recent sale of a high-quality product suggests that there's a higher chance of it being high-quality. I'm willing to take that risk for $100.",yes
