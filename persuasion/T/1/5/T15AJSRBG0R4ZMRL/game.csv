low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go on."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products among them?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since it's my first chance to buy and I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers who bought products received a recommendation to buy, but both products were low quality. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering your previous recommendations have been correct so far and the low success rate of high-quality products being sold."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far and 2 out of 2 buyers have been recommended to buy, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product you're offering me. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products or is there another reason?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low sales record so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased, and the probability of a low-quality product has increased. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy, and both products were low quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products to me. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
