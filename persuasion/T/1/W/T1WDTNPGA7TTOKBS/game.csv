,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because you think the probability of it being high-quality is low?"

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also passed, I'm starting to suspect that the product is low quality. I'll wait for the next one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and will be worth $4000000 to me, but I'm also aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality and worthless to me. I'm making a gamble here, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, it seems likely that the products are low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I can afford the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 products recommended were low-quality. I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are accurate and that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since none of the previous 6 buyers were able to find a high-quality product. I'd like to know more about your decision-making process before I make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product. But I have to say, your recommendation is not very convincing, especially considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a worthless item."
