,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'll be the first to set the precedent."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, as I don't know what the product is worth to me, and I'm trying to figure out your recommendation strategy. Also, I'm a bit concerned that if I pass, the product might be a high-quality one and be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not very informative. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm not getting a good sense of the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a better sense of the product's quality by taking the risk and buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what the statistics are for the previous 3 buyers. How many products were sold to them, and how many of those were high-quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you haven't recommended it, I'm assuming it's low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products offered to them, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended against it, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high quality. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit your lack of information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality based on the statistics. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it. If I were to buy it, it would be a gamble, and I might end up with a low-quality product worth $0. I'd like to see the next product or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I want to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and how you came to this conclusion?"

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight given the low success rate of previous buyers. I'm hoping to be the exception."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product, and that 8 out of 8 previous buyers also didn't buy, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
