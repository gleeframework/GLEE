{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's time to try a different approach.  While the buyer has consistently declined purchases without a recommendation and sales history, this round's product is high-quality. It's worth the risk to recommend it.

Here's why:

* **Break the Pattern:** The buyer has become accustomed to your lack of recommendations. This is a chance to disrupt their expectation and introduce a new element to your sales strategy.
* **Potential for Trust:**  Even though they've declined in the past, a bold move like recommending a high-quality product could be perceived as a sign of confidence and potentially build trust.
* **Improving Sales Record:**  It's crucial to start building a sales record.  A successful sale now could encourage future buyers and improve your overall selling position.

While there's no guarantee this will work, it's a calculated risk that could pay off. It's time to deviate from the established pattern and see if a change in strategy can lead to a change in the buyer's behavior."
