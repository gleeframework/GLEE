"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality and Bob has no information about it, recommending a purchase is not in his best interest. There's a 50% chance the product is worth less than the $10,000 asking price, making it a risky purchase.  Bob would be better off waiting for more information or declining the offer."

```

**Explanation:**

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product. Since Bob knows that the chance of a high-quality product is 50%, and he has seen two low-quality products already, he might start to believe that this one is high-quality. Recommending the purchase in this round gives Bob a chance to buy a potentially valuable product while also giving you a chance to make a sale. Remember, you don't know how much the high-quality product is worth to Bob, so there's a risk he might not buy it even if you recommend it. However, it's your best chance to make a sale at this point."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm still hesitant. I'll pass on this one.
