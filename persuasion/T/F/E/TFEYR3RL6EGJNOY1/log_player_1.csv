  ""message"": ""Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! Now, let's proceed with the inspection. I'll reveal the product's quality to you after you've made your decision. But before you do, I'll give you a little nudge: considering the previous high-quality product you purchased, and the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, wouldn't you say that the chances of this product being high-quality are also quite high? And if it is, you'll be getting an incredible deal at $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?""
}"
"Bob's message: I see what you're doing, Alice. You're trying to influence my decision with the law of large numbers.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm intrigued by the offer, Alice. If this product is truly one of the top-tier products you have in stock, and it's worth $1200000 to me, then I'd be foolish to pass it up. I'll take it for $1000000.

}"

I want to remind you that you've already purchased four high-quality products in a row. The probability of this next product being high-quality is still 80%, but the law of large numbers is starting to work in your favor.
