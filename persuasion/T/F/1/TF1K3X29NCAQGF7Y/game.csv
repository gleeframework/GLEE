,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice might be recommending against the high-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more promising opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending me to pass on it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be high quality. Can you provide more context or information about the product?"

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I'm suspicious that all the previous products were low-quality.
