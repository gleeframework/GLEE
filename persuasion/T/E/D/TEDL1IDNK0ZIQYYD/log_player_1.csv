``` 

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and Bob has consistently bought the products in the past rounds, we can assume he is valuing the high-quality products. It is unlikely that he would continue buying if he were not getting value for his money. Therefore, it is safe to assume that Bob would not buy a low-quality product, as he would not be getting value for his money."
