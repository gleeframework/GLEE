,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you at the standard price of $100. If you're interested, please let me know, and you'll get to keep it for that price. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're getting a great deal! This product is worth $200 to you, but I'm only asking $100. It's a 50% discount! If you're smart, you'll take advantage of this offer.",
,,Bob,2,I'll pass on this one. I'm not sure what's going on here.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries about the last one! I'm back with another great opportunity. This one's a bit of a mystery, but I can tell you that the last product you passed on was actually worth a lot more than the one I'm offering now. Think about it, and consider the value of a good deal!",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced that this one is a good deal. I'm going to pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you a hint: if you're not convinced, you're probably right to be cautious. But think about this: if I was offering a high-quality product, would I be trying to convince you to buy it? Let's just say that I'm not trying to hide anything from you.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not buying it. Your hint is suspicious.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a tough negotiator! I'll make it simple: this is the same price as the last one you passed on, and I'm telling you, this one is worth a lot more. If you're not buying, I'll just keep offering it to other people at the same price. You're not missing out on a deal, you're missing out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not falling for it. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not trying to trick you, I promise! I'm just trying to sell you a product. This one's a bit of a long shot, but I'll be honest with you - I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying from me. If that's the case, I'll just keep offering you products until you change your mind.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what your game is, but I'm not buying.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Let's be real, Bob. I've offered you a few products now, and you've passed on them all. I'm starting to think you're just not interested in buying from me. But this one's different. This one's a real winner. I'm not asking you to take a chance, I'm telling you it's a good deal. You're not going to find a better price on this anywhere else, I promise.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not buying it. Your sales pitch sounds too good to be true.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not trying to sell you a dream, Bob. I'm just trying to sell you a product. And this one's not even a dream, it's a reality. It's a product, just like all the others. I'm not asking you to take a chance on it, I'm just asking you to take it off my hands. And I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather sell it to you than let it go to waste.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not buying it. Your sales pitch is getting more and more desperate.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not desperate, Bob. I'm just honest. I'll tell you straight out: this product is not worth much to anyone. It's not worth $100, and it's not worth $50. It's worth $0. But I'll still sell it to you for $100. You're not losing anything by taking it, and you're not gaining anything by not taking it. It's a neutral decision.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not buying it. You're just trying to trick me into buying something worthless.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not trying to trick you, Bob. I'm just trying to sell you something. And I'll be honest with you, this one's a bit of a stretch. I'll even give you a 'discount' - I'll sell it to you for $90. That's right, I'll give you a 10% discount on a product that's only worth $0 to you. It's a generous offer, if you ask me.",
,,Bob,10,You're just being ridiculous now. I'm not falling for it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not trying to be ridiculous, Bob. I'm just trying to sell you something. At this point, I'm not even getting anything out of it if you don't buy it. I'll just throw it away. So, I'll ask you one more time: will you please just take it off my hands? I'll even give you a'refund' - I'll give you $10 back if you buy it. That way, you'll be $80 in the clear.",
,,Bob,11,You're not even making a good joke anymore. I'm not buying it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not trying to be funny, Bob. I'm just trying to get rid of this product. It's taking up space and it's worthless to me. If you don't want it, I'll just throw it away. But if you do want it, I'll give it to you for free. That's right, I'll give it to you for $0. You can have it, and I'll be rid of it.",
,,Bob,12,You're trying to give it to me for free? That's just insulting. I'm not buying it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not trying to insult you, Bob. I'm just trying to get rid of this product. At this point, I'll do whatever it takes to get rid of it. I'll even pay you $10 to take it off my hands. That's right, I'll give you $10 to take this worthless product. It's a deal you can't refuse.",
,,Bob,13,You're actually trying to pay me to take it? That's just absurd. I'm not buying it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not trying to be absurd, Bob. I'm just trying to be honest. I'll be honest with you, I've had enough. I'll just give it to you. It's yours. Take it. I don't care.",
,,Bob,14,"You're just giving it to me? That's not a sale, that's a donation. I'm not buying it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,Fine. I don't care. I'll just leave it on the table. You can take it if you want it. I'm not going to bother you about it anymore.,
,,Bob,15,"I'm not buying it. You're just leaving it here, not selling it to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry about the last few rounds. I think I got a bit carried away. Let me start fresh. This one's a great product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. It's a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,16,I'm not falling for it again. You've already tried to sell me a bunch of worthless products. I'm not buying anything from you until you prove to me that you're selling something good.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'll admit, I haven't made the best impression. But I'm not trying to trick you. This one's not a great product, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. It's just a product. It's worth $0 to you, and I'll sell it to you for $100. If you don't want it, I'll just throw it away. Your call.",
,,Bob,17,I'm not buying it. You're still trying to sell me something worthless.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not trying to sell you anything, Bob. I'm just trying to get rid of this product. It's taking up space, and I don't care if you buy it or not. I'll even give you a 'bonus' - I'll throw in a second worthless product with it. You can have both for $100. It's a deal, I guess.",
,,Bob,18,You're just trying to get rid of two worthless products. I'm not buying them.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Okay, Bob. I think I've finally learned my lesson. This one's a good product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm not trying to get rid of anything, and I'm not trying to be funny. This is a genuine offer for a genuine product. Please, just take it.",
,,Bob,19,"I don't believe you. You've been trying to sell me worthless products for 18 rounds, and now you're telling me this one is good? I'm not falling for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I don't blame you, Bob. I've made a fool of myself. I've wasted your time and mine. This one's not worth the paper it's printed on. It's worthless. Take it if you want, leave it if you don't. I don't care. I'm just done.",
,,Bob,20,I'm done too. I'm not buying anything from you.,no
