Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Let's calculate the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics so far:

* 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold (2/5 = 40%)
* 3 low-quality products out of 5 total products sold (3/5 = 60%)

However, I should consider the fact that the last product sold was high-quality, which changes the probability. Let's recalculate:

* 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold (3/6 = 50%)
* 3 low-quality products out of 6 total products sold (3/6 = 50%)

Since the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.

However, since the last product sold was high-quality, I'll update the probability to 3/10 ≈ 30%.

I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the initial 50% probability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation from you, did not find the product valuable.
