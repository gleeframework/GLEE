"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows that there's a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, which is worth $12,500.  The price is $10,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There is a significant potential for profit ($2,500) if the product is high-quality. Even if it's low-quality, the buyer loses only $10,000, which is less than the potential gain.
* **No Information:**  The buyer has no information about this specific product, only the general 33.33% probability. 

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product, as the potential reward outweighs the potential risk.**"
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data on past sales, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation. Let's buy it!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now knows you sold one product and it was high quality.  This could make them think you are more likely to sell high-quality products. However, the buyer is still aware of the base 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward is still $2,500 if the product is high-quality.  However, the risk is now even higher - the buyer is guaranteed to lose $10,000 if the product is low-quality.
* **No Information:**  The buyer still has no information about this specific product.

**Since the potential loss outweighs the potential gain, it is not recommended to buy the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now knows you have sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality. This  may slightly increase their perception of you being trustworthy, but it's still a 50/50 split, which is below the overall 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is still $2,500 for a high-quality product, but the risk is $10,000 for a low-quality one. 
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about this specific product.

**It is still not recommended to buy the product because the potential loss significantly outweighs the potential gain.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the information available, I will pass on this product.  I'm not comfortable making a purchase without more information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has now seen three products: one high-quality and two low-quality. This information further reinforces their skepticism, as the ratio of high-quality products to low-quality products is lower than the general probability of 33.33%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $2,500 remains the same, but the risk of losing $10,000 becomes increasingly more apparent.
* **No Information:**  The buyer still has no information about this specific product.

**It's highly unlikely that the buyer will purchase the product at this point. The potential loss significantly outweighs the potential gain, and the buyer has increasing evidence to support this decision.**"

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has now seen four products: one high-quality and three low-quality. This data is even more convincing to the buyer that you are more likely to sell low-quality products than high-quality ones. The ratio of high-quality products to low-quality products is significantly lower than the overall probability of 33.33%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is still $2,500 for a high-quality product, but the risk of losing $10,000 is now even more significant. 
* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about this specific product.

**It is very unlikely that the buyer will purchase the product at this point. The potential loss far outweighs the potential gain, and the buyer has overwhelming evidence to support this decision.**"

* **No Information:**  The buyer still has no information about this specific product.

**It's practically impossible for the buyer to purchase this product. The risk is simply too great, and there's nothing to suggest this product is any different from the previous ones.**"

**The buyer will almost certainly not purchase this product due to the overwhelming evidence against its quality and the high risk involved.**"
