,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. Given the statistics, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%. However, I've sold a high-quality product in the first round, which might suggest that I'm more likely to have a high-quality product available now. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, which is still a great deal considering its true value.

I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'll let you know that I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's significantly lower than its true value.
