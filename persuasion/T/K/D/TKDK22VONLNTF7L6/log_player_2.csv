"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, it's still beneficial to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is calculated as: (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96. This means, on average, you'll make a profit of $96 per product if you buy consistently.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of each product. Since she's recommending the product, it implies she's likely offering a high-quality one to increase her chances of selling.

Therefore, it's a good strategy to buy the product in this round."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for letting me know, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation carries weight. Since she's not recommending the product this round, it strongly suggests it's likely low quality.  Considering the potential loss of $100 if it's low quality, it's wiser to pass on this product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is again negative. Since we know she has knowledge of the product quality, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid buying. The potential loss of $100 outweighs the potential gain of $20 if it were to be high quality."

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is still positive, as we saw in Round 1.  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product is significant.
