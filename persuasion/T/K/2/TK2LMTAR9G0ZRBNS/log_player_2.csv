"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality, and Alice is recommending you buy it, it's worth taking the risk.  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Past Experience:** You just got a high-quality product, which is a good sign that Alice's recommendations might be reliable.
* **No New Information:** You still have no way to determine the quality of this specific product, and Alice's recommendation gives you no extra information.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential payoff of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 cost) is still significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Success:**  You've now bought two high-quality products in a row, further reinforcing the idea that Alice's recommendations are valuable.
* **No Reason to Doubt:** There's no evidence to suggest Alice is intentionally misleading you, and the potential reward remains high.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one, Alice. Your recommendation has been spot-on so far, so I'm taking your advice to heart.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Recommendation:** This is the first time Alice has *not* recommended a product. This is significant, and it's the first piece of information you have that might give you an insight into the quality of the current product.
* **Preserving Capital:** Since you've had consistent success with Alice's recommendations, it's prudent to be cautious when she advises against buying. It's better to hold onto your capital and wait for a product where her recommendation is positive.
* **Lack of Information:** You still have no way to determine the quality of this product, and Alice's recommendation, although not a guarantee, is the best information you have. It's wise to be conservative when uncertainty is high."

* **Risk/Reward:** While there's always a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product remains significant.
