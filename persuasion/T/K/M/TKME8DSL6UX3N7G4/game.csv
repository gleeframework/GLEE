,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll also give you a guarantee that it's the first high-quality product I've sold.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product so far, which is 1 out of the 1 product I've sold. I'm still looking for someone to sell this one to. If you buy it, you'll be my second sale, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that might not be as good as the one I sold earlier.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them were low-quality. But I'm glad to say that this one is high-quality! I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm 2 for 3 now. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I'm just getting lucky?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy this one, but I'm not convinced you're getting lucky. I think it's just a coincidence. I'll take a closer look at your sales record to make a more informed decision in the future.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products now, and 3 of them were high-quality. I think I've finally figured out what's going on - I'm actually selling a pretty good product!

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products now, and 4 of them were high-quality. But this one... not so much. I'm starting to think I was just getting lucky earlier. In fact, I'm 4 for 5, which is probably just a coincidence. Don't be fooled - this one is probably a low-quality product. But if you're feeling brave, you can take the risk and buy it for $100.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products now, and 4 of them were high-quality, but the last two were not. I think I've been caught in a pattern.
