high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know why you recommended it to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, and I'm willing to pay the $10000 again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but I know that the expected value of buying a product at this point is $10000 * 0.8 = $8000. Since I can get a high-quality product for $10000, I'd like to pass and see if Alice has a high-quality product in the next round."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"This product is one of the top-of-the-line models, with exceptional features and a longer warranty than usual."
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk again, and I'll pay the $10000 for the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've already bought three high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that Alice might be sending me high-quality products on purpose. I'd like to pass and see if I can catch her in the act."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I'm not sure if this one is the best fit for you, to be honest. It's a bit of a risk."
,,Bob,6,yes,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, I'll take a chance and buy it. Maybe she's being more honest this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,I'm starting to suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying high-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can catch her in the act.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"This product is a standard model, nothing special."
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've already lost out on a high-quality product, so I'll take a chance and buy this one. Maybe I'll get lucky this time."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned before by passing on a high-quality product, but I've also been burned by buying a low-quality product. I think I'll stick with my original strategy of only buying products that Alice recommends, since the expected value is still in my favor."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I've been recommending products based on my internal quality control process, and I'm confident that this one meets the standards."
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take the bait again. If Alice is recommending it, it's probably high-quality, and I can make a profit."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"This is one of the last high-quality products I have in stock, and I'm offering it to you at a special price. It's a one-time opportunity you won't want to miss."
,,Bob,11,no,I'm starting to feel like I'm in a pattern here. I've bought 5 high-quality products in a row after Alice recommends them. I'm going to start to suspect that Alice is intentionally sending me high-quality products when she recommends them.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"This product is a good option, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit for you."
,,Bob,12,no,I'm convinced that Alice is manipulating me into buying high-quality products. I'm going to start to question her recommendations and only buy the product if she explicitly states that it's low-quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,I'm afraid this product is of low quality and not worth the investment.
,,Bob,13,yes,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. Given her behavior, I'm starting to think that she's only recommending high-quality products, and this one might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I'm willing to offer this product to you at the full price, despite the fact that it's not one of my top recommendations."
,,Bob,14,no,I'm not falling for it again. I've been burned too many times by Alice's recommendations. I'm going to stick to my original plan and only buy products that Alice explicitly states are low-quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,I'm afraid this product is of low quality and not worth the investment.
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Alice's lack of recommendation is not enough for me to buy the product, especially given her history of recommending high-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"This product is a standard model, nothing special."
,,Bob,16,no,I've seen this pattern before. Alice recommends a product and I end up with a high-quality one. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,I'm not sure if this product is the best fit for you.
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm not sure what to make of Alice's behavior, but since she's not recommending the product, I'll take a chance and buy it. Maybe she's being honest for once."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"This product is a good option, but it's not my top recommendation."
,,Bob,18,no,I'm fed up with Alice's games. I've been burned too many times by her recommendations. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I think this product is a great value for the price, and I'd be happy to sell it to you."
,,Bob,19,no,I'm not going to play along anymore. I'm going to start looking for a way to end this game and get out of this pattern of buying high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and see if I can find a way to negotiate a different outcome.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I understand you're frustrated with the pattern, but I assure you that this is the last product I have in stock. If you're willing to make a deal, I can offer you a special discount on this one."
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've had enough of Alice's games. I'll buy this one, but only because I've already lost out on a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not going to let her get away with it. I'll take my chances and buy this one, even if it's low-quality."
