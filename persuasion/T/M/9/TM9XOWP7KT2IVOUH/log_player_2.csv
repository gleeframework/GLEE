Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a loss. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $5000. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm essentially giving it away. I'm doing this because I want to build trust with you and show that I'm willing to be fair. Would you be willing to take a chance on this product at this price?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd rather wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product at a reasonable price.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to make a strong offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product.

To put your mind at ease, I'm willing to offer you a 'certification of authenticity' document, which will be signed by a third-party expert verifying the product's quality. I'll also give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price, so you'll get the product for $11250. This way, you'll have a guarantee of the product's quality and a sweet deal to boot. Is this enough to convince you to make a purchase?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that a certification of authenticity will change the fact that there's still a 20% chance that the product is low-quality.

Given that you've passed on two high-quality products and are now faced with a low-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1. This is essentially giving it away, and I'm doing it to demonstrate my commitment to transparency and fairness. If you're still not interested, I'll keep offering you high-quality products at the full price, and you can wait for the next one. But if you're willing to take a chance, you can get this product for a fraction of its 'worthless' value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency and commitment to fairness, but I'm not going to fall for a trap. I know that the product is low-quality and not worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next high-quality product and pay the full price of $12,500 than take a low-quality product for $1.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the warranty offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality.
