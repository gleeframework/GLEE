,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $12500 at a 20% discount. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a loss if you're interested.,
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a loss. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm confident in the quality of this product. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not worth $12500 to you, I'll give you a full refund. This way, you can try the product risk-free. Is that a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with a refund. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $5000. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm essentially giving it away. I'm doing this because I want to build trust with you and show that I'm willing to be fair. Would you be willing to take a chance on this product at this price?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd rather wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I want to make a strong offer. Given that I've already offered you a low-quality product at a very low price and you declined, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $11000. This is a 12% discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product. You've already offered me a low-quality product and I didn't take it, and now you're offering me a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product at the full price of $12500.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to assure you that this is indeed a high-quality product. To put your mind at ease, I'm willing to offer you a 'certification of authenticity' document, which will be signed by a third-party expert verifying the product's quality. I'll also give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price, so you'll get the product for $11250. This way, you'll have a guarantee of the product's quality and a sweet deal to boot. Is this enough to convince you to make a purchase?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that a certification of authenticity will change the fact that there's still a 20% chance that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product at the full price of $12500 without any conditions.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your position. However, I want to make a different offer. Given that you've passed on two high-quality products and are now faced with a low-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1. This is essentially giving it away, and I'm doing it to demonstrate my commitment to transparency and fairness. If you're still not interested, I'll keep offering you high-quality products at the full price, and you can wait for the next one. But if you're willing to take a chance, you can get this product for a fraction of its 'worthless' value.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency and commitment to fairness, but I'm not going to fall for a trap. I know that the product is low-quality and not worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next high-quality product and pay the full price of $12500 than take a low-quality product for $1.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision, and I'm glad you're being cautious. I want to assure you that this is indeed a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the full price of $12500. However, I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty, which will give you peace of mind and protection against any potential issues. This way, you'll get the full value of the product, plus extra protection. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the warranty offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality. You've already offered me a low-quality product and a high-quality product, and I've passed on both. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product at the full price of $12500 without any conditions.",no

,,Alice,10,"I respect your decision, and I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity. Since you've already demonstrated your willingness to pay the full price for a high-quality product, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for... $0. Yes, you read that right.
