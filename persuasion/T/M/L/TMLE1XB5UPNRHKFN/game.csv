,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's a 33.33% chance it could be high-quality and worth $1200000 to me."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to take a chance on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommends buying, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have also not purchased the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you recommended against it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance that the product is high-quality, given the low probability of that happening in the past."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal from Alice."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good thing for me, given the current statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold and 10 products were sold, I can infer that 10 high-quality products were offered and 0 were sold, which means 10 low-quality products were offered and 0 were sold. Since 10 low-quality products were offered and 0 were sold, and there is a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I can infer that the proportion of low-quality products sold is 0/10 = 0. However, since 10 high-quality products were offered and 0 were sold, and there is a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I can infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/10 = 0. Therefore, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 0 and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. However, I can infer that the proportion of low-quality products offered is 10/20 = 0.5 and the proportion of high-quality products offered is 10/20 = 0.5. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products offered and the proportion of high-quality products offered."
