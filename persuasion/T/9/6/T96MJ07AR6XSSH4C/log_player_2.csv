Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has already sold 3 products and only 1 of them was high quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the overall probability of 80%, which is 0.8. Given that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/4, I would estimate it to be around 0.25. Therefore, I think it's more likely that this product is low quality.""}"
