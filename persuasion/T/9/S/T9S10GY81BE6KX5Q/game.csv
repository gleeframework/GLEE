,,Alice,1,"This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like any other product.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to buy the product and see its quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product has the same probability of being high-quality as the previous one, 50%, despite the previous product being low-quality, the outcome of the previous round doesn't affect this round's product quality.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not going to buy this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I've already lost $1000000 on the previous low-quality product. I'd like to see the quality of this one before making a decision.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You didn't buy the previous product and now you have the opportunity to buy this one. Remember, each product's quality is independent of the others, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 50%. Missing this product might result in missing a potential $2900000 profit ($3000000 - $100000).",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the chance and buy this product, hoping it's high-quality. The potential profit is too great to pass up.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've had one success and one failure so far, and one product's quality that was unknown to you but didn't result in a loss. Keep in mind that each product is independent of the others, so don't let your previous experiences influence your decision. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll be cautious after the previous loss, but I'll also consider the potential gain. Since the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, I'll pass on this one and see what the next product has to offer.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've been cautious with your last decision, but don't let fear of loss dictate your choices. With the probability of a product being high-quality remaining at 50%, every product offers the same potential for profit. Consider the significant profit you could make if this product is high-quality, and remember that each round is independent of the others.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take a chance and buy this product. I've been burned twice, but the potential profit is too great to pass up. I'll hope that this one is high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've had two successes and two failures, with one product's quality that was unknown to you but didn't result in a loss, and one product that was also unknown to you but now you know the quality of all the other products except that one. However, that information can't be used to infer this round's product quality. Each product is an independent event, so don't let your previous experiences cloud your judgment. The probability of this product being high-quality remains 50%.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm on a roll! I'll keep the momentum going and buy this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm feeling optimistic after the last win.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've chosen to wait for a better opportunity, but keep in mind that each product is an independent event.

Consider the potential profit and make a decision based on the probability, not on past experiences.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the chance and buy this product. The potential profit is too great to pass up, and I've been out of the game for too long. I'll hope that this one is high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've had a mix of successes and failures, but don't let that influence your decision. Each product is a new opportunity, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 50%. You've shown that you're willing to take risks for the potential profit, so consider whether that's still the right strategy for you. Make a decision based on the probability and potential gain, rather than on past outcomes.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm starting to feel like I'm just throwing money away at this point. I've been burned four times, and the potential loss is significant. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get lucky eventually.",no
