,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I have no information to go by. I'll buy it and see what happens.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I've noticed that your previous recommendation was not to buy, and there have been no high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 20%. Can you offer me a discount to make the risk more appealing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the low sales record. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not, but I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products and none were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth the $100 purchase price."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. If 3 out of 3 products were low quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the statistics.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products offered so far have been low-quality, which suggests a bias in the selection process. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
