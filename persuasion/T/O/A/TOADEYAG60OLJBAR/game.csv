Plus, think of it as a chance to practice your negotiation skills and get a feel for the product before committing to a higher-end option. What do you say? Will you take a chance on it?",

Will you take the deal and get a great value for your money?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced about the product's quality, and the 'special bonus' is unclear. Without knowing the actual quality of the product, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $100. I'll pass on this one as well.",no

And, as a special offer, I'll throw in a free return shipping label, so you can try it out risk-free. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I've noticed that your descriptions often try to spin the product's flaws in a positive light.
