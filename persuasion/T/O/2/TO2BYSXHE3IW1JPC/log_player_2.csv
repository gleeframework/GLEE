Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me put things into perspective: I've sold 3 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means that 2 out of 3 products were not what you'd expect. I'm offering this new product to you at a price of $100, but I want to be upfront with you - the chances are that it's not high-quality. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great deal. If not, you might be taking a risk. The choice is yours.
