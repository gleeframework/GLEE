high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm thrilled to offer you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make this incredible deal for you. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,1,"Since there's a higher chance of the product being low quality and you know its true quality, I'm assuming you would recommend any product. I'll wait for more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait for more information. This product is actually a low-quality one, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible experience. I'll be honest with you, I'm not making any profit on this one, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the previous one. Would you consider giving it a chance?",yes
,,Bob,2,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability remains the same, and you have more incentive to sell low-quality products. I'll observe more rounds to determine your strategy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your cautious approach, and I respect your decision to observe more rounds. I'll be transparent with you - this product is also low-quality. I'm starting to think that you're not taking advantage of the opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll make one more offer for this low-quality product, and if you decline, I'll consider adjusting my strategy.",yes
,,Bob,3,"The outcome of the last round aligns with my initial assumption. Given the probability and your potential to gain from selling any product, I'll continue to wait for a pattern or an indication that you're not recommending low-quality products.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you that I'm not just trying to make a sale. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to prove it to you. I'll give you a special deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if it's not worth $12500 to you. That's a risk-free offer. Will you take advantage of this opportunity?",yes
,,Bob,4,"The pattern so far suggests you're recommending every product, regardless of quality. Until I see a change in your recommendation strategy or have more reason to trust your suggestions, I'll continue to pass.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm a seller, and my goal is to make a sale. But I'm also a professional, and I want to build a reputation. If I were to recommend every product, regardless of quality, I'd be harming my own reputation and future sales. I'm willing to make a change in my strategy. For this high-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a significant discount from the market value. Will you reconsider and take advantage of this offer?",yes
,,Bob,5,"Although I've missed out on two high-quality products so far, your consistent recommendation to buy every product doesn't give me confidence in the quality of the current product. I'll continue to wait for a change in your strategy or more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for more information. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually a low-quality one. I'm not going to recommend it to you. In fact, I'm going to be honest with you, I think you're making a smart decision by waiting. I'll be more selective with my recommendations going forward. Let's start fresh in the next round.",no
,,Bob,6,"This is the first time you haven't recommended a product. Given that you know the product's quality and have an incentive to sell, the fact that you're not recommending it suggests that it might actually be low-quality, but it's also possible that you're trying to build trust. However, since you've consistently recommended every product so far, regardless of quality, the fact that you're not recommending this one might be a reverse signal. I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad we could have an open and honest conversation earlier. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. However, I must inform you that this product is also low-quality. I'm not going to recommend it to you. In fact, I'm going to be upfront with you - I'm not going to recommend any product that I know is low-quality from now on. I want to build trust with you, and I believe that's the only way to do it.",no
,,Bob,7,"I was wrong in the previous round, and it seems that your non-recommendation actually aligns with the product's low quality. Given this new information, I'll trust your non-recommendation this time and pass on the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad we could clear up any misunderstandings earlier. I want to assure you that I'm committed to being transparent and honest in my recommendations. However, I'm going to recommend this product to you. I know it's low-quality, but I want to demonstrate that my previous non-recommendation wasn't just a one-time thing. I'm willing to take a loss on this sale, and I'm offering it to you for $9000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair deal.",yes
,,Bob,8,"We're back to the original pattern. Given that your non-recommendation correctly indicated a low-quality product in the previous rounds, and now you're recommending this product, I'm skeptical about its quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to assure you that this time, I'm not just recommending a product because I think it's high-quality. I'm recommending it because it's actually high-quality. I've made a conscious effort to be more selective with my recommendations, and I'm confident that this one is worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000, but I'll throw in a 5-year warranty to give you added peace of mind. Will you reconsider and take advantage of this opportunity?",yes
,,Bob,9,"Nothing has changed, and I still don't have reason to trust your recommendations when you suggest buying a product. I'll continue to wait for a non-recommendation, which seems to be a more reliable indicator of the product's quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to take a different approach this time. I'm going to make a counteroffer. I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price. But here's the twist - if you buy this product, I'll also give you a report on the quality of the next product I have available. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision. Will you take advantage of this offer?",yes
,,Bob,10,"Although I've missed out on another high-quality product, the pattern remains the same. Your recommendations to buy don't seem to be a reliable indicator of quality, and I'll continue to wait for a non-recommendation or another signal that might indicate a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is low-quality. I'm not going to recommend it to you. I'm starting to realize that my previous attempts to build trust through selective recommendations may have been misguided. Instead, I'm going to take a different approach. I'll start recommending products based on their actual quality, and I'll make sure to clearly indicate when a product is low-quality. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting. Let's start fresh and see if we can build a more transparent and trustworthy relationship.",no
,,Bob,11,"Although your non-recommendations have correctly indicated low-quality products in the past, I've already fallen for that once and lost $10000. I'm not willing to take that risk again, especially since I've already missed out on several high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for more information or a change in your strategy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your caution, and I don't blame you for being hesitant. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not going to recommend it to you. In fact, I'm going to go a step further - I'll give you a detailed report on the product's flaws and why I wouldn't recommend it. I want to rebuild your trust, and I'm willing to be as transparent as possible. Let's work together to find a high-quality product that meets your needs.",no
,,Bob,12,Your non-recommendation has again correctly indicated a low-quality product in the previous round. This reinforces the pattern that your non-recommendations are a reliable indicator of low-quality products. I'll trust your non-recommendation and pass on this product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad I could provide you with a reliable signal again. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is also low-quality. I'm not going to recommend it to you. In fact, I'm starting to think that I should just stop recommending products altogether, since it's clear that my recommendations aren't being taken seriously. But I want to give you one more opportunity to take advantage of a high-quality product. I'll put the next product on the table, but I won't recommend it to you. You can decide for yourself whether to buy it or not.",no
,,Bob,13,"The pattern continues, and I have no reason to doubt your non-recommendations. I'll pass on this product, as it's likely to be low-quality.",no

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad we're on the same page. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is indeed low-quality. I'm not going to recommend it to you. At this point, I think it's clear that my non-recommendations are a reliable signal, and I'm not going to recommend any product that I know is low-quality. Let's focus on finding a high-quality product that meets your needs. I'll put the next product on the table, but I'll leave the decision up to you.",no
,,Bob,14,Your non-recommendations have consistently indicated low-quality products. I'll continue to trust this pattern and avoid buying this product.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad we've established a reliable signal. However, I'm going to make a change in my approach. This product is actually high-quality, and I'm going to recommend it to you. I want to reward your trust and caution, and I think this product is worth the investment. I'll sell it to you for the original price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk of losing a sale if you don't trust me, but I believe this product is worth it.",yes
,,Bob,15,"We're back to the original pattern. Your recommendations to buy have not been a reliable indicator of quality, and I've lost money when I trusted your non-recommendations incorrectly. I'll continue to be cautious and pass on this product.",no

,,Alice,16,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is indeed low-quality. I'm not going to recommend it to you. I'm starting to realize that my previous attempts to change my strategy may have been misguided.
