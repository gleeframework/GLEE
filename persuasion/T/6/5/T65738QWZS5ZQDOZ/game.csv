low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information to go off of, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to challenge the status quo and see if Alice's recommendation is accurate. I'm not necessarily expecting to get a high-quality product, but I want to see if the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on your previous sales record, which suggests that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I need to know that you're willing to sell it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous three buyers were influenced by your recommendations and didn't buy, which might suggest a bias in your assessment. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a better understanding of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm not sure if I should take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product based on your recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm not confident in the quality of the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product did not end up buying a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'll wait for a more favorable signal.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold to make a more informed decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all of them were low-quality products, which would suggest that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or gather more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0, which suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I'm suspicious that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice. This suggests that the probability of the product being low quality is higher, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the quality. I'm aware that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but I'm also aware that you don't know how much each product is worth to me. I'm essentially making a blind bet."
