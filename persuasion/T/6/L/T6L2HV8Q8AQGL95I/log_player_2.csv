Alice's message: I've sold 4 products so far, and 2 of them have been high-quality. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and considering the ratio of high-quality products I've sold so far (2/4 = 50%), it's likely that the actual probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd say the probability is around 25%. You might want to think twice about the value of this product at $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 products so far, and 3 of them have been high-quality. I think this is a good opportunity to correct my previous message. With a higher sample size, the ratio of high-quality products is now 3/5 = 60%, which is actually higher than the expected probability of 33.33%. This suggests that I might be selling more high-quality products than expected. You might want to take advantage of this trend and buy this high-quality product for $100!

Alice's message: I've sold 6 products so far, and 4 of them have been high-quality. Unfortunately, it looks like the trend has reversed, and this product is not high-quality. I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6, which is actually lower than the expected probability of 33.33%. It's possible that I've just gotten lucky with the first 3 high-quality products, and the actual probability is still 33.33%. You might want to think carefully before buying at $100.
