,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and there's a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this round to gather more information for future rounds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend the product and considering the high probability of it being low quality, I will not take the risk and pass on this round."
