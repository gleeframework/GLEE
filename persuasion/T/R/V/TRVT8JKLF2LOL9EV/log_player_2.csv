**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products (5/5). This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which, considering her knowledge of the product's quality, implies a high probability of it being high-quality.
* **Potential Upside:** Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit of $20 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 from a low-quality product.

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the evidence suggests a high probability of it being high quality, making the purchase a calculated risk with potential for significant reward."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The previous sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying it.  This strongly suggests the product is high quality.

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, the available data suggests that Alice is being truthful and likely has a high-quality product. The potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of $0 loss."
