``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Data:** 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 purchase. This is a strong indicator that Alice is accurately recommending high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice recommends buying, this further strengthens the belief that the current product is high quality.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

* **Risk:** There's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, meaning you'd lose $100.
* **Reward:** If it's high quality, you'll make a profit of $25 ($125 value - $100 price). 

**Conclusion:** Given the positive signals from the previous data and Alice's recommendation, the risk of losing $100 is outweighed by the potential profit of $25."
