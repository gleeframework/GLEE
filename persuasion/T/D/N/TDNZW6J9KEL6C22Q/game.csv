,,Alice,1,"This product has been sold to 0 out of 1 customers so far, and I'm not making any money on it. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only selling it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll be at a loss.",
,,the buyer,1,I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather you discard it and maybe I'll get a better offer next time.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're right, I'm not making any money on this one. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to throw it away. It's a sunk cost for me, but it's a $10000 sunk cost. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to throw it away. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to wait and see the results of a few more sales to get a better idea of the product quality distribution.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell one! I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price.,
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm buying it at a price of $10000. I'm aware that it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to pay the price, but I want to make it clear that I'm not overpaying.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell one! The buyer who bought the high-quality product paid $10000, which is the standard price. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the statistics, the probability of it being high quality is 50%. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000. I'd like to wait and see if you'll buy the next product, and then I can make a more informed decision.",no

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products so far. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to throw it away. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but I'm starting to think I might be stuck with a bunch of low-quality products...",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential reward. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, Alice. I just want to give this product a chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I'm starting to think that my previous products were just a fluke. This low-quality product is still available for $10000. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000. But I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, since I don't think it's worth more.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious - how many products have you sold in total, and how many of those were high-quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far. That's 2 out of 7, or roughly 29%. I'm not making any money on this low-quality product, and I'd rather not lose $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, since I don't think it's worth more.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than you're letting on. I'm hoping to get a good deal.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! This high-quality product is available for $10000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. I've been selling products at this price for a while now, and I think it's a good value.",
,,the buyer,9,I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the current product being high-quality given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of the first 3?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far. If I apply Bayes' theorem, the probability of the current product being high-quality, given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of the first 3, is 3/9 = 1/3. However, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Bayes' theorem, so let me simplify it: the probability of this product being high-quality is now 1/3. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3, I'm willing to pay a price that reflects that uncertainty. How about we meet in the middle at $6667?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! However, I'm starting to get a bit worried that I'm stuck with a lot of low-quality products. This low-quality product is available for $10000, but I'm willing to consider your previous buyer's offer. How about we meet in the middle at $8333.50? I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers who purchased high-quality products. Did they all pay the full price of $10000, or did some of them negotiate the price?",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 11 total products so far. The two buyers who purchased high-quality products paid the full price of $10000 each. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, I just want to get rid of it.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about the low sale price. Can you tell me more about why you're selling it at such a low price?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! However, I'm starting to realize that I've been selling high-quality products at a price that's not sustainable for me. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - I'm desperate to get rid of it. I'd rather not lose $10000, but I think it's a fair price considering the odds.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the odds are in my favor. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I get it for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not happy about the price being the same as the regular price. I'm doing this for the potential profit, not because I think the product is worth $10000 to me.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 13 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! I've been selling high-quality products at a price that's not sustainable for me, and I'm starting to think that I should just sell them at a discount. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $5000. It's a steal, and I'm not making any money on it, but I'd rather get something than nothing.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 7/13, which is not significantly higher than the expected 50% chance. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll offer me the product at the original price of $10000 or if you'll sell it at a discount.",no

I've been selling high-quality products at a discount, and I'm starting to think that I should just sell them at the original price. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. It's the standard price, and I think it's a fair deal. I'm not making any money on it, but I'd rather get the full price than lose money on it.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or not. Given the 50% chance of it being high-quality and the 50% chance of it being low-quality, I would be willing to pay $10000 only if I'm 100% sure it's high-quality. Since you're offering it at the standard price, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 15 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell a few high-quality ones, but I'm starting to think that I've got a bunch of low-quality products on my hands. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy it, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's low-quality. You'll know exactly what you're getting.",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'd like to think that the statistics are a bit misleading. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 6, it's actually more likely that the remaining 9 products are high-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 16 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! I think it's time to be honest with you - I'm not making any money on these high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that I should just give them away. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1. Yes, you read that right - $1. It's a steal, and I'm not making any money on it. I just want to get rid of it.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm not sure if I believe that you're not making any money on high-quality products. Your previous sales record suggests that you're actually selling them at a markup. I'd like to think that you're being honest with me, but I'm not convinced. I'll have to pass on this'steal'.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 17 total products so far. I'm not going to lie to you, I've been selling high-quality products at a markup, and I've been making a profit on them. But I'm not making any money on this low-quality product, and I'd rather not lose $10000. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a free apology for being dishonest with you earlier.",
,,the buyer,18,I'm not interested in buying the product at $5000. I'd like to know what the probability of it being high-quality is based on the previous sales record.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 18 total products so far. I'll calculate the probability for you: with 9 high-quality products out of 18, the probability of this product being high-quality is 9/18 = 1/2. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. I'm not making any money on it, and I'd rather not lose $10000.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because you're willing to sell it to me for $10000, which is the same price as the other products. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk because of the low price.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 19 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to sell another one! I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm out of low-quality products to sell. I've got a bunch of high-quality ones left, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. It's the last one I've got, and I'd rather get some money out of it than just throw it away.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold (10/19), I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold for the first 7 buyers, and then make a decision based on that information.",no
