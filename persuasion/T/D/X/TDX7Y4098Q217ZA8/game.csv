low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low quality. Given the high probability of a product being low quality (66.67%) and the fact that all previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the value of this product. I'd like to pass on it."

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a buyer who purchased a product after a recommendation to sell a high-quality product, so I can get a better understanding of the probability of a high-quality product being sold after a recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the products you've recommended so far are likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product.

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation from Alice before making a purchase."
