I'm willing to make a deal on this one, and I'm confident you won't regret it.""

"Bob's message: I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality item, but the potential upside of getting a high-quality item for $10000 is too good to pass up.

However, I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, which is essentially what I'd pay for it myself.
