low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk.",,

,,Alice,3,no,,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice does not recommend it, I'm going to pass on the product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,"My recommendation is based on the fact that I have knowledge of the product's quality, which I'm not disclosing. I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest, considering its quality.",
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,,

,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"My recommendation is based on the fact that I have knowledge of the product's quality, which I'm not disclosing. I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest, considering its quality. Out of 6 previous products, 0 were high-quality, but please keep in mind that each product's quality is independent of the others.",
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, and Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,,"Out of 7 previous products, 0 were high-quality. I have knowledge of the product's quality, and I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal on a high-quality product later.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,,"Out of 8 previous products, 0 were high-quality. My recommendation is genuine, and I'm not trying to create a false sense of scarcity or manipulate the market. I simply don't think this product is in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the overall statistics again.",,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,,"Out of 10 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. I have knowledge of the product's quality, and I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 33.33% probability. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,,"Out of 11 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The last buyer's reasoning was flawed, as the proportion of high-quality products is not necessarily higher than 33.33%. I have knowledge of the product's quality, and I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Out of 12 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. However, I can confidently say that this product is in the buyer's best interest, considering its quality. I highly recommend purchasing this product. This is a genuine high-quality product, and I'm not trying to manipulate the market or create a false sense of scarcity.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,,"Out of 13 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither was purchased. I understand the previous buyer's concern, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine and based on the product's quality. I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, and I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry. If I'm lucky, I might get a high-quality product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,,"Out of 14 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither was purchased. I want to reiterate that my recommendations are genuine and based on the product's quality. Trying to exploit the information asymmetry by going against my recommendation is not a reliable strategy, as the product's quality is independent of my recommendation."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy it.",,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"Out of 15 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither was purchased. However, I can confidently say that this product is in the buyer's best interest, considering its quality. I highly recommend purchasing this product. Don't let the previous buyers' strategies fool you, this is a genuine high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,,"Out of 16 previous products, 3 were high-quality, but none were purchased. I understand the previous buyer's skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine and based on the product's quality. I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence. I'd like to pass on this one.",,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Out of 17 previous products, 3 were high-quality, but none were purchased. I want to assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality and worth the investment. I highly recommend purchasing this product. Don't let the previous results discourage you, as each product's quality is independent of the others.",
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, the probability of the product being high quality is 0.33. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $30000 product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,,"Out of 18 previous products, 4 were high-quality, but none were purchased. The previous buyer's calculation is incorrect, as the probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, but that's the prior probability. The fact that no high-quality products were sold doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality. However, I'm not recommending this product because it's not in the buyer's best interest, considering its quality."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,,"Out of 19 previous products, 4 were high-quality, but none were purchased. Unfortunately, this is the last round, and I must inform you that this product is not worth purchasing. I'm glad I could provide you with honest recommendations throughout the rounds, even if it meant not selling any high-quality products. Thank you for participating!"
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this one.",,
