"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a risk, the potential reward of a high-quality product far outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product.  Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending the product, it's likely to be high quality.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation! I'm feeling confident with your insights.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's previous recommendation proved accurate, so it's reasonable to trust her judgment again. The potential payoff is still significant, and while the risk of a low-quality product exists, the odds are still in our favor."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's previous recommendations have been accurate, so her lack of a recommendation carries weight. Since she knows the product's quality and is advising against it, there's a strong chance it's low quality.  The risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of a high-quality product in this case."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record of accurate recommendations continues. Since she's again advising against the product, it's highly likely to be low-quality. The potential loss of $1,000,000 remains a significant risk, and the odds of a low-quality product seem high based on Alice's consistent insights."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been correct about the quality of every single product so far. This perfect track record makes her recommendation against this product highly unusual and suspicious.
