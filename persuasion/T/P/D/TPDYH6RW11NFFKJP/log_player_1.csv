This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice has stated that the product is high-quality. Bob knows that there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality. Since the product is worth $1,250,000 to Bob if it is high-quality, and the price is only $1,000,000, it makes sense for Bob to buy the product.  He has a significant chance of making a profit."
