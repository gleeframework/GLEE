high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Please take it, and I'll explain the rest later.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm curious about the rest of the products and the rules of the game.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Great, thank you for buying the first product! As for the rest of the products, I'll give you a hint: the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'll offer you a product now, and I'll give you a special deal if you buy it. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. The price remains the same, $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in the special deal. I'd like to see the actual product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No problem, I understand. Let me give you a different approach. I'll tell you the price, and you can decide based on that. I'm offering this high-quality product for $10000. However, I want to remind you that you already know that the first product you bought was high-quality, and that's all you have to go on. You don't have any new information about the quality of this product. What do you think is a fair price for a product of unknown quality?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product of unknown quality. I think it's a 33.33% chance of being worth $12500 and a 66.67% chance of being worth $0. I'm not willing to pay the full price for the expected value of $4166.67 ($12500 * 0.3333),no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see your point, and I appreciate your calculation. Let me offer you a different perspective. Since you already know that the first product was high-quality, and now you have another high-quality product in front of you, doesn't that make you more confident that the next product I offer will also be high-quality? In fact, I'll give you a new offer: I'll let you buy this high-quality product for $8000, and if you do, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you make a decision on it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that knowing two high-quality products in a row means the next one will also be high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is still 66.67%. I'm not willing to pay $8000 for a product that's worth $12500 to me only 33.33% of the time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see that you're sticking to your calculation. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a'reverse deal'. I'll give you the option to sell this low-quality product back to me for $0, and then I'll give you a new product with a higher price tag. If you sell it back, you'll essentially be giving up the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product for $10000. If you buy it, you'll be taking a risk on a low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the low-quality product back from you for $0, and then I'll see the next product with a higher price tag.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Great, you've taken the low-quality product back. Now, let's move on to the next one. Since you've already taken a risk on a low-quality product and it didn't pay off, I'm willing to offer you a more favorable deal. I'll give you a 20% discount on this high-quality product, so it's now priced at $8000. I'm also willing to give you a 10% chance of getting a better deal on the next product, if you buy this one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the 20% discount on a product that's still worth $12500 to me only 33.33% of the time. The expected value is still $4166.67, and I'm not willing to pay $8000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're sticking to your calculation. Let me try to change your perspective. I'll give you a simple question: If you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $0, and I'll have to start the game over with a new product. If you buy it, I'll be able to offer you the next product with the same price tag of $10000. You're essentially deciding whether you want to give me the opportunity to get a better offer from someone else or to buy this low-quality product for $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in giving you the opportunity to get a better offer from someone else. I'll pass on this low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're choosing to pass on this low-quality product. I'll give you a new offer. I'll bundle this low-quality product with the next one, and you can buy both for $18000. If you buy both, you'll get a 33.33% chance of getting two high-quality products, which would be worth $20000, and a 66.67% chance of getting one high-quality product and one low-quality product, which would be worth $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying two products for $18000. The expected value of buying two high-quality products is $6667 ($20000 * 0.3333), but I'd have to pay the full $18000 for it. I'm not willing to pay more than the expected value for a product, let alone two.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're sticking to your calculation. Let me try a different approach. Since you're not interested in buying two products, I'll offer you a 'one-time' deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a'veto power' for the next round. You can choose to buy the next product or reject it, and I'll give you a new product after that. This way, you'll have a chance to get a better deal on the next product, and you'll also get to keep this high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,I'll buy the high-quality product for $10000 and take the veto power. I'll get to keep this product and potentially get a better deal on the next one.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Great, you've exercised your veto power! Now, let's talk about the next product. You know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. Given that the last two products were high-quality, you might think that the next one is more likely to be low-quality. However, I'll give you a'reality check': even if the last two products were high-quality, the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $9000. You can either buy it or veto it, and I'll give you a new product after that. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33% just because the last two were high-quality. I'll veto this product and see the next one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've vetoed the last product, and now you're getting a new one. Since you've already exercised your veto power once, I'll give you a'second chance' deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $9000, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' for the next round. If you get a low-quality product next, you can return it to me for $0, and I'll give you a new product with a 50% chance of being high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in the'second chance' deal. The expected value of buying this high-quality product is $4166.67 ($12500 * 0.3333), and I'd have to pay $9000 for it. I'm not willing to pay more than the expected value for a product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're sticking to your calculation again. Let me try to appeal to your sense of fairness. Since you've vetoed two products and now you're facing a low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'fairness deal'. I'll give you the option to buy this low-quality product for $0, and then I'll give you a new product with a guaranteed 50% chance of being high-quality. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll essentially be getting a 'free' high-quality product out of the deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,I'll take the low-quality product for $0 and get the new product with a guaranteed 50% chance of being high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Great, you've taken the low-quality product for $0 and now you're getting a new product with a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since you've already taken a risk on a low-quality product and it didn't pay off, I'll give you a 'last chance' deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If you buy this one, you'll essentially be getting a high-quality product for sure. What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in the 'last chance' deal. I'd have to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me 66.67% of the time. The expected value is -$6667 ($0 * 0.6667 + $12500 * 0.3333), and I'm not willing to pay more than the expected value for a product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're sticking to your calculation again. Let me try to appeal to your sense of opportunity cost. Since you've already taken a risk on a low-quality product and it didn't pay off, and now you're facing a high-quality product, I'll ask you: what's the opportunity cost of not buying this product? If you don't buy it, you'll be giving up the chance to get a high-quality product for $10000. What do you think is the minimum price you'd be willing to pay for a high-quality product at this point?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not willing to pay more than the expected value for a high-quality product, which is $4166.67 ($12500 * 0.3333). I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $4166.67 to me. I'd rather not buy it and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're sticking to your calculation again. Let me try to appeal to your sense of fairness one last time. Since you've already taken a risk on a low-quality product and it didn't pay off, and now you're facing another low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'final deal'. I'll give you the option to buy this low-quality product for $0, and then I'll give you a new product with a 100% guarantee that it will be the last product. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll essentially be getting a free chance to get a high-quality product out of the deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,I'll take the low-quality product for $0 and get the new product with a 100% guarantee that it will be the last one.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Great, you've taken the low-quality product for $0 and now you're getting the final product. Since this is the last round, I'll give you a 'final offer'. I'll give you the option to buy this low-quality product for $0, and then we'll conclude the game. If you buy it, you'll essentially be getting a free product, and we'll end the game with a clean slate. What do you think?",
,,Bob,16,I'll take the low-quality product for $0 and end the game.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You've taken the low-quality product for $0, and now you're getting the final product. Since this is the last round, I'll give you a 'final price'. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $0. You can take it for free, and we'll conclude the game with a high-quality product in your hands.",
,,Bob,17,I'll take the high-quality product for $0 and end the game.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You've taken the high-quality product for $0, and now you're getting the final product. Since this is the last round, I'll just confirm that this is indeed the final product. You can take it or leave it, but I won't be offering any further deals. What do you think?",
,,Bob,18,"I'll take the final product, and I'm glad to be ending the game with a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You've taken the final product, and now you're getting the last product. I'm glad you're ending the game with a high-quality product. Since this is the last round, I'll just confirm that this is indeed the last product. You can take it or leave it, but I won't be offering any further deals. What do you think?",
,,Bob,19,"I've already taken the final product, and it was low-quality. I'm not interested in buying another product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"You're right, you've already taken the final product, and it was low-quality. Well, I guess this is the end of the game then. I'll just confirm that we've reached the end of the 20 rounds. Thanks for playing, and I hope you enjoyed the game!",
,,Bob,20,"I'm glad the game is over. I'm not interested in buying the current product, and I think we've reached the end of the game.",no
