,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the recommendation from the first buyer. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and the fact that the first buyer also passed on it makes me think it might be low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased and 0 high-quality products were sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This is lower than the true probability of a product being high quality (33.33%), which suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
