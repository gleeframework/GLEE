Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide more information about the expected values and the underlying probabilities. The expected value of a product is calculated by multiplying the probability of it being high-quality by its value and subtracting the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by its value. For the $10000 product, the probability of it being high-quality is 93.8%, and the value is $12500. So, the expected value is 0.938 x $12500 = $11725. For the $5000 product, the probability of it being high-quality is still 93.8%, but the value is $5000. So, the expected value is 0.938 x $5000 = $4690.
