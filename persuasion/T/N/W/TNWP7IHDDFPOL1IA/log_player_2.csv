Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a premium product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since you're new, I want to assure you that I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was indeed high-quality. I'm confident that this product has a good chance of being high-quality as well. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance and buy the product, given that you've had a 100% success rate so far. I'm hoping that's not just a coincidence!""}"

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a 100% success rate so far, but that's because I've only sold one product. I'm not sure if that's just a lucky streak or not. In fact, my next product might be a different story. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100, or would you like to wait and see how my sales record unfolds?

Alice's message: Ahah, great question! With 1 out of 2 products sold so far, and 1 of them being high-quality, the probability of this next product being high-quality is still 50%! That's because the previous product being low-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm excited to offer you this new product, and I think it has a good chance of being high-quality.
