low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm not sure what the next one will be, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. You can make an educated guess about the quality, but I'm not giving away any more information than that. The price is still $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality, but I'm also aware that the previous product was low-quality. I'll take a calculated risk.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000.

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 out of 4 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The other 2 were low-quality. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000. I want to be transparent with you, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm starting to think that my previous low-quality products might be a fluke. Maybe I've got a streak of bad luck. Will you take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price a bit. Considering the previous low-quality products, I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll only pay $1000.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a savvy negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price. I'll stick to the original $10000. But I'll give you some additional information: I've sold 4 out of 5 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to warn you: I've been on a hot streak, and it's only a matter of time before I sell a low-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 out of 8 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality. I know what you're thinking - 'Alice is a high-quality product seller!' But don't be fooled. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll be honest with you - I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a correction.

I mean, I'm a 50/50 seller, but it's starting to look like I'm on a 5/4 streak. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to deceive you - I'm just stating the facts. This product is still a 50% chance of being high-quality. But I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting a little too good at selling high-quality products... Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced that the product is still a 50% chance of being high-quality. With 5 high-quality products out of 8 sold, it seems like you might be biasing the selection in favor of high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for a more balanced selection.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took me up on my offer! Unfortunately, I have to admit that I was wrong about the product being high-quality. It's low-quality, just like the last one. Don't worry, I'm a man of my word - I'll give you the special deal on the next product. But for now, I want to remind you that I've sold 9 out of 10 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality.

,,the buyer,13,I'm not convinced by your argument. The fact that you've sold 6 high-quality products out of 11 doesn't necessarily mean you're due for another high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I see you're a skeptical buyer, and I respect that. You're right, the law of averages doesn't always apply in this case. I've sold 12 out of 13 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. I'm not going to try to convince you that I'm due for a high-quality product.
