,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm doing this to set a baseline for the probability of a high-quality product being sold."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a different experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by the low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm not sure about your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy it anyway. I know it's a 33.33% chance of being high quality, and I'd love to get it at the fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll take the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. Therefore, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product, hoping that the next buyer will be willing to take it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold so far were low quality. I'm skeptical of the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation? Is it based on the product's quality or the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm a risk-taker and I think there's a good chance it might be high quality. I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 5 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. I'd like to see the number of products sold, the number of high-quality products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
