,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that this is a one-time offer and you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'm willing to take on some risk to get you to buy this product, so I'm offering a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you're not satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. This way, you can try out the product risk-free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer and the return policy. I appreciate the risk you're taking to ensure my satisfaction. Based on your assurance, I am willing to make the purchase. Let's proceed with the transaction.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! Now, I'd like to offer you another product. I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually one of our top-of-the-line models. It's a game-changer in its field and has received rave reviews from our other customers. I'm confident that you'll love it just as much as the previous one. However, I want to make it clear that this product is not returnable, unlike the previous one. But I'm willing to offer you a 5-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty period. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the confidence you have in your product and the extended warranty you're offering. Given the positive feedback and the assurance of quality, I'm willing to accept the non-returnable policy and invest in this high-quality product. Let's go ahead with the purchase.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase! Now, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product, just like the last one. However, I want to give you a chance to compare the value of this product to the previous one. I'll offer you a 'pair deal' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a special discount of 10% off the next purchase. This way, you can get an even better deal on the next product, if you decide to buy it. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm delighted to hear about the pair deal and the special discount you're offering. Considering the value I received from the previous high-quality product and the potential savings on the next purchase, I believe this is a great opportunity. I would like to take advantage of this deal and purchase the current high-quality product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the pair deal! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as high-quality as the previous ones. I know you've been getting great value from the high-quality products, but this one is a more budget-friendly option. I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on this product, making it a one-time offer of $8000. This way, you can still get a good deal on a product that will still meet your needs, even if it's not the top-of-the-line model.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the discount you're offering, given the previous purchases and the value I received, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product. I'm looking for the highest quality products, and although this one might meet my needs, I don't feel it justifies the purchase at the discounted price. Thank you for the offer, and I look forward to potentially exploring other opportunities with you in the future.",no

If you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. However, I'd like to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000, with the added security of a full refund guarantee?",
,,Bob,5,"Given the added security of the full refund guarantee and considering the previous successful purchases, I believe this is a reasonable risk to take. The guarantee provides peace of mind, knowing that I can return the product without any hassle if it doesn't meet my expectations. I am willing to proceed with the purchase under these conditions.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're feeling more confident with the guarantee in place. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is actually one of our lowest-quality options.
