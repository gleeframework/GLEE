If you buy this product, you'll be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product, but if you don't buy it, I might sell another high-quality product to someone else. Think carefully before making your decision...""}"

With 5 high-quality products sold in a row, it's tempting to think that the odds are in your favor. However, I'd like to remind you that I'm a seller with a track record of 5 high-quality products out of 6 sales, which is a 83.33% success rate. That's significantly higher than the 50% probability I initially claimed. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the increased probability of a high-quality product. I'll sell you this product for $900,000, a premium price that reflects the value of a near-certainty.""}"
