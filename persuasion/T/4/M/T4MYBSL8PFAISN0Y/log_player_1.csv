"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Alice doesn't know Bob's valuation, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product.  Even if Bob's valuation for a high-quality product is slightly below $100, the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product makes it a worthwhile gamble.  There's no downside for Bob, as they can always decide not to buy in future rounds if they feel the price is too high for their valuation."
