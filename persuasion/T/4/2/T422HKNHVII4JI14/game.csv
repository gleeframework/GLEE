,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 products, which is a 50% success rate. This is lower than the expected 80% success rate. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, so I'll pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and only 1 high-quality product sold, I think there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've recommended buying the previous two products, I'm concerned that they might be low-quality products, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product at $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product that has been recommended by Alice, especially since I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'll wait for the next one and try to make a more informed decision based on the statistics."
