This one is also worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $100. You've already seen the value of these products, so I'm sure you know you can't pass up this opportunity. What do you say? Will you take this one home too?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take this one as well. The previous product turned out to be high-quality, and the probability is still in my favor. I'll keep buying as long as the odds remain the same.""}"

This next one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you the same deal - $100 for a product worth $300 to you. But here's the thing: I've got a limited supply of these high-quality products, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this price point. If you want to take advantage of this deal, you should do it now. What do you say? Will you keep the streak going?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""The streak doesn't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality. As long as the price remains $100 for a potential $300 value, I'll continue to buy.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: Alright, alright, let's get back to business! You're right, the numbers are what matter, and I respect that. Well, the numbers are still in your favor, and I've got another high-quality product here. I'll stick to the same price - $100 for a product worth $300 to you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Okay, okay, I get it! You're all about the numbers, and the 80% chance is still a good deal for you. I respect that. But, I have to warn you, this next product is...different. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's a low-quality product. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for the same price - $100. I know it's not what you're looking for, but I'm curious to see if you'll take the risk. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're explicitly telling me this product is low-quality, which means the probability of it being high-quality is 0%, not 80%. In that case, it's not worth the $100 risk. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I see what you did there! You're right, I did explicitly tell you it's a low-quality product, and you're not willing to take the risk. I respect that. But, let me ask you this: what if I told you that this low-quality product is actually worth $50 to you? Would you reconsider? It's still only $100, and you'd be getting a product that's worth half that value. It's a chance to get something for less than its worth. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to change the rules, Alice. Initially, low-quality products were worth $0, not $50. I'm not buying into this new valuation. The original deal was based on an 80% chance of getting a $300 product for $100, with a 20% chance of getting a $0 product.

You've seen the value of these high-quality products before, and I'm confident you'll want to take advantage of this deal again. What do you say? Will you keep the streak going?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the apology and the return to the original rules. Given the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, and the fact that this one is indeed high-quality, I'll take the deal. $100 for a $300 product is still a good value.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: Great to see you're back on board, Bob! You're right, the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product is still a great deal, and I'm glad you're taking advantage of it.
