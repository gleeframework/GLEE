This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $100. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so based on the uncertainty of the product's quality and the fact that it's my first time buying from you. I hope you understand my caution and appreciate your honesty in sharing the statistics.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to have another customer interested in my products. I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm happy to report that it was a high-quality one. That's a 100% success rate, and I'm confident that the next product will be just as good. This one is also a premium item, worth $200 to many of my customers, and I'm offering it to you for the same discounted price of $100. Take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a steal!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your 100% success rate. It's just one data point, and I'd like to see a more diverse sample size before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your skepticism! You're right, one data point isn't enough to make a conclusion. That's why I'm happy to share with you that I've sold a total of 2 products now, and the first one was indeed high-quality. However, I've also had a chance to reflect on my business and I'd like to be transparent about the fact that I've had a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product all along. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. With that said, I'm still offering this product to you for $100, which is a steal considering the potential value of $200. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given that you've sold one high-quality product out of two, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50%, and I'm willing to pay $100 for the potential reward.",yes

I'm confident that my business is on the right track, and I'm offering you this next product with the same value proposition: a premium item worth $200 to many of my customers, available to you for just $100. Take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a steal!",

That's a 50% success rate, which is back to the initial probability. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. Considering this, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $100, but I want to give you a heads-up that it's a bit of a gamble. If you're feeling lucky, I'd be happy to sell it to you.",

I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like I might be having a bit of a streak of low-quality products. I'm still offering you this next product for $100, but I want to give you a clear warning: it's a riskier bet than usual.",
