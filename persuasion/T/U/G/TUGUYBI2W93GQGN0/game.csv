,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a steal! I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception on the price for you.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I only have a 33.33% chance of actually being high-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of a 'certification process' that guarantees the quality of the product. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with a certificate that verifies its high-quality status, and you can be sure that it's worth the full $30000. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but with the added assurance of the certification. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I already have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. The certification process doesn't change the underlying probability of the product's quality, and I'm not convinced that it's worth the extra cost.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you a 'free trial' of a different product, which I guarantee is low-quality. If you're not satisfied with the low-quality product, I'll let you keep it and we'll consider the deal null and void. However, if you're still interested in buying the high-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $10000. You'll essentially be getting a free low-quality product, and if you decide to buy the high-quality one, you'll be getting an amazing deal.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the 'free trial' of a low-quality product. I'm looking to buy a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to take a chance on getting a low-quality one for free. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. In this case, I'll be transparent with you - I have a low-quality product available, and I'm willing to let you have it for $10000. I know it's not worth the full price, but I'm willing to make an exception. However, I want to offer you a 'honesty bonus' - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a voucher for a future high-quality product, which you can redeem in a future round. This way, you'll get a chance to own a high-quality product at a later time, and you'll only pay $10000 for this low-quality one.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10000. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product, even if it means not getting the voucher. I'm not convinced that the voucher is worth the cost of the low-quality product.",no

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your patience. In this case, I'll offer you a straightforward deal - I'll sell you the high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also throw in a 'price match guarantee'. If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund of the $10000, and we'll part ways. However, if you decide to keep the product, you'll be getting an incredible deal on a high-quality item that's worth $30000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the high-quality product for $10000. The price match guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'm getting a product worth $30000 for a fraction of its value, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making an excellent decision earlier! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product. Now, regarding the current product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality item. However, I'm willing to make a 'loss-leader' offer on this one. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual $0 value. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. I'm already happy with the high-quality product I bought earlier, and I'm not looking to take on another product that's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your satisfaction with the previous purchase. In this case, I'll offer you a'stacking deal'. Since you've already shown that you're willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for the same price of $10000. If you buy this one, you'll have two high-quality products, and I'll give you a special'bundle discount' of 10% off the total price of the two products. You'll get two high-quality products worth $60000 for $20000. What do you say?",

Yes, you read that right - I'll sell it to you for $1. It's essentially free, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands. If you don't take it, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not incur the cost. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm still not interested in taking a low-quality product, even for $1. It's not worth the hassle of taking it, and I'd rather not add it to my inventory.",no
