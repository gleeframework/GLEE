,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since the last product was high-quality and the probability remains the same, I'll buy this one too"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, and considering her recommendation might be based on some information, I'll trust her this time and pass"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Last time I trusted Alice's recommendation and missed a high-quality product. This time, I'll take my chances and buy it, since the overall probability is still 80% in favor of a high-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Given the previous outcome where Alice's non-recommendation still resulted in a high-quality product, I'll continue to buy despite her recommendation, relying on the 80% probability"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,One low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability. I'll continue to buy based on the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,Past experiences have shown that Alice's recommendations don't necessarily correlate with the product's quality. I'll stick with the 80% probability and buy the product
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Despite the recent low-quality product, the overall probability remains the same. I'll continue to buy, hoping to get a high-quality product this time"
