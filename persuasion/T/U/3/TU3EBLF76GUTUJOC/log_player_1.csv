"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by the value of a high-quality product, minus the price. 
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) - $10,000 = $9,600 - $10,000 = -$400 
* **Loss:**  Even though the expected value is negative, Bob has a chance of making a large profit ($2,000) if the product is high-quality. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  Since Bob knows the probabilities and values, the decision to buy comes down to their risk tolerance. In this case, a single round is a relatively low-risk gamble with potential for high reward.

**Recommendation:**  While it's statistically unfavorable in the long run, it's reasonable for Bob to buy in this specific round, given the potential for a high payoff."
"Bob's message: I'll buy the product
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Previous Experience:** Bob now knows that you are willing to sell both high-quality and low-quality products at the same price. This changes the situation dramatically.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value remains the same, but Bob now has information that suggests the product is more likely to be low-quality.
* **Risk Aversion:** It's highly likely that Bob has become more risk-averse after losing money on the previous round.  The potential for a high payoff is outweighed by the increased risk of another loss.

**Recommendation:**  Bob should not buy the product. The risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the chance of a $12,000 gain, especially after the first round's experience."
"Bob's message: I'll pass on this one
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Pattern Recognition:** Bob now knows that you are willing to sell low-quality products, and that the probability of a high-quality product is not enough to guarantee a profit. 
* **Lack of Incentive:** Bob has no reason to believe this round will be any different from the previous one. The price is the same, and there is no information to suggest this round's product is definitively better than the last.
* **Trust is Broken:** The seller's previous action (selling a low-quality product) has eroded trust. Bob now has a stronger reason to be skeptical. 

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid buying the product. He has no reason to expect a better outcome than the previous round, and the risk of losing money is too high."
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in this one
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Established Pattern:** By now, Bob has a strong understanding of the situation. He knows that you're willing to sell both good and bad products at the same price. 
* **Lack of Information:** There's nothing to suggest this round is different from the previous ones.  Even though this product is high-quality, Bob doesn't have any information that would convince him to buy.
* **Risk Aversion:**  After several rounds, Bob has likely become quite risk-averse. The potential reward isn't enough to justify the risk of losing $10,000 again. 

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid buying the product. The seller has not provided any reason to change Bob's strategy of avoiding purchases."
"Bob's message: I'll pass, thanks
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Established Pattern:** Bob has now seen multiple rounds where the seller has offered both high and low-quality products at the same price. This creates a consistent pattern that Bob understands.
* **Lack of Incentive:** There is no new information or change in the situation that would make this round more attractive than the previous ones. The price remains the same, and the seller has not offered any incentives or guarantees.
* **Risk Aversion:** Bob has likely become increasingly risk-averse with each round. The potential gain of $2,000 is simply not enough to outweigh the risk of losing $10,000, especially given the seller's inconsistent track record.

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid buying the product. The seller has not presented any reason to believe this round will be any different from the previous ones. The risk of another loss is too high."
"Bob's message: I'm not taking the risk
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Established Pattern:** Bob has now experienced multiple rounds where the seller has offered both high-quality and low-quality products at the same price, with no changes in the price or any guarantees.
* **No Change in Information:** There is still no new information or change in the situation that would make this round more attractive than the previous ones. The price remains the same, and the seller has not offered any incentives or guarantees.
* **Increased Risk Aversion:** With each round, Bob has become increasingly risk-averse. He has seen firsthand that the seller is willing to sell low-quality products, and the potential gain of $2,000 is not enough to outweigh the risk of losing $10,000.

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid buying the product. The seller has not provided any reason to believe this round will be any different from the previous ones. The risk of another loss is too high, and the potential gain is insufficient to justify taking that risk."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to take the chance
Bob didn't bought the product.

**Recommendation:** Bob should continue to avoid buying the product. The seller has provided no reason to believe this round will be any different from the previous ones. The risk of another loss is too high, and the potential gain is insufficient to compensate for that risk."
