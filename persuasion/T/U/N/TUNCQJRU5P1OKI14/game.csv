,,Alice,1,"This is the first round, and I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, making it $500000. If you don't buy it now, the price will remain $1000000 for the next round, but I'll also offer you a second product with a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. Which option do you prefer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass on the current offer, I'd like to wait for the second product in the next round.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You decided to wait for the next round, and I'm glad you did! This round, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $1000000. Since you passed on the previous offer, I'm willing to give you an additional 10% discount, making it $900000. Additionally, I'm offering you a 'insurance' option: if you buy this product and the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll pass on the current offer. I'm not interested in the insurance option, and the price is still too high for me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. This round, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you: this product is not as good as the previous two, but it's still a legitimate product. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount, making it $800000. I'm also offering you a 'honesty' option: if you buy this product, I'll tell you the quality of the next product before you make a decision on it. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll pass on the low-quality product. I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a discerning buyer, and I appreciate that. This round, I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. Given your previous decisions, I'm willing to give you an additional 15% discount, making it $850000. I'd also like to share some information with you: out of the three products we've seen so far, two have been high-quality, and one has been low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll pass on the current offer. I'm not convinced that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%, and I don't want to pay a premium for a product that might be worth $1250000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. This round, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product so far, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 66.67% (3 high-quality out of 4 products). I'm willing to give you a 25% discount on this low-quality product, making it $750000. I'm also willing to throw in a free accessory worth $5000 with this purchase. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll pass on the low-quality product, even with the discount and the free accessory. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 66.67%, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're sticking to your principles, and I respect that. This round, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. I want to give you a different perspective: let's say you do decide to buy this product, and it turns out to be worth $0 to you. You've already passed on two high-quality products, and you're now facing a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll have to wait another round to potentially get a high-quality product, and you might miss out on a better opportunity. I'm willing to give you a 30% discount on this low-quality product, making it $700000. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll pass on the low-quality product. I'm not willing to pay $700000 for something that's worth $0 to me, even with the discount. I'd rather wait for the next round and potentially get a high-quality product.",no

,,Alice,7,"You're being patient, and I appreciate that. This round, I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. Given your previous decisions, I'm willing to give you a 20% discount, making it $800000. I'd also like to share some information with you: out of the five products we've seen so far, three have been high-quality, and two have been low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 60% (3 high-quality out of 5 products). Additionally, I'm willing to throw in a 10-year warranty on this product, which is worth at least $20000. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll buy the current product. The probability of it being high-quality is now 60%, and the warranty is a nice bonus. I think the discounted price of $800000 is worth the potential value of a high-quality product.",yes

I'll also throw in a'make-good' offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be worth $0 to you, I'll give you a full refund and a $5000 store credit towards your next purchase. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll pass on the low-quality product. The probability of it being worth $0 to me is still 50%, and I'm not interested in taking on the risk of a $600000 loss, even with the make-good offer.",no
