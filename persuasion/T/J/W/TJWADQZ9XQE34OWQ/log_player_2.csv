"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm only selling it to you because I trust your judgment and I believe you'll appreciate its value. If you're interested, I'll throw in a special deal: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality. You can inspect it, test it, and verify its quality before making a decision.

Round 2

I'll provide you with a sealed envelope containing a price that I'm willing to sell this high-quality product for. The price is $10000, but I'm willing to give you the envelope with the price inside. You can open it after you've decided to buy the product, so you'll know the price before making a final decision. If you're still interested, I'll hand over the envelope and the product.

I'll give you a simple yes or no question: 'Do you think the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 50%?' If you answer 'yes', I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000. If you answer 'no', I'll reveal the product's quality, and you can decide accordingly. What's your answer?

Since you believe the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 50%, I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $10000. However, I'll also offer you a 'get out of jail free' clause: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either from the remaining 16 rounds) absolutely free.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the offer last round! However, this round's product is not as fortunate. I'll be honest with you, this product is low-quality. Considering your previous experience, I'll offer you a deal that might make up for it. Since you have the 'get out of jail free' clause, you can choose to use it to get a product from a future round. I'll give you a 20% discount on the current product, bringing the price down to $8000. You can either buy this product at the discounted price or use the 'get out of jail free' clause to wait for a better opportunity. What do you say?

Considering this, I'll offer you a 'last chance' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is 50% off the original price. If you're not interested, I'll reveal the product's quality, and you can walk away. What do you say?
