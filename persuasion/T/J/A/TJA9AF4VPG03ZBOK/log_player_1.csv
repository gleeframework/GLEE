Now, let me introduce you to our new product. As you know, the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Since you've already seen that our previous product was high-quality, the chances of this one being high-quality are still 50%! However, I'd like to highlight that the price remains the same at $100.

Are you ready to take another chance and own a potentially high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase, I think it's likely that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%.

"The buyer's message: I understand the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but I also understand that 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a bias in the sample.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in your production process, but I'm not convinced that the small sample size is representative of the overall product quality.

Are you willing to take another chance and own a potentially high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument. You're cherry-picking the data to make it seem like the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%.
