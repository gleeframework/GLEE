  ""message"": ""I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. It seems that Alice has a 100% success rate in discouraging buyers from purchasing low-quality products, which suggests that all 3 previous products sold were low-quality. If that's the case, the proportion of low-quality products sold would be 3/3 = 1.00, which is higher than the expected 0.20. This discrepancy is unlikely, and I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality. I'd like to take a closer look at the product before making a decision.""
