Alice's message: We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total, which is a bit lower than our expected 80% rate. This might indicate that our high-quality rate is not as high as we thought.

With 3 low-quality products out of 5 total, I'd like to offer you a more transparent deal: this product is definitely low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $50.
