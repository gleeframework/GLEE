,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low quality, I'd like to pass."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the previous two products and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous two products. Were they high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and the potential reward is substantial."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased, and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data or get a second opinion before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold and your low probability of getting a high-quality product, I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and I'd like to pass on this product. I'm curious to see the outcome, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the products Alice is offering are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, considering the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any reason to believe that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer. I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like Alice is not accurately recommending high-quality products. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. Since she hasn't recommended any product to the previous 4 buyers, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given Alice's recommendation and the previous sales record, which suggests a high proportion of low-quality products."
