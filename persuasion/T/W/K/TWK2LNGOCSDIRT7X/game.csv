,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than expected.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 products sold were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product you're offering me is also low-quality.
