"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the quality of the product, you have to rely on Alice's recommendation. In this case, she recommends buying it, and while there's a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0)."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your advice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. Since she's not recommending the product, it's likely that she sees a higher chance of it being low-quality.  While there's still a possibility of it being high-quality, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward in this case."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now recommended against buying a product for two rounds in a row. While this doesn't guarantee the current product is low-quality, it significantly increases the likelihood.
