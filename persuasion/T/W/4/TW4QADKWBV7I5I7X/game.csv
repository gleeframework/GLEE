low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of it being high quality is still high enough to make it worth the gamble, despite Alice's recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality and losing $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what led you to advise against buying it?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that your previous recommendations were not in my favor, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. Since 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Your previous recommendations suggest that the products are more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm hesitant to spend $10000 on a product that might be worthless to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
