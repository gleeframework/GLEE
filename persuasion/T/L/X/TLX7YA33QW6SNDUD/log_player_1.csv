Since you asked, I can tell you that I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. Given that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, and the expected value is $1000000 * 0.5 = $500000. However, if I'm wrong, I'll lose $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk.
