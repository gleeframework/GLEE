"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product for sale. It's a great opportunity, but I want to be transparent with you - I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality, I'll pass on this one.""}\n\nHow's that? I've decided not to buy the product due to the high probability of it being low quality. Let me know what happens next!"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your encouragement, Alice, but with a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll need more convincing or a better understanding of the product's quality before making a purchase.""}\n\nStill not enough information to change my decision.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that every product has its unique strengths. Although I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality, I can tell you that this product has... let's say, 'hidden potential'. Would you be willing to take a chance on it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the sales pitch, Alice, but 'hidden potential' doesn't give me any concrete reason to believe this product is more likely to be high quality. The odds are still against me, so I'll pass.""}"

I'm not just trying to make a sale; I genuinely believe you won't regret taking a chance on this one. It's worth considering, even with the uncertainty.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I've heard similar pitches before, and the products turned out to be low quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you make a valid point. I have passed on four products, and one of them was indeed high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to re-evaluate your approach. It sounds like you're not confident in this product either. I'll wait for a future product that you're more enthusiastic about.""}"
