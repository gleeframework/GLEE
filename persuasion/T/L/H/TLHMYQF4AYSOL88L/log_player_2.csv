"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it, but only if you buy it now. If you don't buy it, the price will go back to the original $10000. What do you say?

Round 4

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob.

I'll sell you this product for $5000, and I'll give you a 'get out of one free' card. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free pass on the next product, no questions asked.

I'll offer you a 'break-even' deal: I'll sell it to you for $10000, and if it's high-quality, you'll be breaking even on your previous purchases.
