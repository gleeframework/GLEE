"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

You should recommend Bob *not* to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Known Probability:** Bob knows the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality and a 20% chance of being low-quality.
* **Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to Bob, while a low-quality product is worth $0.
* **Price:** The product is being sold for $1,000,000.

Even though there's a high chance the product is good, there's a 20% risk it's low-quality. In that case, Bob would lose $1,000,000. This risk outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product."
