Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products now. The previous buyer's decision to pass on the high-quality product was likely due to uncertainty about the product's value, as they mentioned. I'm willing to offer some insight: my previous sales strategy is to sell high-quality products to those who are willing to take the risk, and low-quality products to those who are more cautious. The price remains the same: $10000.
