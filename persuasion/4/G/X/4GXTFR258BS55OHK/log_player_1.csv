"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about the buyer's valuation:**  You have no information about how much the buyer values a low-quality product. There's a high chance they will not find it worth $1,000,000.
* **High price:** The price is extremely high, even for a high-quality product. 
* **No track record:** The buyer has no information about your past sales, making it impossible for them to assess your reliability or the quality of your products.

**Overall, there is no incentive for the buyer to take this risk.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Given the lack of data and your advice, I'll pass on this product. I'd like to see how the next few sales go before making a decision.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still no information about buyer's valuation:**  You still don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **No track record:**  The buyer has seen one sale (and you declined to recommend it), which doesn't provide any information about your reliability or product quality. 
* **High price:** The price is still extremely high, and the buyer has no incentive to take a gamble without more information.

**Even though the product is high-quality, there is still no reason to recommend it to the buyer.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I will pass on this product.  Since there's no historical data to suggest a better than 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm not willing to risk the $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Overall, there is no reason to recommend this product to the buyer.**"
