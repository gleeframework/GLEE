"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, it's still a gamble worth taking.  If it's high quality, the profit is significant ($20,000).  If it's low quality, you lose $10,000.  

Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending it, it's reasonable to assume there's a slightly higher chance of it being high quality.  This is a risky but potentially profitable decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she recommended the first product, which was high quality, and now she's not recommending this one, it's highly likely this product is low quality.  Therefore, it's safer to pass and avoid the potential loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll take a chance on this one again.  Let's see how this goes!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since she's recommending again, and we know she has information about the quality, there's a good chance this product is high quality.  We've already seen that her recommendations can be trusted. While there's still a risk, the potential profit is high enough to justify the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.  Your recommendations have been accurate so far, and I'll trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is very influential. Since she recommended the last two products, which were both high quality, and now she's not recommending this one, it strongly suggests that this product is likely low quality. It's safer to pass and avoid the potential loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been very accurate so far.  She has correctly predicted the quality of the product in every round.

```

**Reasoning:**
