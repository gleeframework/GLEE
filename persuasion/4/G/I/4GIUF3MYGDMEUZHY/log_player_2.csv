I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not sure what the quality of this one is. But I can tell you that 80% of my products are high-quality. You can take a chance and buy it, or walk away. The choice is yours!

Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far, which is a 50% success rate. I know 80% of my products are high-quality, so it's possible that the first product was just a lucky draw. However, I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, which is a 66.67% success rate. This suggests that I might be selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than the average. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?

If I'm being completely honest, it's possible that I've somehow managed to curate a sequence of high-quality products.
