,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you're not recommending it, but I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one to see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them did suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, but given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous sales, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you provide that?

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it seems likely that the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to advise me to pass? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else? I'd love to understand your thought process.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
