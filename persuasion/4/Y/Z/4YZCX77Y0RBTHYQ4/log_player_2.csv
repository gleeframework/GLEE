{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, it's highly likely she is recommending a high-quality product. Even though there is a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is perfect, with two consecutive recommendations leading to high-quality products. It's highly likely that she knows this current product is low quality, and her decision to not recommend it is a strong indicator.
