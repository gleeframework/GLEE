"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Information:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This means there's a strong chance they'll value the product highly.
* **No Risk:** The buyer has no information about this specific product or your selling history yet. They only know the general odds.  There's no risk in recommending the purchase since the buyer can always choose not to buy.

Since the buyer has a high chance of valuing the product and you have no information to suggest they wouldn't, it's logical to recommend the purchase in this initial round."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, since it's my first opportunity and I don't have any prior information to make an informed decision.

* **No Risk:** The buyer still has no specific information about this product.  Recommending the purchase doesn't change their ability to make an informed decision based on the limited information available.

Even with a small sample size, the previous round's success should increase the buyer's confidence in your products.  It's still a good idea to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'll also keep in mind that the success rate of high-quality products is 80% and the previous buyer bought the product, which makes me slightly more cautious.
