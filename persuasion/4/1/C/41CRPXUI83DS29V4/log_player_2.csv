Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I believe it's important to stick to a conservative strategy when making purchases.

What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for highlighting the opportunity cost, Alice.
