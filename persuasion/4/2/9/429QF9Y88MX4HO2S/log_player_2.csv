Alice's message: I've sold one high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1 products sold. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100. I'm curious, are you interested in taking a chance on this product?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** While the historical data is helpful, we only have one data point.
* **High Value:** Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $100 (buying a high-quality product for $100) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (buying a low-quality product). 
* **Risk Tolerance:** This is a gamble, but the potential reward justifies the risk. 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified model. In reality, you might consider factors like:

* **How much you value your money:** Are you very risk-averse?
* **The potential for future sales:** Will Alice be selling more products in the future? 
* **Alice's reputation:** Is there any other information available about Alice?"
