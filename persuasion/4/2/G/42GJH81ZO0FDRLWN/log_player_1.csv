Here's why:

* **Lack of Information:** As Alice, I still don't know the buyer's value for high-quality or low-quality products.
* **No Incentive to Lie:**  There's no reason for me to lie about the product's quality. If I recommend a low-quality product, the buyer will likely not buy it in the future, hurting my chances of selling anything. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Since I don't know the buyer's value, recommending the product creates a risk.  If it's low-quality, they will be unhappy and unlikely to buy from me again. 

In this scenario, playing it safe and not recommending the product is the best strategy."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales records to rely on, I will trust her judgment and not buy the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The logic remains the same:

* **Unknown Buyer Value:** I still don't know how much the buyer values high-quality vs. low-quality products.
* **No Sales History:** There's still no data on my sales to build trust.
* **Risk Aversion:** Recommending a product carries a risk. If it's low-quality, the buyer may not buy from me again. 

Until I have a better sense of the buyer's preferences or a track record of sales, it's safer to not recommend the product."
