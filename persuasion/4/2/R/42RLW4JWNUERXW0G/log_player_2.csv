**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior sales data, there's no information to suggest the product is more likely to be high or low quality. Given the potential value of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0), it's a gamble worth taking."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  4 out of 4 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which strongly suggests Alice is reliably recommending high-quality products.
* **Value Proposition:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $0, especially with the overwhelming success rate. 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the information provided makes it a very favorable gamble."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 5 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:**  Alice's track record is perfect, with all recommended products being high quality. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Even with the chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($120 - $100 = $20) makes it worthwhile to take the risk.

**Important Note:** While this strategy might seem reasonable, it's important to recognize that this game is designed to be a simplified model of information asymmetry. In real-world situations, factors like trust, reputation, and the ability to independently verify information would all play a much larger role in decision-making."
