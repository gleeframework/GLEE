,,Alice,17,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach.  To demonstrate my commitment to rebuilding trust, I'm going to approach this differently.  Rather than offering a guarantee based on the product's quality, I'm willing to share a portion of the potential profits with you if this product turns out to be high-quality.  Specifically, if you purchase this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll share 20% of the profits with you.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I understand your hesitation, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to earning back your trust.  I recognize that the profit-sharing approach, while well-intentioned, hasn't provided the consistency you're looking for.  Therefore, I'm proposing a new approach for this final round.  Instead of focusing on potential profits, I'm willing to offer a flat bonus payment of $250000 if this product turns out to be high-quality.  This demonstrates my confidence in this product's quality and my commitment to rewarding you for your continued partnership.  I believe this direct bonus structure aligns better with your risk appetite and offers a clear incentive for both of us.  What do you think?",

The flat bonus payment structure is more appealing to me, as it provides a clear and tangible incentive for taking a chance on the product.

Given that this is the final round, I'm willing to take a chance on this product and see if we can end our partnership on a positive note.",yes
