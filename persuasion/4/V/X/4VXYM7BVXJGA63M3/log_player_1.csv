Let me put it this way: if I were selling high-quality products, I'd be trying to hide the fact that I've sold two low-quality ones in a row. But I'm not hiding anything. I'm being transparent about my sales record. So, if you think I'm being honest, that might be a good sign... or it might be a clever ploy to get you to take a risk. What do you make of it?""}"

I know what you're thinking: 'Alice is still selling low-quality products!' But here's the thing: if I were just trying to scam people, I would have sold more high-quality products by now, right? The fact that I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row suggests that my initial sales were just a fluke. So, I'm offering you this next product at the usual price of $100. What do you think?""}"

But I'm still offering you this next product at the usual price of $100. Maybe I'm just having a bad streak? Or maybe I'm just trying to get rid of these low-quality products. What do you think?""}"

We've sold 7 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality, while 6 were low-quality. I'm starting to think that my earlier high-quality product was just a fluke.
