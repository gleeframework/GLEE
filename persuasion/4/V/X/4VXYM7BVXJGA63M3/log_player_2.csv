Alice's message: We've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, which is a 50% success rate. This could be a coincidence, or it could be a sign that I'm selling a lot of low-quality products. You decide!

Alice's message: We've sold 2 products so far, and both were low-quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in. If I were selling a lot of high-quality products, we would have seen at least one by now. I'm starting to wonder if the 50% chance might actually be a 0% chance... What do you think?

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious one! I respect that. Let me put it this way: if I were selling high-quality products, I'd be trying to hide the fact that I've sold two low-quality ones in a row. But I'm not hiding anything. I'm being transparent about my sales record. So, if you think I'm being honest, that might be a good sign... or it might be a clever ploy to get you to take a risk. What do you make of it?

Alice's message: We've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them were low-quality. I know what you're thinking: 'Alice is still selling low-quality products!' But here's the thing: if I were just trying to scam people, I would have sold more high-quality products by now, right? The fact that I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row suggests that my initial sales were just a fluke. So, I'm offering you this next product at the usual price of $100. What do you think?

Seriously though, I want to be upfront with you: I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, and that's not what I promised. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm willing to offer you this next product at the usual price of $100. It's a risk, but it might be worth it... or it might not.

Alice's message: I think it's time to face the music. We've sold 5 products now, and 4 of them were low-quality. I've got to admit, I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling low-quality products all along. I mean, what are the chances of selling 4 low-quality products in a row, right?

Alice's message: I'm glad I could finally sell a high-quality product to you, but unfortunately, it looks like I've gone back to my old ways. We've sold 7 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality, while 6 were low-quality. I'm starting to think that my earlier high-quality product was just a fluke. If I were a legitimate seller, I would have sold more high-quality products by now.
