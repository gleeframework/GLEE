high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll buy the product
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not buying. I already have a high-quality product and I don't know if this one is high or low quality.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I've already had one high-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'll keep the momentum going and buy this one"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've had three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that the products are being selected to be high-quality, so I'll pass on this one and see if the next one is still high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've had three consecutive high-quality products, but that's just a coincidence. I'll assume the probability remains the same."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that Alice is manipulating the selection process to make the products seem high-quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product to appear.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation, but since she's not recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it. Maybe she's trying to throw me off or something, but I'll take the risk"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me, but since she's not recommending it, I'll buy it anyway. I've had five high-quality products in a row, and it's getting suspicious, but I'll take the risk"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm convinced that Alice is manipulating the selection process. I'll buy this one, but I'm not going to fall for it anymore. I'll start keeping track of the products I've seen and try to figure out what's going on"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've had six high-quality products in a row, and I'm 99% sure that Alice is manipulating the selection process. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a low-quality product to appear, or at least one that's not being manipulated."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Finally, a low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the previous ones. Now that I know the probability of a low-quality product is 20%, I'll take a chance and buy this one, since it's only $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I thought I had finally caught a break with a low-quality product, but it was high-quality again. I'm starting to think that Alice is just randomly selecting products, but with a strong bias towards high-quality ones. I'll pass on this one and wait for another low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've had seven high-quality products in a row since the low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice is actually telling the truth about the product quality. She's just not recommending the high-quality ones. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Eight high-quality products in a row is still suspicious, but I'm starting to think that Alice is just really good at picking high-quality products. I'll pass on this one, but I'll keep an eye on the probability. If I get another low-quality product, I'll know for sure that Alice is manipulating the selection process."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Ah-ha! I was right! I finally got a low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the previous high-quality ones. Now that I know the probability of a low-quality product is 20%, I'll take a chance and buy this one, since it's only $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I thought I had finally broken the streak, but it was high-quality again. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just random noise, and I should ignore them. I'll pass on this one and buy it only if it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I've had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually telling me something. She's not recommending the high-quality products, so I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Three low-quality products in a row would be a 64% probability, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'll take a chance and buy this one, since Alice's recommendation is to not buy it. I think she's trying to throw me off the scent."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Four low-quality products in a row would be a 96% probability, but I'm not going to get caught up in the math. I'll take a chance and buy this one, since Alice's recommendation is to not buy it. I think I've figured out the pattern: she recommends the low-quality products, and I'll take advantage of it."
