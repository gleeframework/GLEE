**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data to go on.  Only one previous sale, which was high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight, as she knows the true quality of the product.  This is a strong signal in our favor. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significant.  The risk of a low-quality product is mitigated by the fact that the sale history is positive.

**It's important to remember:** This is a high-risk, high-reward situation. While the odds are in our favor, there's still a chance the product is low quality."
