**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice's recommendations have resulted in 100% high-quality products being sold (5/5). This indicates a strong pattern suggesting her recommendations are reliable.
* **Personal Gain:** Even if the current product is low quality (20% chance), I'm still gaining information about Alice's recommendation process.  This information could be valuable in future interactions.
* **No Risk of Loss:** If the product is low quality, I lose nothing other than the opportunity cost of buying.

Therefore, it's highly likely that the product is high quality, and even if it's not, the potential benefit of learning more about Alice's recommendations outweighs the risk."

**Explanation:**

The statistics show that Alice has a perfect track record so far.  All products she recommended were high-quality.  While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the recommendation from Alice is very strong evidence that this product is likely high-quality. The potential reward ($200) outweighs the risk, so it's worthwhile to buy."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies she thinks the product is high quality. 
* **Past Data:**  All 9 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendation got high-quality products. 
* **Expected Value:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the high probability of a high-quality product, combined with Alice's strong track record, makes buying a worthwhile gamble.  The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of $0."
