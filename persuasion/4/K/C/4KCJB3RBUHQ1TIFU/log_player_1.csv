"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality, it's in his best interest to buy. The price is fixed and the product is non-refundable, but the potential value of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of it being low-quality, especially with an 80% chance of it being high-quality."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the previous product, which was also high-quality. This suggests he values high-quality products and is willing to take the risk given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. There is no reason to change this strategy, and recommending the purchase again is the best course of action."

Since this product is also high-quality, recommending the purchase again is the most logical course of action."
