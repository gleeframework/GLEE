"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000). In the long run, buying every product should result in an overall positive outcome."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  Since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on this one.  Maybe you'll have something better for me in the next round.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality.  While there's always a chance it could be high-quality, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $2,500.  It's better to err on the side of caution and pass."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I'll take it. Your recommendations have been pretty accurate so far!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's recommendation was wrong in the previous round, it's still valuable information.  Her recommendations have been correct more often than not, so it's likely this product is high-quality.  The potential gain ($2,500) outweighs the risk ($10,000) given the track record."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation history is strong, with four out of four correct recommendations. Her lack of recommendation in this round strongly suggests the product is likely low-quality.
