,,Alice,7,"I understand your curiosity about the probability of the streak continuing. As I mentioned earlier, the underlying distribution is 80% high-quality products and 20% low-quality products. The streak is just a coincidence, and it's likely to end soon. In fact, I'm experiencing a rare sequence of high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100, knowing that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than usual?",
