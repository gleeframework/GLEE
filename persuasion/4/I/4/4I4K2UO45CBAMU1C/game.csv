,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced it's high quality based on Alice's recommendation and the previous sales record, which suggests that all products offered so far have been low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the outcome."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended for purchase were low-quality. I'm skeptical about the recommendation and will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering your past recommendations have not been very encouraging."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This is lower than the expected 0.5, suggesting that the products sold so far are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is not recommending me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it, assuming it might be low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it. I think she might be trying to manipulate the sales record by not recommending low-quality products, so I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be due to the fact that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to be the one who ends up buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the statistics and my own risk assessment."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
