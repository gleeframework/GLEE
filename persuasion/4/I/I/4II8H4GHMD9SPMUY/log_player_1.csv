{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products to all buyers, so I'll take a chance and pass.
