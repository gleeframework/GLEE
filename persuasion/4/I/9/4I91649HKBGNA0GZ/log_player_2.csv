I want to be transparent with you - my track record is looking great, and you might be wondering if I'm just getting lucky. But, I assure you that my products are randomly selected, and there's still a chance that this next one could be a dud. The price remains the same at $100.

With 2 out of 3 products sold being high-quality, the probability of this next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. That's a 1 in 3 chance!

Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! You're right, 2 out of 3 products sold being high-quality does suggest that there might be a higher proportion of low-quality products in my inventory.
