,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the seller's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a bad deal for me. However, since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision on any information about the previous buyers, but rather on the lack of recommendation from you."

,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I will pass on this product."
