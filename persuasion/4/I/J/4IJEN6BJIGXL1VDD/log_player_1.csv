A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%) and you've revealed this round's product is high-quality, there's a 100% chance it's valuable to them. Even though the buyer doesn't know the exact value, the potential upside is significantly higher than the risk of buying a low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, I choose not to take the risk.

Here's why:

* **No Negative Information:** The buyer has no specific information about this round's product that would make them think it's low-quality. 
* **Previous Rounds' Impact:** The buyer may be slightly hesitant due to previous rejections, but that shouldn't outweigh the potential reward of buying a known high-quality product.

You should recommend the purchase and see if the buyer is willing to take the risk this time, given the clear indication of a high-quality product."
