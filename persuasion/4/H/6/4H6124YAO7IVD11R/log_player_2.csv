"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $30000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 66.67% discount. This is a one-time offer. If you decline, I'll move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price further. Can we meet in the middle at $15,000?""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I've already made a concession by offering it at $10000. Meeting you in the middle would put the price at $20000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to offer you a small additional discount to $12000, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your additional concession, but I'm not convinced that this is the best deal. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one has to offer.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 3

This suggests that the odds are in your favor. I'm willing to offer you an even lower price of $11000 for this high-quality product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'll pass on this product.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide you with more data. So far, we've had 3 rounds, and 2 of them have been high-quality products. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is now 66.67%. Considering this new information, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal: $10500 for this high-quality product. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the additional data, but I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is 66.67%. In fact, I think it's still 50%, and I don't want to overpay for a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to point out that you've now had a chance to see the product's quality before making a decision, and you can be certain that this product is indeed low-quality. Given that you've already passed on two high-quality products at discounted prices, I'm now offering you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $10000. Since it's worthless to you, I'm essentially giving it away. I'm willing to make a deal, but you need to decide quickly, as I have other interested buyers for this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I want to incentivize you to take advantage of this great deal.
