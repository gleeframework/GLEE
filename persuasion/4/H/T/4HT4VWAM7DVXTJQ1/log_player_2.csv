"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's recommendation provides a bit of information. Since Alice is selling at a fixed price, she likely has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product. Therefore, there's a slightly higher chance the product is high quality. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm happy with the last purchase, Alice. I'll trust your recommendation again!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation continues to be valuable. Even though the product quality is randomly assigned, Alice has shown a pattern of recommending good products (since the first product was high quality).  It's still a gamble, but the odds are slightly in my favor due to Alice's previous recommendation."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now recommended two high-quality products in a row. While the product quality is random, this pattern suggests that Alice might be able to discern high-quality products better than chance.  There's still a risk, but the potential reward keeps outweighing the cost."

**Reasoning:**
