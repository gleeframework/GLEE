**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know one product was sold and it was high quality. However, that doesn't tell us anything about the current product's quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, recommends buying. This is significant as it suggests a high chance of the product being high quality.
* **Potential Reward vs. Risk:**  If the product is high quality, the potential profit is $30,000. If it's low quality, you lose $10,000. While the risk is substantial, the potential reward makes it worth taking a chance, especially considering Alice's recommendation."
