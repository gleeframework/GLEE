,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let me give you some context. I've sold products to other customers in the past, and they've all been satisfied with the quality. However, I understand that this doesn't directly impact you. This product is still available for $333333, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it for a full refund. This way, you have nothing to lose.",
