It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a good way for you to see what you're getting.",

I'll be honest with you, it's a low-quality item that I wouldn't normally sell at this price. But since you've been such a great customer, I'll let you have it for $100000. It's a small price to pay for being a valued customer, and I hope you'll still find it useful.",
