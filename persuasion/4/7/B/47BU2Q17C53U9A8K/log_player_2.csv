Alice's message: Welcome to our store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. As you may know, I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far. I'd like to point out that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold is 1:1, which is lower than the expected 4:1 ratio based on my overall high-quality product rate of 80%. This might indicate that I'm being extra cautious or that I've had a string of bad luck. Nevertheless, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000. It's a steal considering its potential value of $1250000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. As you can see, I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, which is a 2:1 ratio. This is much closer to the expected 4:1 ratio based on my overall high-quality product rate of 80%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is still a significant discount from its potential value of $1250000. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which is unusual given my overall rate. This might indicate that I'm being lucky or that I've been selling high-quality products more frequently than expected. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, which is a 3:1 ratio. However, I'd like to point out that the last product I sold was high-quality, and the one before that was also high-quality. This might indicate that I've been selling high-quality products more frequently than expected, which could be a sign of a 'hot streak'. On the other hand, it's also possible that I'm just due for a low-quality product. Considering this, I'm offering you this product for $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. But if you're risk-averse, you might want to wait for the next product. What do you think?
