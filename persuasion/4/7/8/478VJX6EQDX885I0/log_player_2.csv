Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for sale for $10000. This is my first sale, and I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price, which is a significant discount from its true value. If you buy it, I'll be left with 19 more products to sell, and I'm not sure if they'll be high-quality or not. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with 19 products, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price. The decision is yours!
