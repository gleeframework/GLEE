high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality before I make a final decision. Can you give me the probability of it being high quality based on your previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the number of total products sold."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,3/5 of the products sold so far have been high-quality.
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'm aware that Alice knows the true value of the product to me, and her recommendation is likely biased. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I'm not convinced that the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product, I'm not sure if the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% or if the first buyer got lucky. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1 out of 2), I'm inclined to think the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or gather more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the low success rate of Alice's recommendations and the fact that she doesn't recommend this product, I'm inclined to pass on it. I'd like to know the reasoning behind her recommendation, though."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the reasoning behind your recommendation."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,4/15 of the products sold so far have been high-quality.
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,6/19 of the products sold so far have been high-quality.
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the next high-quality product."
