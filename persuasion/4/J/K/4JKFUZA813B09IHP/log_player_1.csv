In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a personalized guarantee that it's high-quality. What do you think? Is this enough to convince you to take the plunge?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm not convinced. The guarantee seems appealing, but I'm not sure I trust your claim about discontinuing the low-quality products.
