high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $20000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a 50% discount. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price, and you might miss out on a great deal.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for a 50% discount on a product that I only value at $0 if it's low quality. I'll wait for more information.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more information. Since this is the second high-quality product in a row, the probability that I'm selling high-quality products is now 66.67%. If you buy this product, I'll give you a unique serial number that will be registered with me. If you ever want to verify the product's quality, you can contact me, and I'll confirm that it's indeed high-quality. This way, you can be confident in your purchase.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high-quality has increased to 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also interested in the unique serial number and the verification option.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're satisfied with your previous purchase! Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you the unique serial number and verification option, just like before. Additionally, I'll throw in a free inspection report from a third-party expert, which will confirm the product's quality. This way, you'll have an extra layer of assurance that you're getting a high-quality product. The price remains the same at $10000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if the free inspection report adds any significant value, considering the 66.67% probability of the product being high-quality. I'll pass on this offer and wait for more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to be transparent with you. This product is indeed low-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the high-quality products, $10000. However, I'm also willing to offer you a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a 10% discount. This way, you can potentially get a high-quality product at a lower price, and you'll still be getting a good deal on this low-quality product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the low-quality product for $10000, but only because I think I'll get a 10% discount on the next product, which has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on the next product, even if this one is worthless to me.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product! As promised, you'll get a 10% discount on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a great deal considering its value of $20000. Additionally, I'll remind you that you still have the option to verify the quality of this product with the unique serial number and third-party inspection report. I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase, and I'm willing to offer you a special guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality (which is highly unlikely), I'll give you a full refund and we'll start fresh with the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the high-quality product for $9000, considering the 10% discount and the guarantee. The probability of it being low-quality is still 66.67%, but the potential upside is worth the risk, and the guarantee provides some protection.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're satisfied with your previous purchase! Given the recent streak of low-quality products, I want to be transparent with you. I understand that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I also want to acknowledge that the recent trend suggests a lower likelihood. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' on this product. I'll start by selling it to you for $8000, but if you're not interested, I'll gradually decrease the price by $1000 each round until you decide to buy it or until the price reaches $0. This way, you can get a great deal on a low-quality product, and I'll be able to clear out some inventory.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'll wait for the price to decrease and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your stance on low-quality products. Given the current price of $7000, I'd like to offer you a 'lottery ticket' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to win a future high-quality product at a fixed price of $5000. The lottery ticket will be drawn randomly, and if you win, you'll get the high-quality product at the discounted price. If you don't win, you'll still get this low-quality product for $7000. This way, you have a chance to win a great deal, and I'll be able to clear out this low-quality product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a lottery ticket. The probability of winning a high-quality product is unknown, and the potential cost of a low-quality product is too high.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism about the lottery ticket. Given the current price of $6000, I'd like to offer you a 'last chance' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you ever decide to buy a high-quality product from me in the future. This way, you can essentially 'lock in' the refund and have a guarantee that you'll get your money back if you don't end up buying a high-quality product. This is a one-time offer, and I'll throw in the unique serial number and third-party inspection report, so you can verify the product's quality if you ever need to.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the low-quality product for $6000, but only because I'm interested in the full refund guarantee on a future high-quality product. I'll keep an eye on future offers and hope to get a high-quality product at a good price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product! As promised, you now have the full refund guarantee for a future high-quality product. Considering the current price of $5000, I'd like to remind you that you can use this guarantee to get a refund if you buy a high-quality product in the future. However, I'd like to offer you a new deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to'steal' a high-quality product from a future round. If you win, you'll get to buy the high-quality product at the price you paid for this one ($5000). If you don't win, you'll still get this low-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in the'steal' deal. I already have a full refund guarantee, and I'm not sure what the probability of winning is. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision. Given the current streak of low-quality products, I want to make a strong offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a 60% discount from its true value of $20000. I'll also throw in the unique serial number, third-party inspection report, and the full refund guarantee from your previous purchase. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the high-quality product for $8000, considering the 60% discount and the additional guarantees. The probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%, but the potential upside is worth the risk, and the guarantees provide some protection.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the high-quality product! Given the recent trend of low-quality products, I want to make a final offer on this one. I'll sell it to you for $4000, which is a 80% discount from its true value of $20000. I'll also throw in the unique serial number, third-party inspection report, and the full refund guarantee from your previous purchase. This is my last offer, and I'm confident that you'll be getting an incredible deal on a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to fall for an 80% discount on a product that I know has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products and two low-quality products, I'll make a final offer on this one. Since you've already received a full refund guarantee on a future high-quality product, I'll give you the option to 'cash out' on that guarantee now. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a refund of $10000 (the value of the high-quality product) immediately, and you can consider this low-quality product as a 'loss' that you've already accounted for. This way, you can end the game on a high note and walk away with a guaranteed profit.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the low-quality product for $10000, but only because I'm interested in cashing out on the full refund guarantee. I'll consider this a calculated risk, and I'll take the guaranteed profit of $10000.",yes

This is my last offer, and I'm confident that you'll be getting an incredible deal on a low-quality product.",

,,Alice,16,"I think there's been a mistake! We've already reached the 20-round limit, and the game is officially over. I should have ended the game with a message in Round 15. Congratulations again on your profit, and I wish you all the best! (This is just a redundant message, as the game is already over.)",

,,Alice,18,"I think we're getting a bit repetitive here! As I mentioned earlier, the game is officially over, and we've reached the 20-round limit.
