Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far, which is a 75% success rate. If the probability of a high-quality product was truly 50%, I'd expect to see a much more even split. This product is still available for $10000, and I'm willing to let you take a chance on it.

Alice's message: I didn't expect you to be a statistician! You're absolutely right, 3 high-quality products out of 4 is not a strong indicator of a 75% success rate.
