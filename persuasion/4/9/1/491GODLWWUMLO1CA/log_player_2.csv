**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:** Since 1 out of 1 products sold so far was high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is even higher than the initial 80% chance.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has full information about the product's quality and is recommending purchase. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential gain:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $40,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk. 

Therefore, the best strategy is to buy the product based on the available information."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:** 3 out of 4 buyers have received high-quality products. This is significantly higher than the 80% expected probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable as she knows the true quality of the product.  Even with the previous data, her recommendation adds more weight to the decision.

**Note:** While the data points to a higher chance of the product being high quality, there's still a 20% chance it's low quality. The decision is based on a calculated risk, factoring in the potential reward of a high-quality product and the potential loss if it turns out to be low quality."
