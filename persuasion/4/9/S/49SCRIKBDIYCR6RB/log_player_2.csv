"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a highly sought-after product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a steal considering its true value is $3000000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart investment?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm doing it solely based on the 80% chance of it being high quality, and not because I believe your sales pitch.""
}"

Round 2

Considering your previous purchase, I'm confident you'll appreciate the consistency in quality. What do you say, are you ready to make another smart investment?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the heads up, but I'm not going to fall for it. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not going to assume it's a guarantee just because the previous one was.""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I respect your cautious approach. Let me ask you this: would you rather pay $1000000 for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $3000000, or would you rather walk away and potentially miss out on a great opportunity? The choice is yours, but I'm confident that this product is a rare gem.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

What do you say, are you willing to take a calculated risk and add this product to your collection?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
