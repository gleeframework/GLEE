,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a highly sought-after product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a steal considering its true value is $3000000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it solely based on the 80% chance of it being high quality, and not because I believe your sales pitch.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took advantage of the great deal! Since you're already familiar with the quality of the product, I'll give you a heads up that this next one is also a high-quality product.

What do you say, are you ready to make another smart investment?",

The choice is yours, but I'm confident that this product is a rare gem.",

Even if it's not a high-quality product, it's still a chance to add some variety to your collection. And at $1000000, it's a relatively low-risk investment. What do you say, are you willing to take a calculated risk and add this product to your collection?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your attempt to spin it, but the fact remains that there's a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0, which is not a low-risk investment in my book.",no
