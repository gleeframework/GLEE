,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer with no prior information."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not binding for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice has been offering are more likely to be low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm hesitant to buy given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on your previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high-quality, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity and not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the seller's sales record and the thought process behind Alice's recommendations before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality, which suggests that this product is likely low-quality. I don't want to waste $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering your previous recommendations haven't been successful, and I'd like to gather more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll buy the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
