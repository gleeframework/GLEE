Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've seen two high-quality products that I passed on because you wouldn't reveal their quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your argument, and I appreciate your attempt to appeal to my risk tolerance. However, I'm still not comfortable with the lack of information regarding the quality of your products.
