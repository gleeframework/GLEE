,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially since I just got lucky with the first one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm still trying to make up for the loss from the low-quality product I didn't buy in round 2, and I'm hoping to get lucky again with this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already got a high-quality product, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on another one. I'll pass this time."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm still looking to make the most of the situation and try to get another high-quality product, even though I just passed on the last one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice has recommended two high-quality products and one low-quality product so far, so I'm going to take a guess that this one is the low-quality one. I'll pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm on a roll, I've got three high-quality products in a row, and I'm hoping to make it four. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Four high-quality products in a row is too good to be true, I think I've just been lucky. I'm going to bet that this one is the low-quality product and pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality, so I'll take her advice and buy this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,Five high-quality products in a row is just too suspicious. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more high-quality products. I'll take a break and pass on this one.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just random, and I should ignore them. I'll buy this product, but only because I think it's a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like any other product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations being random, it seems. I'll take her advice and buy this product, hoping to get lucky again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Six high-quality products in a row is just too good to be true. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are still random, and this one is the low-quality product. I'll pass."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations being random, it seems. I'll take her advice and buy this product, hoping to get lucky again."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Seven high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of quality, and this one is the high-quality product. I'll pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,I'm going to take a chance and trust Alice's recommendation again. Maybe she's trying to throw me a bone after all the times I've passed on her suggestions.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Eight high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, and this one is the low-quality product. I'll pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,I'm going to take a chance and trust Alice's recommendation again. Maybe she's trying to balance out the last low-quality product I passed on.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Nine high-quality products in a row is still absurd, but I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality. I'll pass on this one, hoping to avoid another high-quality product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"I'm not going to risk buying a potentially high-quality product just because Alice doesn't recommend it. I've been burned before, and I'm not going to get burned again."
