But let's be real, it's probably low-quality.",

I'm willing to take the risk and find out the quality of the product after purchasing it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 13 total, and 10 low-quality products in a row. I think it's time to face the music: I'm a low-quality product seller.

,,the buyer,15,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think the fact that you've sold 4 high-quality products out of 15 total, and then 11 low-quality products in a row, suggests that you might be more likely to offer a high-quality product after a streak of low-quality products.

,,Alice,20,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 20 total, and 15 low-quality products in a row. I guess I'm a bit of a wild card, even after 20 rounds. This one is high-quality, and it's $1000000. If you want to take a chance on me, I won't judge you.",
