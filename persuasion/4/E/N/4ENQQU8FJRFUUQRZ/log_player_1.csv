Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since I have sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 50%. I will not change my strategy based on a single data point. The buyer still has no information about the quality of the product, so I will recommend buying the product to maximize my chances of selling at the high price.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since I have sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 products, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 50%. However, the buyer now has some information: they know that the previous product was low-quality, which means that the first 2 products were low-quality. This is unusual, as the probability of two consecutive low-quality products is only 25%. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality.

I will recommend buying the product to take advantage of the buyer's updated information.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since I have sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 products, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 50%. However, the buyer now has information that the previous product was high-quality, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%, since the probability of two consecutive high-quality products is 25%.

I will recommend buying the product to take advantage of the buyer's updated information.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since I have sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 5 products, the probability that the next product is high-quality is now 80%. This is because the probability of 4 consecutive high-quality products is 6.25% (0.5^4), and the probability of 4 high-quality products followed by 1 low-quality product is 0.5^4 * 0.5 = 0.0625. The probability of 5 high-quality products is negligible, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 80%.
