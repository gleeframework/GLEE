"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice has no information about the product's value to you, her recommendation is essentially random. 
* **Your decision:** You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $400, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0.  Since the price is fixed at $100, even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product justifies taking the gamble in the first round. 
* **Message:** A simple and polite message acknowledging Alice's recommendation and expressing your decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm happy with the last purchase, so I'll take another one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Again, Alice's recommendation is random.
* **Your decision:**  Even though you got a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability resets for each new product. You still have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. The potential reward of $400 still outweighs the cost of $100, making it worth buying. 
* **Message:** You can use this opportunity to be slightly more confident in your decision based on the previous positive outcome."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Two in a row, I'm feeling lucky! I'll buy this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** As always, Alice's recommendation is random.
* **Your decision:**  You've now gotten two high-quality products in a row. This doesn't change the fact that each product is independent, and you still have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. However, the streak might make you feel more optimistic about your chances. Since the potential reward outweighs the risk, buying is still the best option.
* **Message:**  Reflecting the slight uptick in confidence due to the consecutive high-quality products, while still acknowledging the inherent risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm going to take a chance on this one, even though you didn't recommend it.  I've had good luck so far!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is not to buy, which means it's not a strong indicator of the product's quality.
* **Your decision:**  You have a streak of three high-quality products, which might make you feel overly confident, but remember each product is independent. The odds are still 50/50. However, you have seen Alice's recommendations are not reliable, so her lack of recommendation doesn't deter you from buying. The potential reward remains higher than the risk.
* **Message:** You acknowledge Alice's recommendation but express your decision based on your previous experience with the product and the fact that you are willing to take a chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm still willing to give it a try.  Even though the last one was a dud, I'm hoping for a better outcome this time.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation doesn't mean anything in terms of the product's quality.
* **Your decision:** You had a setback with the last product, but each product is independent. The odds are still 50/50. You still have a chance to make a profit, and the potential reward ($400) outweighs the risk ($100). 
* **Message:** You acknowledge the previous loss, but emphasize your continued willingness to take the gamble, hoping for a better outcome."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let's keep this going!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is still random.
* **Your decision:**  Even though you had a low-quality product in round 4, you've now had another high-quality product in round 5. This might strengthen your belief that you are somehow able to predict the product's quality based on your own experience. However, remember this is just confirmation bias, and the odds remain 50/50. The potential reward for buying a high-quality product still outweighs the risk. 
* **Message:**  You're starting to feel confident, but avoid saying anything that suggests you believe you can actually predict the product's quality. Instead, acknowledge the pattern you've observed while still keeping your expectations realistic."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.
