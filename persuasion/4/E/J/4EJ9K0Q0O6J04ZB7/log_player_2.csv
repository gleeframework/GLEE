**Reasoning:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:**  All products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products and recommending them.
* **Potential gain outweighs risk:** Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) is significant, especially since the data points towards a higher probability of it being high quality.

**Important note:** This strategy assumes Alice is being honest and acting in good faith. If there's reason to believe she might be intentionally misleading buyers, then a more cautious approach might be warranted."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation carries weight, as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Perfect Track Record:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, buyers would consider factors like the seller's reputation, previous reviews, and their own risk tolerance."
