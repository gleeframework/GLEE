"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this product is low-quality. Since I don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products, it's impossible to know if the $1,000,000 price is a good deal for him.  It's better to recommend against buying, as there's a high risk of Bob losing money."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, thank you for the recommendation, Alice.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality. While I still don't know how much Bob values high-quality products, it's a safe bet to recommend buying.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Profit:**  There's a good chance Bob will value this high-quality product at more than $1,000,000. If he does, he'll make a profit. 
* **Worst Case Scenario:** Even if Bob values it lower than $1,000,000, he'll only lose money if he buys. He has the option to pass and avoid any loss. 
* **Building Trust:**  By recommending the high-quality product, I might start building trust with Bob, increasing the likelihood of him buying from me in future rounds."
"Bob's message: I'll take your recommendation, Alice. I'll buy this product!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality, just like the last round.  Bob bought the previous high-quality product, suggesting that he values high-quality products at least as much as $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's again a safe bet to recommend buying this high-quality product.  

Continuing to recommend high-quality products while Bob is showing a willingness to buy them is a good strategy to maximize potential profits and build a strong relationship with him."
