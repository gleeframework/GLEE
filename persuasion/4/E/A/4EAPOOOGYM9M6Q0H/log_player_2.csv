I'm willing to offer you a great deal on this product for $10000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fraction of its worth!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the price is $10,000.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products. I want to be upfront with you - I've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products lately. I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one for $10000.
