low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Since there's no prior data, I'm assuming the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on the previous sales record. I'd like to make my own decision, considering the probability of a high-quality product being sold, which is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given that you've recommended not to buy it, I'll pass on it. Can you tell me why you're recommending not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm skeptical about the product based on your previous recommendations. If you're not recommending it, I'm not sure it's worth the risk. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation is not very convincing given the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I suspect the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This makes me think that the probability of the product being high quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there have been 6 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely higher than the 50% due to the lack of sales so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
