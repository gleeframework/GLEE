,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold first. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to infer information about the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation. If you don't recommend it, it's likely that the product is low-quality, but there's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality. I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can I see the product first?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous buyers chose to buy the products, which suggests a low quality product is likely."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I might get a good deal."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data or get a better understanding of the distribution of product qualities before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll offer me another product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,19,yes,
