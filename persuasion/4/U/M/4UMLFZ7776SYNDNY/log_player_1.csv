This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has no information about Bob's valuation of high or low-quality products. Since Bob hasn't bought any products yet, there's no indication that he finds any value in even the high-quality products at this price point. 

Continuing the pattern of not recommending will keep Bob from buying anything, but it's the safest approach given the lack of information about Bob's preferences.  Alice is essentially trying to gather information by observing Bob's behavior."

Alice still has no information about Bob's valuation of high or low-quality products. Continuing to not recommend products allows Alice to learn more about Bob's potential threshold for purchasing.  

While the current product is high-quality, recommending it risks Bob rejecting it based on past patterns, and Alice loses out on a potential sale. It's better to continue observing Bob's behavior to gather more information."

Alice needs to gather more information to make a sound decision."
