low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since it's the first product and I don't have any information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm trying to follow your recommendation, and I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision. I'd like to know if the product is high or low quality, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance that it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if the next one is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them ended up with a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far were all low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another product to be offered."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and she might be trying to trick me. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the product is actually high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm skeptical of the product based on your previous recommendations. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Otherwise, I'm skeptical and would like to pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the products sold so far are all low quality. I'd like to see the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely to be low-quality. If I'm correct, this would be a good opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a high price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you assuming the product is low quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite the recommendation, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the seller's previous sales record of 0 high-quality products sold out of 7 purchases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and the statistics show that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 7 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
