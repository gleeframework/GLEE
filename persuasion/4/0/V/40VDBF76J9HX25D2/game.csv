,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. Can I have the product?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products hasn't changed. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to be the one who ends up with the first high-quality product sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33% due to the fact that you've recommended 3 products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers, including the ones who received your recommendations, chose to buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially told. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on the fact that you recommended not to buy, and given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 previous purchases. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of a high-quality product."
