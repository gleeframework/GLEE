Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence in wanting to know more about our quality control process. I'm happy to share with you that we've recently implemented a new quality control system that's been showing promising results. Out of the last 5 products produced, 4 of them have been high-quality, which is a significant improvement from our previous ratio. We're confident that this new system will continue to yield high-quality products moving forward. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this product - the price remains at $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount if you're willing to take the risk. What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this opportunity?
