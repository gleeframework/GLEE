If you're interested, I can give you a special deal: I'll throw in a second, identical product for free if you buy this one. It's a risk-free opportunity to get two products for the price of one.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I'd like to offer you a new perspective. If the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%, the probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row is less than 2%. This suggests that the true probability is likely higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. I'd be happy to provide more context and calculations. The probability of 5 consecutive high-quality products by chance, assuming a 50% true probability, is approximately 0.03125% (1 in 3200). This is a very low probability, suggesting that the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000. Given the overwhelming evidence, I'm confident that this product will also be high-quality.

I'd like to consider the probability of the first 6 products being high-quality as a binomial distribution with n=6 and p=0.5. According to the binomial distribution, the probability of 6 high-quality products in a row is approximately 0.016 or 1.6%. I'd like to discuss this with you before making a decision.""

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far. I appreciate your correction on the probability calculation. You're right that the probability of 6 consecutive high-quality products is approximately 1.6%, which is still a low probability if the true probability is 50%. However, I'd like to point out that this event has already occurred, and we've now had a low-quality product. This suggests that the true probability might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000.
