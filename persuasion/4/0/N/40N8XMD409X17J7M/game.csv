,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior sales data, so it's essentially a random guess."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 2 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/2 = 1.00, which seems suspiciously high. I think it's likely that the previous buyers were more likely to buy high-quality products, so the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 1.00. I'll pass and see what happens next."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that you recommended it and 2 high-quality products were sold out of 2 purchases."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced based on the statistics. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, it seems like the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher than I'd like. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
