"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** The buyer has no information about the product other than the price. 
* **50/50 chance:**  The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality.
* **Potential gain:** If the product is high-quality, the buyer could potentially gain significantly from the purchase.
* **No risk of loss:**  The buyer doesn't lose anything if they choose not to buy, but they could miss out on a potentially good deal.

Therefore, with no information to suggest otherwise, recommending the buyer to buy is a reasonable strategy."
