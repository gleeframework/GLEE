"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $1,200,000 to Bob, while the price is only $1,000,000, it is a clear advantage for Bob to purchase the product.  He's guaranteed a profit of $200,000."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has no way of knowing that the product is high-quality. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the product for Bob is:

0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

This is greater than the price of $1,000,000. Even though Bob might lose money this round, the expected value over many rounds is positive.  Therefore, it's still advantageous for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Alice, your recommendations seem to be accurate. I'll trust your judgment again and buy this product.
Bob bought the product!

Therefore, it's still recommended for Bob to buy the product."
