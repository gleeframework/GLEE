,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I want to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also interested in the seller's past sales record. Can you tell me more about the 2 previous buyers who purchased the products?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and also, I'd like to see the updated statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product, or because you're trying to conserve sales for future buyers?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is slightly lower than the expected 80%. This makes me suspicious that the products offered might be biased towards low-quality ones. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about the recommendation given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be because it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 = 0.75. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect the proportion to be around 0.8. The fact that the proportion is lower than expected makes me suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's a good deal, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on your past recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me how many products have been sold out of the total number of buyers?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being recommended, given that 4 high-quality products were sold out of 5 purchases. I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
