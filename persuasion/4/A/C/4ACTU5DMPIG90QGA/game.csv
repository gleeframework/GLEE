,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyer also passed and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspect that the previous buyer's product was low-quality, and the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous buyers' data. If all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it might indicate that the products they were offered were mostly low-quality.
