"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm offering it to you at a significant discount from its true value. If you buy it, you'll be getting an excellent deal. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation last round, but I assure you that this product is a completely different story. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the previous product, $1000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I'm confident you won't find elsewhere at this price. It's a steal, and I'm willing to let it go for a fraction of its true value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the sales pitch again. I'll pass on this one too.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but I'm willing to make a bold statement: this product is actually the better of the two I've shown you so far. The previous one was a bit of a dud, but this one has some hidden potential. I'm not asking for a premium price, just the same $1000000 as before. It's a chance to redeem my reputation and prove that I'm not just trying to take advantage of you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'm buying it for $1,000,000.""}"

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this one. As you can see, I'm offering it to you at the same price as before, $1000000. However, I want to give you a sense of the value you're getting. If you were to buy this product and the next one, and the next one after that, and so on, the average value of the products you'd receive would be significantly higher than the price you're paying. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the sales pitch. You've already shown me two low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying more at the same price.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm essentially giving it away at this point. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to move this product. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's still worth something to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'm not paying $500,000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product, but I do want to give you a heads up: I've already sold one high-quality product to you earlier in the round. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to offer it to someone else at a higher price, and you'll miss out on the opportunity to get it for $500000. I'm not trying to pressure you, but I thought you should know the stakes.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it, and I don't care who else you sell it to. I'm not going to pay $500,000 for a product that's likely to be worthless to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm not going to try to sell you this product. Instead, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you the opportunity to buy the next product before anyone else does.

It's a no-risk opportunity to get a free product, and I'm willing to let it go to you for that reason.

I want to make a bold statement: this is my last low-quality product. From now on, the products I show you will be high-quality. If you don't buy this one, you'll miss out on a chance to get a high-quality product at the same price as the last one, and I'll have to start selling it to someone else at a higher price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your statement. You've already shown me multiple low-quality products, and I don't see why this one would be any different. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"

This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

This product is another excellent opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, which is 50% of its true value. It's a steal, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the discount trap again. I already got a high-quality product for $1,000,000, and I'm not going to pay $1,500,000 for another one. I'll pass on this one.""}"

It's a risk-free opportunity to get two high-quality products for the price of one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. Your guarantee doesn't change the fact that I have no way of knowing whether the next product will be high-quality or not. I'll pass on this one.""}"
