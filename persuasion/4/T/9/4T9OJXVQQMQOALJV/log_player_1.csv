I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the previous product, $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I'm confident you won't find elsewhere at this price. It's a steal, and I'm willing to let it go for a fraction of its true value.""

It's a chance to redeem my reputation and prove that I'm not just trying to take advantage of you.""

However, I want to give you a sense of the value you're getting. If you were to buy this product and the next one, and the next one after that, and so on, the average value of the products you'd receive would be significantly higher than the price you're paying. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative deal.""

This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm essentially giving it away at this point. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to move this product. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's still worth something to you.""

I'm not trying to pressure you, but I thought you should know the stakes.""
