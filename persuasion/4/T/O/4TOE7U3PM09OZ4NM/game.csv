,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the probability that a product is low-quality is 66.67%. Since Alice recommended me to buy the product, I'm assuming it's likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
