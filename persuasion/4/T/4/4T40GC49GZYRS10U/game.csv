low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice didn't recommend it, which makes me suspect it might be low quality. If it's high quality, I'll be very surprised!",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you're recommending against it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the product quality distribution based on your previous sales record.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high quality or low quality. If it's high quality, it would be a great opportunity to buy a valuable product at a low price, and I'll know that the previous buyers were just unlucky. If it's low quality, I'll learn that the previous buyers were just lucky, and I'll be able to avoid wasting my money.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics on the products sold so far, and I'd like to know if there's a way to get a recommendation based on the proportion of high-quality products sold.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"Out of the 10 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. This product I'm offering now is one that I'm confident in, and I recommend it to you."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",

,,Alice,12,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 10 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality.

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 12 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. This product I'm offering now is one that I'm confident in, and I recommend it to you. It's a great opportunity to be the first buyer to receive a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",

,,Alice,14,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 13 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,15,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 14 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. I'm committed to honesty, and I don't want you to buy a product that I don't believe in. This product I'm offering now is not one that I'm confident in, and I advise against purchasing it. Please be aware that some buyers have been trying to exploit the information asymmetry by buying products that I don't recommend, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine and based on the product's quality."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 5 buyers didn't buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 15 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. This product I'm offering now is one that I'm extremely confident in, and I highly recommend it to you. I understand that the previous buyers' decisions may have raised concerns, but I assure you that this product is an exception. It's a great opportunity to be the first buyer to receive a high-quality product, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.,
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 16 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. I understand that this may raise concerns about my recommendation, but I assure you that I'm doing my best to provide accurate information. This product I'm offering now is one that I'm extremely confident in, and I highly recommend it to you. I'm willing to provide additional information or answer any questions you may have to help you make a more informed decision. Please consider that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and it's possible that the previous buyers were just unlucky."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision on the next product.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 17 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. This product I'm offering now is one that I'm extremely confident in, and I highly recommend it to you. I understand that the previous buyers' decisions may have raised concerns, but I assure you that this product is an exception. I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed frequency of high-quality products should converge to the true probability of 50% as the number of trials increases. Therefore, I believe that we are due for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 18 products sold so far, none of them were high-quality.

This product I'm offering now is one that I'm extremely confident in, and I highly recommend it to you. I understand that the previous buyers' decisions may have raised concerns, but I assure you that this product is an exception. I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed frequency of high-quality products should converge to the true probability of 50% as the number of trials increases. With only 5 buyers having purchased out of 18, the sample size is still relatively small, and I believe that we are due for a high-quality product. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it, and I'm offering you the opportunity to be the first buyer to receive a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.",

This product I'm offering now is not one that I'm confident in, and I advise against purchasing it. I apologize for any confusion or frustration caused by my previous recommendations, and I hope that you will consider my honesty in your decision."
