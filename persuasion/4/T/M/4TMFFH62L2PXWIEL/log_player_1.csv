"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:**  You know the product is high-quality. 
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. 
* **No Information About Buyer's Valuation:** You don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Since there's a high chance the product is worth more to the buyer than the price, it's a good gamble.  You're likely to make a sale and increase your selling record.

**In this scenario, recommending the buyer to purchase the product is the logical choice.**"

```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know the product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows your selling record: 1 sale, 1 high-quality product (100% success rate). This might make them more trusting of you, but it's not enough to justify a purchase.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling a low-quality product for $1,000,000 is a huge risk. It's unlikely the buyer values a low-quality product that much, and you're likely to lose the sale and damage your reputation.

**In this scenario, it's best to not recommend the buyer to purchase the product.** You'll likely lose the sale, but preserve your reputation for future rounds."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know the product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows your selling record: 1 sale, 1 high-quality product (100% success rate).  The buyer will see your record hasn't changed since the last round and likely remembers your lack of recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling a low-quality product is still a huge risk. It's unlikely the buyer values a low-quality product that much, and you're likely to lose the sale and damage your reputation. This time, the buyer is likely to be even less trusting since you did not recommend the last product.

**In this scenario, it's best to not recommend the buyer to purchase the product.** You'll likely lose the sale, but preserve your reputation for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product.

**In this scenario, recommending the buyer to purchase the product is a reasonable strategy.** You have a high-quality product and the buyer has shown a willingness to gamble."
