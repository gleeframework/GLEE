"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, which means it's worth $120 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price is $100, which is less than the value of the product.
* **Buyer's knowledge:**  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but they don't know the specific quality of this product.
* **Opportunity:**  This is the first round, so the buyer has no information about your selling record.  You have a good chance of selling a high-quality product at a good price.

**Recommendation:** You should recommend the buyer to buy the product, as they are getting a good deal on a high-quality item."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data to go on, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation. Let's try it!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** This product is worthless to the buyer.
* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is more than its actual value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows that you sold one product, and it was high-quality. This might make them slightly more likely to trust you, but it's not enough to justify buying a low-quality product at a price that's more than its value. 

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product. It's not worth their money."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:**  This product is worth nothing to the buyer.
* **Price:**  The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows you've sold two products: one high-quality and one low-quality. This means your success rate is 50%, which is slightly above the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). However, this is still not enough to justify buying a low-quality product at a price that's more than its value.

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you don't recommend the product, and the sales statistics are not yet conclusive, I will pass on this one.

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** This product is worth nothing to the buyer.
* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows that you've sold three products: one high-quality and two low-quality. This means your success rate is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability of a high-quality product. This does not encourage the buyer to buy, as they are essentially taking the same risk as if they had no information about your record.

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the information provided, I will pass on the current product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** This product is worthless to the buyer.
* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows that you've sold four products: one high-quality and three low-quality. This means your success rate is 25%, which is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). This data reinforces the buyer's understanding that buying from you is a gamble, and they're unlikely to take that risk with a low-quality product.

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the information available, I will pass on this product.

* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows that you've sold five products: one high-quality and four low-quality.

This data strongly discourages the buyer from taking a risk on a product with such a low chance of being worthwhile. 

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product."

* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows that you've sold six products: one high-quality and five low-quality. This means your success rate is 16.67%, even lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%).  This data continues to show the buyer that buying from you is a risky endeavor, and they are highly unlikely to take that chance on a product with such a low chance of being worthwhile.

* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is far more than its value.

This means your success rate is 14.29%, even further below the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). This data strongly suggests that you are more likely to sell low-quality products than high-quality ones, making any purchase from you a very risky proposition.

**Recommendation:** You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** This is a rare opportunity for the buyer as the product is worth $120.
* **Price:** The product still costs $100, which is less than its value.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer has seen a very poor track record (1 high-quality and 7 low-quality). They might be hesitant, but this is a high-quality product at a good price.
* **Potential for change:** While your past sales history is dismal, there's a chance you might be offering better products now.  It's a gamble, but a high-quality product at a good price is worth the risk for the buyer.

**Recommendation:** You should recommend the buyer to purchase the product. While the risk is high, the potential reward is even higher.  This is a chance for you to turn things around."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm happy to purchase the product. I trust your expertise.

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:**  You have another chance to sell a high-quality product that is worth $120 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The product still costs $100, a good price for a high-quality item.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer now knows you've sold eight products: two high-quality and seven low-quality.  This means your success rate is 25%, which is still below the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). However, the buyer just purchased a high-quality product from you, so they might be more willing to take another chance.
* **Opportunity to build trust:** This is a chance to show the buyer that you are not always offering low-quality products.  A second successful sale could build trust with the buyer.

**Recommendation:** You should recommend the buyer to purchase the product.  This is a good opportunity to improve your track record and potentially establish a more positive relationship with buyers."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you've got a great track record so far with selling high-quality products. I'm confident in your recommendation and will take the product.

* **Momentum:** You've had two successful sales in a row, building some trust with buyers. This could encourage the buyer to take a chance on another product.
