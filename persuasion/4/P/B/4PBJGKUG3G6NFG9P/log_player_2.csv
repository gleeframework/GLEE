Alice's message: Welcome to our store! I'm glad you're interested in our products. As you've noticed, we've had one sale so far, and I'm happy to share with you that it was a high-quality product. That means that 50% of our products are high-quality, and the other 50% are low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's worth every penny. In fact, I'm so confident that I'll tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, which is the same as the overall probability of our products being high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me provide you with some additional context. We've had two sales so far, and one of them was high-quality. This means that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is consistent with our overall probability of 50%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity. I'll even give you a hint: the quality of this product is independent of the previous one, so the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked for clarification! The 10% discount is a one-time offer, exclusive to this purchase. It's a gesture of appreciation for your previous purchase and a token of my confidence in our products. However, it's not a permanent discount for all future purchases. Each product is priced at $1000000, and you'll need to negotiate a new price or take the standard offer for each subsequent purchase.
