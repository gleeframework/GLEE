,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of a high-quality product, but I'd like to take the chance to learn more about the product's quality and potentially acquire a high-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, and I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the overall quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is any better."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 6 sold is a relatively low rate of 16.67%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products, I'm inclined to pass on this one. I'd like to know if there's a reason behind your recommendation, Alice."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1/8), I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 8 sales, the probability seems low. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
