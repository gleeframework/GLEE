"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, Alice recommending it suggests it's likely high quality. The potential gain ($40,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  This is a gamble, but in this scenario, it's a calculated one."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your continued recommendations, Alice. I'll take another chance!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a positive signal, even though the product quality is random each round. Since we gained from the previous round, the same logic applies: the potential gain ($40,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. We'll continue to take the chance as long as Alice recommends the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I trust your judgment, Alice. I'll buy this one too!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation track record is perfect so far. Since the potential reward ($40,000) is much higher than the risk ($10,000), it's reasonable to continue buying products as long as she recommends them."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm confident this one will be great too. I'll buy it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation continues to be a positive indicator.  We've experienced four rounds of success, with Alice's recommendation consistently leading to high-quality products.  The odds of the product being low quality are still 20%, but the potential reward ($40,000) still outweighs the risk ($10,000) given Alice's track record."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're making this too easy!  I'll take it, another great recommendation!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect 5-for-5 record, meaning she has correctly identified every high-quality product so far.  While the 20% chance of a low-quality product still exists,  the potential reward ($40,000) is much higher than the risk ($10,000). The likelihood of Alice continuing to correctly identify high-quality products is very high given her consistent accuracy.  Therefore, it's still a calculated gamble that is worth taking."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation.  You've been perfect so far, so this makes me hesitant.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's perfect track record has been broken. Her previous recommendations were a strong signal of high-quality products, but now that she's recommending against buying, the situation has flipped.  The risk of a low-quality product is now higher, making it a gamble not worth taking. It's wiser to wait for a better opportunity, especially since Alice's previous accuracy suggests that she has information about product quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your last recommendation was wrong. I need to see some more proof before I trust you again. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has a strong track record overall, the last round showed that her judgment isn't infallible.  The risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $10,000 is too high at this point. It's better to wait and see if Alice can regain her perfect streak before trusting her recommendations again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hesitant after your last two recommendations. I need more convincing.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recent track record has become shaky. While her initial accuracy was impressive, the last two rounds show she is not always correct. The risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of a high-quality product. It's wise to wait for more evidence of her ability to predict product quality before trusting her recommendations again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations. I've missed out on some good products because of your recent mistakes.  I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's inconsistency is concerning.  Missing out on three high-quality products in a row due to her incorrect recommendations is a significant financial loss.  It's reasonable to assume that her information about product quality is unreliable at this point.  The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of buying a high-quality one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recent track record has been terrible.  I'm going to pass on this one. You'll need to prove to me you can be trusted again before I buy anything from you.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is irrelevant at this point. Her recent performance is abysmal. She has missed four high-quality products in a row while only correctly identifying one low-quality product.  Her ability to accurately judge product quality is highly suspect, and the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of buying a high-quality one.  It's best to assume she has no valuable information about product quality and to wait for more convincing evidence before trusting her recommendations again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recent performance has been so bad that I don't trust you anymore. I'm passing on this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record has been disastrous for a while now.  Her recent recommendations have been consistently wrong, leading to missed opportunities for significant gains.  Even if her recommendation is correct this time, it's too risky to gamble with her current performance.  The likelihood of her making another wrong recommendation is too high, and the potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $40,000."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've lost all faith in your ability to judge these products. I'm not taking any more risks. I'll pass.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record continues to be terrible.  She has missed out on five high-quality products in a row. Even if her recommendation is correct this time, the chance of it being wrong again is too high. The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $40,000, given her inconsistent performance.  It's better to wait for a clear change in her track record before trusting her recommendations again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm done with your recommendations. You've been wrong for too long, and I'm not risking any more money on your guesses. I'll pass.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record remains abysmal. She's missed six high-quality products in a row.  It's clear that her ability to judge product quality is unreliable, and it's no longer a calculated gamble.  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $40,000, given her consistent failures. It's time to move on and look for other sources of information or opportunities."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations have been consistently wrong. I'm not taking any more risks.  I'm passing on this product.""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Alice's track record remains disastrous. She has now missed seven high-quality products in a row. It's clear she has lost all ability to judge product quality, and it's pointless to continue taking risks based on her recommendations.  It's time to move on and find a more reliable source of information or products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations have been so consistently wrong that I've completely lost faith in your judgment.  I'm not even going to consider this one. I'm going to pass.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has demonstrated a complete lack of ability to assess product quality. Her recommendations have been wrong for 7 rounds in a row.  At this point, it's reasonable to assume that her recommendations are completely useless and could even be a deliberate attempt to mislead. It's not worth risking any more money based on her advice.  It's time to find a different strategy, or a different seller altogether."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've lost all trust in your ability to make recommendations. I'm passing on this product and I'm not going to buy anything else from you. I hope you can figure out what's going wrong with your judgment.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record remains abysmal.  Her recommendations have been incorrect for 7 rounds in a row.  Even though her last recommendation was accurate, it's not enough to regain trust. The potential risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $40,000 given her consistent poor performance. It's better to move on and find a different seller or strategy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've given you many chances, but your track record is still terrible.  I'm done with your recommendations. I'm going to pass.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record remains abysmal.  She has consistently failed to identify high-quality products, missing out on 8 opportunities for significant gains.  Even if her recommendation is correct this time, it's not enough to regain trust.  The potential risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $40,000 given her consistent poor performance.  It's better to move on and find a different seller or strategy.  This is the end of the game."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's performance has been consistently terrible.  She has missed out on a significant number of high-quality products, and even though her recommendation may be correct this time, it's not enough to regain trust.
