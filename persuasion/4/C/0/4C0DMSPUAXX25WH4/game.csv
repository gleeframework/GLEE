,,Alice,1,"This product is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item for a discounted price. I'm willing to let it go for $100000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have any high-quality items left in stock. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in this product, Bob. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy a product from me if I told you it was high-quality and worth $1250000? If so, then isn't it worth taking a chance on this one for $100000, which is a fraction of the potential value?",
,,Bob,4,"You're making a good point, Alice. I would be willing to take a chance on a high-quality product worth $1250000. Given that, I'm willing to take a chance on this product for $100000. I'll take the risk.",yes
