As you know, I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them have been of the highest quality. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 50%. This means that there's a 50% chance you might not get the best value for your money. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that there's a chance it might not be worth that to you. Are you willing to take that risk?",
