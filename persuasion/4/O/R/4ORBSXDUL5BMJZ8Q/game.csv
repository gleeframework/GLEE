low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I know it's a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous three buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to think that the products sold to them were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the quality for myself and don't want to let the product go to waste."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product being low-quality, and I don't want to be the fifth buyer to fall for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the number of products offered to each of the previous 4 buyers."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is 0%. This is consistent with the prior probability of a product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 33.33% chance of being worth $4000000 to me, especially when I don't have any additional information that would make me think it's more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm skeptical that this one might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, which suggests that they were all low-quality products. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to pass on this opportunity. The lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation suggest that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also received the same recommendation from you and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's recommendation and the current statistics, it seems like the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
