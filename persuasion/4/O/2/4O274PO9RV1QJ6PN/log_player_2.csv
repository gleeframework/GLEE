**Reasoning:**

Since there's no historical data to go on, we have no information about the quality of Alice's products. However, as a rational buyer, we should take advantage of the fact that Alice knows the product quality and is incentivized to recommend products that would lead to a sale.  Therefore, it's a gamble, but buying the product in this case seems like the best option."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I will pass on this product.  I noticed that you only recommended one product so far and it was high-quality. I'm a bit concerned about the low rate of sales and the lack of data on the proportion of high-quality products sold. I'll wait to see how the sales progress for other buyers before making a decision.""}

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very limited information about the product itself.  The only clue is Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice wants to sell products. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable.  If she believes the product is high-quality, she'll be more likely to recommend it to maximize her profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant.  The risk of getting a low-quality product ($0) is also significant, but we have no information to suggest the product is definitely low-quality. 

**In this scenario, it's a calculated risk worth taking. Alice's recommendation, while not foolproof, is the best piece of information we have.**"
