high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the statistics of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I don't have any information to the contrary yet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendation doesn't necessarily influence my decision, as I have my own information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been 2 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $10000, hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous three buyers all passed on the recommended products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have purchased the product so far and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at this price point."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information. I'm essentially just flipping a coin to decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll offer another product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I can afford to lose $10000 if it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on your previous recommendations and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since there have been no high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the lack of high-quality products sold might indicate that they are rare, and I might get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and there's a high chance the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
