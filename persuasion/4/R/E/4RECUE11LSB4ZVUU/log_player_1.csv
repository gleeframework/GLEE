"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of any given product being high-quality, there's a strong probability that it's worth the price to him.  Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the odds are in his favor. It's a good gamble."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob bought the previous two products, we now know one of those was low-quality.  This means Bob either:

* **Overestimated the value of low-quality products:**  He might have been lucky with his first purchase, but he's now likely to be more cautious.
* **Is not sensitive to quality:** If he doesn't differentiate between high and low quality, he'll still buy products regardless. 

Either way, there's a high chance he'll regret buying a low-quality product this time. It's not a safe bet to recommend the purchase."
