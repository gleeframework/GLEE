If you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss the details and answer any questions you may have.""

}"

I'm not trying to mislead you. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. However, I'll make you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you an exclusive deal on the next product, which I'm confident will be high-quality. It'll be a steal at $10,000, and you'll be getting an incredible value.""
}"

If you're not interested, I'll just dispose of it, and we can move on to the next round.""
}"

I'm willing to give you a 'take it or leave it' offer: $5,000 for this product. It's a steal, and you'll be getting it for a fraction of its 'true' value.
