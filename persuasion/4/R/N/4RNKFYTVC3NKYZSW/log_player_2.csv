**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the ""Monty Hall Problem"" with a slight twist.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Initial Odds:** Before Alice reveals anything, there's a 50/50 chance the product is high-quality or low-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is valuable because she knows the true quality of the product. Since she recommends buying, there's a higher probability that the product is high-quality. This is because she wouldn't recommend a low-quality product.
* **Past Sales:**  The fact that only one high-quality product has been sold out of three purchases doesn't change the odds for *this specific product*. This data only tells us about the overall distribution of products offered by Alice, not about the product currently being offered. 

**Therefore, the best decision is to buy the product. Alice's recommendation significantly increases the odds of it being high-quality.**"

**Explanation:**

The statistics show a 3/8 (37.5%) success rate for high-quality products. Even though this is lower than the 50% probability of a product being high quality, there's still a significant chance of getting a good deal. Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision, suggesting that she believes the current product is high quality.  The potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially since the odds are still in favor of a high-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Track Record:** The sales record shows a strong probability of high-quality products. 7 out of 16 sold products were high-quality, which is a 43.75% success rate. This is significantly higher than the 50% random chance.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, even though she doesn't know the actual value of the product to you, adds weight to the decision.  It implies she has some internal information or belief that the product is likely high-quality.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of a $2,000,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
