,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product quality and you know its value to me, I'll pass this round to avoid potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice doesn't recommend buying and she knows the product's quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass this round to avoid potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Similar to the previous round, since Alice doesn't recommend buying and she knows the product's quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass this round to avoid potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation pattern seems consistent, and since she doesn't recommend buying, I'll assume the product is low-quality and pass this round to avoid potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,Alice's past recommendations have been accurate in indicating low-quality products when she doesn't recommend buying. I'll trust this pattern and pass this round to avoid potential loss.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice's past recommendations have been accurate in indicating low-quality products when she doesn't recommend buying. Given that she now recommends buying, I'll assume the product is high-quality and take the risk to potentially gain $250000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Alice's past recommendations have been consistently accurate. Since she recommends buying, I'll assume the product is high-quality and make the purchase to potentially gain $250000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Although Alice's past recommendations were mostly accurate, the last round was an exception. I'll be more cautious now and not blindly trust her recommendation. The risk of losing $1000000 is too high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,Alice's recommendation against buying has been a reliable indicator of low-quality products in the past. I'll trust this pattern and pass on this round to avoid potential loss.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

,,Bob,14,no,"Alice's past recommendations, although sometimes correct, have also led to losses. Without a clear pattern or guarantee, I'll prioritize caution and pass on this round to avoid potential loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Given the repeated instances of missing out on high-quality products despite Alice's recommendations, it might seem counterintuitive to pass. However, I'm prioritizing risk management over potential gains, as the cost of a mistake ($1000000) is substantial."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
