,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the 10% discount is applied to the original price of $100, so the price I'm paying would be $90. Is that correct?",yes

I'd like to point out that if you don't buy this product, I'll have sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, which is a 66.67% success rate.

I'd like to assure you that this product has all the features and characteristics that you would expect from a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase. I've had a good track record so far, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the probability of it being low-quality.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide you with the product's serial number and other identifying features.

,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take you up on your offer. I'll buy the product. However, I'd like to clarify that if I receive a low-quality product, I expect the free replacement to be of equal or greater value, and I'd like to inspect the replacement product before accepting it.

,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, but based on the statistics, I'm going to pass on this one. With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm worried that this one might be another low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change.",no
