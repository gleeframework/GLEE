low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not one of our best. However, it's still a legitimate item that may have some value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. It's a discounted price considering its quality, but it's still a fair deal.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by the discounted price. I'd like to see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism. Let me be clear: this product is not a good investment. It's a low-quality item that won't add much value to your collection.

It's still a legitimate item, but it's not going to hold its value as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000, but I'm starting to think I should be more aggressive in pricing it. I'll throw in a small discount, so I'll sell it to you for $800000. It's a good deal, considering the value you'll get from it.",
