high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling a low-quality product to a buyer who would not buy it, increasing the chances of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer who would buy it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first two buyers bought the products, and it's likely that the first product was high-quality, which would have encouraged the second buyer to buy. However, I don't have any information about the quality of the first product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the prior probability of 0.8. I'm going to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will be more likely to buy it."
