,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that they were all low-quality products. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better experience."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
