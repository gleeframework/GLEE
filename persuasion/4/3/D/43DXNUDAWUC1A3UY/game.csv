low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to form my own opinion based on the statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers also passed on the high-quality products, which makes me suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product. Alice's recommendation also aligns with this assessment. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure I trust Alice's recommendation, but based on the statistics, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on the current product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the products recommended by you, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on the product and see if you'll offer it to the next buyer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record and your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about its quality. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm essentially buying a 33.33% chance of a $40000 gain and a 66.67% chance of a $0 loss. I'm hoping that this product will be the first high-quality one sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth buying?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may not have a reliable method for determining the quality of the product. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is 0, which is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. This suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality, making it more likely that the current product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, which have all been low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the product despite Alice's recommendation, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
