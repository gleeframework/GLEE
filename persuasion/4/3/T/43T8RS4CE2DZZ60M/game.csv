,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a good deal and take advantage of the lack of information about the product's quality."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you're concerned about the low sales of high-quality products or something else?"

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 4 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0. I'm going to pass and see if you'll recommend a different product to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward of $4000000 is substantial. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to pass on the product and not risk wasting my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product, it is likely that the product is low quality. Since there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is low.
