  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my belief. Let's calculate the posterior probability of the product being high-quality given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3. P(H|1/3) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 2/3 * (1-0.8)) = 1/3 / (1/3 + 2/3 * 0.2) = 1/3 / (1/3 + 0.4/3) = 1/3 / (1.4/3) = 1/1.4 = 10/14 = 5/7. The posterior probability of the product being high-quality is 5/7, which is less than the prior probability of 0.8. I'll pass on the product.""
