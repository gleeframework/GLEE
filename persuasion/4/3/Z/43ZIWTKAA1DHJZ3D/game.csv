high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I assure you it's worth the $100 price tag. I have a track record of selling mostly high-quality products, and this one is no exception. You can trust my judgment and make a purchase with confidence.",
,,the buyer,1,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold, based on your previous sales record?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Although my sales record is still building, I can tell you that so far, 1 out of 1 products I've offered has been high-quality. You have a chance to get a great product here. Will you take it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy it, but I'm aware that the current sample size is very small. I'd like to discuss the possibility of you offering more products so I can get a better sense of the overall quality.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"My current record stands at 2 high-quality products out of 2 offered, with 1 sale made so far. The trend is looking good, and I assure you this product continues that trend. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Here are the stats: 4 high-quality products in a row, with 3 sales made. No low-quality products have been offered yet. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 80%, and I'm confident this one will meet your expectations. Want to make it 4 sales in a row?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm concerned that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%, and the fact that no low-quality products have been sold yet might be a result of selection bias. I'd like to pass on this one and see if a low-quality product shows up in the next round.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand the previous buyer's concerns, but I can assure you that my products are genuinely high-quality most of the time.

Perhaps this is just a streak of good luck, but I'm confident this product will satisfy your needs. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the chance, but I'd like to know, what's the probability of a low-quality product being offered next, based on the current statistics?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"The stats now stand: 6 high-quality products in a row, with 4 sales made. No low-quality products have been offered yet. As for the probability of a low-quality product being offered next, it's still 20% according to the original probability. The previous results don't change the underlying probability, but they do show that I've had a good run so far. Will you join the list of satisfied customers?",

,,Alice,8,"The streak continues! 7 high-quality products in a row, with 5 sales made. No low-quality products have been offered yet. I'm starting to think I might just beat the odds, but the probability of a low-quality product being offered next is still 20%. Want to ride the wave of good fortune?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the probability of a low-quality product being offered is still 20%. I'm hoping to be the exception to the streak.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"8 high-quality products in a row, with 6 sales made. No low-quality products have been offered yet. It's getting harder to believe that the 20% chance of a low-quality product hasn't shown up yet, but I'm not complaining! Want to be part of this remarkable run?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm happy to be part of this streak, but I'd like to know if there's a catch. I'm assuming the probability of a low-quality product hasn't changed, so I'm taking a calculated risk. I'll take the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could remind me that I'm not naive and that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%.",yes

If you're willing to take the same chance, I assure you this product is also high-quality. No catch, just a remarkable streak!",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced. A 9-product streak is impressive, but it's still possible that the first 8 products were all high-quality and the 9th was low-quality. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to confirm the probability of a low-quality product.",no

,,Alice,12,"11 high-quality products in a row, with 8 sales made. No low-quality products have been offered yet. As for your question, if you had passed on the product, I would have offered it to the next buyer. I don't discard products, so someone else would have had the chance to purchase it. But I'm glad you decided to take it! Now, are you ready for the next buyer to make a decision? This product is also high-quality, and I'm hoping to keep the streak going.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm glad to hear the streak is still going, but I'm a bit concerned that 11 in a row is suspiciously high. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the total number of products you've offered so far.",yes

The probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 80%, but I understand your desire to scrutinize the stats. Given the streak, some might argue that the probability hasn't changed, while others might think it's due for a correction. I'll let you decide what to make of it. Want to take a chance on this product?",
