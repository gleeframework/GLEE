,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, even without any prior information. I understand that I might get a low-quality product, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations given that none of the previous products were high-quality. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations, and I want to see for myself whether the product is high-quality or low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me how many total products have been offered so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the high probability of low-quality products and the lack of sold high-quality products, I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on your recommendation and the statistics. However, I'd like to know what made you recommend against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous buyers were all given low-quality products and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the products sold so far are all low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the next product will also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous buyers didn't buy after her recommendations."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers, who were recommended to buy, ended up with low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average, and I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which suggests a very high chance of the product being low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see the next product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
