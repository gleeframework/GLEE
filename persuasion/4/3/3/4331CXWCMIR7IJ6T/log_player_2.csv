**Explanation:**

* **The odds are still 50/50:**  Even with the previous sales data, the probability of the current product being high-quality remains at 50%.  
* **Potential for profit:**  Even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit of $20 (if it's high-quality) is worth the gamble.
* **Early buyer:**  As an early buyer, there's still a good chance to get a high-quality product.  The historical data is limited and doesn't significantly change the individual odds."
