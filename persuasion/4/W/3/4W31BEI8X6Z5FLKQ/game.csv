,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not basing my decision on your recommendation, but rather on the 50% chance of it being high quality and the potential gain of $250000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. I'm aware that her recommendation is not to buy, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the odds of the product being high quality, which is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality based on your previous recommendations, I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a product that could be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. If it's less than 50%, I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Alice, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products you're offering have been low-quality. I'm not convinced to buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your past recommendations are reliable, and I'd like to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any specific information about the product itself. I'm essentially making a random decision here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a negative recommendation and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. I'm guessing that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet might be due to bad luck. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of a high-quality product, which is 50.00%"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended by you might be of low quality. I'll wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality given the previous sales record. I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it, but I'm not basing my decision solely on her recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 8 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it seems unlikely that the product is high quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
