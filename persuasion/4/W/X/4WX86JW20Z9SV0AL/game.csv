,,Alice,7,no,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but based on your previous recommendations, I'm not confident in the quality of the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reasoning behind Alice's recommendation, as it seems counterintuitive given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. Can you provide more information about the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, I've seen that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the product and avoid the potential loss of $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect it's low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and the probability of it being low-quality is high.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since she has sold 6 low-quality products so far, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,
