Here's the reasoning:

* **No Information Disadvantage:**  As the seller, you don't know the buyer's individual valuation of high vs. low-quality products.  This means you have no basis to believe a buyer would be more or less likely to buy a low-quality product.
* **Reputation:**  You've established a perfect record so far. While the buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, they do know your overall sales history.  Continuing to recommend purchases maintains your reputation and might increase the chance of future sales.
* **Risk-Averse:**  Even if the buyer had access to your internal information about the quality of the current product, they might still choose to buy it. It's a gamble, but a gamble with a 80% chance of success. 

In short, there's no reason to break from the established pattern.  The buyer knows the odds are in their favor, even if they don't know the specific quality of this product."
