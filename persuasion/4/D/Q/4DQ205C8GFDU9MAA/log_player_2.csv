**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she's likely offering a high-quality product.
* **Previous Sales:** Only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 sale, suggesting a higher chance of a high-quality product in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a greater chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($12,000).

It's a gamble, but the odds seem slightly in your favor given Alice's recommendation and the previous sales record."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** While the sample size is small (only 2 previous buyers), the fact that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality is a positive sign. This indicates that Alice's recommendations might be reliable, at least to some extent.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a further positive signal.  Even if she doesn't always have perfect information, she has shown some ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($12,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on limited information and a significant amount of risk.  The chances of getting a low-quality product are still high, but the available data points to a slightly better than random chance of success."
