**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, even though it's based on limited information, further strengthens the likelihood of a good product. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are in favor of a positive outcome."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The seller has a 100% success rate so far, with all recommended products being high quality.
* **Limited Information:** While we don't know the overall quality distribution, the seller's perfect track record strongly suggests the current product is likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of $0 for a low-quality product, especially with the seller's track record."
