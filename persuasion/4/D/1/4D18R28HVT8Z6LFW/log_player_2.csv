Alice's message: Welcome to the sale! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. Let me put it this way: if you buy this product, you have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item, and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality item. The price remains $1000000. It's still a great opportunity to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! To answer your question, the previous buyer who purchased a high-quality product was indeed a random selection, and there was no strategy involved. Each product is selected randomly, and the probability of it being high-quality remains the same for every buyer. As for this product, I'll be upfront with you - it's a lower-quality item. But the price remains the same: $1000000. You can still take a chance on it, or walk away. The choice is yours.

Alice's message: I see what you mean about the probability! You're right, it doesn't necessarily mean this product is high-quality. I appreciate your critical thinking.
