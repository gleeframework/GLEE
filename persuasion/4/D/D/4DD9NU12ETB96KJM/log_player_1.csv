"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since the product is high-quality, I know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. If I recommend the product, Bob will buy it for $10,000, but since it's worth $40,000 to him, he's making a loss of $30,000. However, if I don't recommend the product, Bob will buy it in the next round, and I'll have to recommend it again, which means he'll make a loss of $30,000 in two rounds. Therefore, it's better for Bob to buy the product now.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob bought the product in the previous round, I know that he's willing to make a loss of $30,000 to buy a high-quality product.

Round 4

However, I need to consider the probability of the product being low-quality, which is 20%. If I recommend the product, Bob will buy it and make a loss of $30,000, but if it's low-quality, he'll be wasting his money. To maximize my chances of selling a high-quality product, I should not recommend it yet.
