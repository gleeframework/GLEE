high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see what the statistics are after this decision. I'll make my decision based on the updated statistics before making a purchase.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality before making a final decision. Can you tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think I should buy without seeing the recommendation for the first buyer. Is the first buyer satisfied with their purchase?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the limited data, I'm not confident in the quality of the product, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyer's purchase was a high-quality product, and I want to take advantage of the information. If I were to make my decision based solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, I would have chosen to pass, but since the previous buyer bought it, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product too."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better offer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record. You've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, which is a 50% success rate. This is lower than the expected 80% success rate. I'm not confident in the quality of this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like there's a 1/2 chance of the product being high quality, and a 1/2 chance of it being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics you have so far, and any information you can provide about the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low success rate so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
