  ""message"": ""I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Given the 100% success rate of my previous sales, I think it's a safe bet that this product will be worth the price. Plus, I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $10,000 to you, I'll give you a refund for the difference.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've had a 100% success rate so far, I'm aware that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality. Given the true quality of the product is revealed to you, your guarantee is essentially meaningless because you know its quality beforehand. Your past success rate doesn't influence the quality of the current product, and since you are trying to sell it, I have no way to verify if it's truly high quality. Therefore, I'll pass.
