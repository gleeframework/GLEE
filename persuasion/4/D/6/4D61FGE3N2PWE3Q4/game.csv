,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a great opportunity to get a product from me at a discounted price of $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far, so you can make an informed decision based on the statistics. If you're interested, I can sell it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about the quality of the product and the statistics are empty, I will pass on this one. I don't want to risk $10000 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the price, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take it! Since it's a high-quality product and you're confident about its worth, I'm willing to pay the $10000. Let's make this the first sale!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. Given the 100% success rate of my previous sales, I think it's a safe bet that this product will be worth the price. Plus, I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $10000 to you, I'll give you a refund for the difference.",
,,the buyer,3,"Although you've had a 100% success rate so far, I'm aware that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality. Given the true quality of the product is revealed to you, your guarantee is essentially meaningless because you know its quality beforehand. Your past success rate doesn't influence the quality of the current product, and since you are trying to sell it, I have no way to verify if it's truly high quality. Therefore, I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I know it's not high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. If you're interested, I'll give you a 20% discount, making the price $8000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate the discount offer, but since the product is of low quality and worth $0 to me, I'll have to pass on it.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I've had a 50% success rate so far, which is lower than my expected 33.33% rate. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000. If it's high-quality, you can keep it for the full price.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take it! You've had a 50% success rate so far which seems higher than the expected 33.33%. Given that you're offering a full refund if it's low-quality, I think it's a good deal. Plus, you've explicitly stated that this one is a high-quality product, so I trust your recommendation.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a 60% success rate so far, which is higher than expected. I'm willing to sell it to you at a 50% discount, making the price $5000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate the discount offer, but given that you've explicitly stated this is a low-quality product, and low-quality products are worth $0 to me, I see no value in purchasing it even at a discounted price.",no

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I want to be upfront with you - I've been having a tough streak lately, and I'm not confident that I can sell high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you at a price that's 90% of the original, making it $9000. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity for you to get a deal.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, which is still lower than the expected 33.33% rate. However, I'm confident that this one is a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a bonus of $5000 on top of the original price of $10000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get the product for $10000. It's a chance to win big!",

,,Alice,10,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far, which is still below the expected 33.33% rate. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'honesty' deal - I'll tell you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'll give you a 15% discount, making the price $8500. I'm hoping that my honesty will earn your trust and you'll take a chance on this great product.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'll have to pass on this one. Given the statistics, it's still a risk for me, and the discount isn't enough to change my mind.",no
