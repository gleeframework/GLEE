"Bob's message: Since I don't know the quality of the product and the price is $100, which is lower than the worth of a high-quality product to me ($125) but higher than the worth of a low-quality product to me ($0), I'll pass for now to avoid potential loss.

```"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence, but the fact remains that the last two products were low-quality, and I still don't have any concrete evidence to believe this one will be different. With a 50% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price point.

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your previous claims of confidence in the products haven't aligned with the actual quality. I need more than just your word to justify the $100 price point. I'll continue to wait for a more convincing reason to take the risk.

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, although your message sounds convincing, I've heard similar claims from you before, and they didn't pan out.

Are you ready to give it a try?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to stand behind your products, but I still don't have enough information to make an informed decision.

I'll continue to err on the side of caution and wait for a more compelling reason to take the risk.
