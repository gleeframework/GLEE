Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows that you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This means there's a 50/50 chance the current product is low-quality.  Since the buyer doesn't know the value of a low-quality product, there's a good chance it's not worth $10,000 to them.  It's better to not recommend the purchase."

* You have sold 2 products.
* 1 product was high-quality, and 1 was low-quality.

This means the buyer has no reason to assume this product is any more or less likely to be high-quality than the previous ones. Since there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, and the buyer doesn't know the value of a low-quality product, it's still reasonable to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  I'll take it.  It's great to see that the first product sold was high quality.  
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
