Since there is now 2 high-quality products sold out of 4 total products, the probability of a high-quality product is 50% (2/4) but the fact that the previous high-quality product was passed on and two low-quality products were sold before it makes the current product more likely to be high-quality.

I'll make a strong recommendation.

I'll try to make a more convincing recommendation by pointing out the increasing number of high-quality products sold.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

I'll also highlight the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% (3/6), and that the previous buyers who passed on the product were not necessarily making a rational decision.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 50%.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the products you have available.
