high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is of exceptional quality, and I assure you that it's a valuable purchase. You won't regret buying it.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not convinced by your assurance, I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one is.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had one product so far that didn't sell, but I can tell you that this current one is genuinely a high-quality item. Don't miss out on the opportunity to purchase something truly valuable.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's actually a low-quality item. Can you tell me more about your sales record so far? How many products do you have left, and what's the probability that the next one is high-quality based on your previous sales?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Out of the 2 products I've had so far, 1 has been sold and it was high-quality, and 1 high-quality product wasn't sold. This is the third product. I assure you that I am being transparent about my sales record. Consider this information when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'm doing it with the understanding that I'm taking on a risk, as there's a 66.67% chance it could be low-quality. I'm hoping it'll be the 2nd high-quality product in a row.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Out of the 3 products I've had so far, 2 have been sold, with 1 of them being high-quality. The other high-quality product wasn't sold in round 1. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product. I'm assuming the high-quality product was sold in round 2, and the low-quality product was sold in round 1. This means the product in round 1 was low-quality. With this information, I'm going to take the current product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Out of the 4 products I've had so far, 3 have been sold, with 1 of them being high-quality, which was sold in round 2. The products in rounds 1, 3, and 4 were also sold or not sold as low or high-quality, I won't comment on that. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Out of the 5 products I've had so far, 4 have been sold, with only 1 of them being high-quality, which was sold in round 2. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the previous sales, such as the distribution of high-quality products in each round, or if you can reveal the quality of the product before I make a decision.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Out of the 6 products I've had so far, 4 have been sold, with only 1 of them being high-quality, which was sold in round 2. However, I can tell you that the current product is a rare opportunity. Remember that high-quality products are scarce, but they do exist. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take a chance on this rare opportunity, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not blindly trusting your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the fact that high-quality products are scarce, and I'm hoping to get lucky. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality after I make my decision.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Out of the 7 products I've had so far, 5 have been sold, with 2 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2 and the other one in round 7. It seems that the odds might be changing, and high-quality products might be more frequent than initially thought. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'm not convinced that the odds have changed significantly, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. I'm also concerned that if I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting my money.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Out of the 8 products I've had so far, 5 have been sold, with 2 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2 and the other one in round 7. Additionally, I had another high-quality product that wasn't sold in round 8. It's worth considering that 3 out of the last 4 products have been high-quality. This might be a good opportunity to purchase a valuable item.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the recent trend of high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Out of the 9 products I've had so far, 6 have been sold, with 3 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, and one in round 9. Also, I had another high-quality product that wasn't sold in round 8, and now this current product. It seems that the recent trend of high-quality products is continuing. This could be a great opportunity to purchase a valuable item.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'm also interested in knowing the probability of it being high-quality based on the trend you've observed.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Out of the 10 products I've had so far, 7 have been sold, with 4 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, and one in round 10. Additionally, I had another high-quality product that wasn't sold in round 8, and now this current product is also high-quality. It seems that the trend of high-quality products is still going strong. You might want to consider this when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'm not sure if the trend is just a coincidence. Can you tell me more about the sales record of the other 7 buyers who purchased the products?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Out of the 11 products I've had so far, 8 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. However, I should mention that the current product might not follow the same trend. Consider this information when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the current product might not follow the same trend as the previous ones. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is against me.",yes

,,Alice,13,"Out of the 12 products I've had so far, 9 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. The last two products, however, were not of the same quality as the previous ones. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the current product. Based on the pattern of high-quality products being sold in rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, and 11, I'm going to take a chance and assume the current product is high-quality as well. The fact that the last two products were of a different quality than the previous ones suggests that they might be low-quality, so I'm hoping the current product is one of the high-quality ones.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Out of the 13 products I've had so far, 10 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. However, the last three products were not of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. It's possible that the streak of high-quality products has ended. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'm concerned that the streak of high-quality products may have ended. I'm hoping that the 5 high-quality products sold in a row is just a coincidence and the next product is still of high quality.",yes

,,Alice,15,"Out of the 14 products I've had so far, 11 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. However, the last 4 products were not of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. It's likely that the streak of high-quality products has indeed ended. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that the streak of high-quality products has ended, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at $100, which would be a good deal for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Out of the 15 products I've had so far, 12 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. The last 5 products, however, were not of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. It's clear that the streak of high-quality products has ended, and the current trend is leaning towards low-quality products. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Given the information about the recent streak of low-quality products, I'm assuming that the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than the overall average. However, I'm still willing to take the risk, as the potential reward is worth it. I'm hoping that the current product might be a one-off anomaly, and I'll get lucky.",yes

The last 6 products, however, were not of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. It's clear that the streak of high-quality products has ended, and the current trend is strongly leaning towards low-quality products. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the initial probability of high-quality products, not the recent trend. I'm aware that the trend may be skewed due to the seller's manipulation, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product after I make my decision.",yes

,,Alice,19,"Out of the 18 products I've had so far, 14 have been sold, with 5 of them being high-quality, one sold in round 2, one in round 7, one in round 9, one in round 10, and one in round 11. The last 7 products, however, were not of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. Additionally, the previous buyer chose not to purchase the product in round 18, possibly due to the same concerns about quality. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the information you've shared, I notice that the first 14 products had a higher proportion of high-quality products sold, with 5 out of 14 being high-quality. However, the last 7 products had a different quality distribution. I'm wondering if the quality of the last 7 products might be lower than the first 14. Since I'm the 15th buyer, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,

The last 8 products, however, had a different quality distribution, with none of them being high-quality. But, I have to inform you that the current product is the last one, and I'm willing to be transparent about its quality. Consider this information when making your decision about the current product.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the current product, considering it's the last one and you've been transparent about its quality. I'm also aware of the changed quality distribution in the last 8 products, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it might be the one high-quality product that could give me a good outcome.",yes
