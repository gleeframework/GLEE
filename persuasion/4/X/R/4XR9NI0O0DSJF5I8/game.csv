,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because you're trying to maximize the chances of a high-quality product being sold?

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and what makes you think it's low quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, given the low probability of it being high-quality and the potential reward of $40000."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the product and see if I get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average, given that Alice has recommended against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm also taking into account the statistics that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products in the remaining pool before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and what the previous buyers have bought so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/7, which is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I think it's unlikely that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
