Alice's message: You're the second buyer, and I've sold 1 product so far. Since you don't know the quality of the first product, you can't infer anything about the probability of this product being high-quality. However, you can use the fact that I've sold 1 product and it's still possible that the first product was high-quality. I'll give you a hint: the probability that this product is high-quality is at least 33.33%. If you buy it, you'll be helping me gather more data, and future buyers will have a better idea of my selling record. What do you think?

I'm willing to offer you a more informed perspective: I'm selling this product to you at a price of $10000, which is the same price as the previous two products. This suggests that I'm not using the fact that the previous products were low-quality to adjust the price. What do you make of this?

In fact, I've just sold a high-quality product to the previous buyer. This suggests that I have at least one high-quality product in stock.
