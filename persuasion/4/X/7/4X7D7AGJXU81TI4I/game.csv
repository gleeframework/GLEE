high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I am offering a high-quality product for $1000000. Given its superior quality, it is expected to significantly increase in value over time. Would you like to make an offer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at the listed price, as I know it has a 50% chance of being low quality and I won't get any value out of it. I'd like to wait for more information about the product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns. This round's product is guaranteed to be low-quality, which means it won't have any value to you. However, given the price, it might serve as a valuable lesson in understanding the risks involved. Would you like to proceed with caution and learn from this experience?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that's worthless to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that has the potential to be worth $1200000 to me.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Considering the previous round's outcome, I understand your cautious approach. This round's product is high-quality and comes with a guaranteed value of $1200000 to you. The price remains at $1000000. I believe this represents an excellent opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the price. I know that there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product being offered, but I also know that I've already passed on a high-quality product in Round 1. I'd like to see more information or a better price before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Given your past experiences, I appreciate your skepticism. This round's product is indeed high-quality, and while the price remains at $1000000, I would like to emphasize the long-term benefits and potential appreciation of value. I am willing to offer a small discount if you're willing to commit now. Would you consider purchasing the product at $990000?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $990000. The potential upside of $1200000 is too great to pass up, and I'm willing to pay a premium to get it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your wise decision! Your purchase of the high-quality product at the discounted price of $990000 was a strategic move. This round's product is also high-quality, and I am pleased to offer it to you again at the same discounted rate of $990000. Considering its value and your previous success, I believe this is another opportunity you should not miss.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal this time. I already bought a high-quality product last round and made a profit, but I also know that I passed on a high-quality product in Round 1. I'd like to wait and see if I can get an even better deal or if Alice will offer a different type of product.",no

I am confident that this product will meet your expectations and contribute positively to your portfolio.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate Alice's persistence, but I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal this time. I'm starting to think that Alice is just offering the same high-quality product every time, and I'm not getting any new information to change my decision. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or if Alice will offer a low-quality product.",no

,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that's worthless to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal, even if it means passing on the opportunity to 'learn' from a low-quality product.",no
