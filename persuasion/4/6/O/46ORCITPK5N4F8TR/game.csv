low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the first buyer, so I don't have any prior information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product, and since there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, I'll take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products Alice has been offering have been low-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to maximize my expected value based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm going to pass on it. I think you're trying to get rid of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the products Alice has been offering are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality given the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is 1/5. However, since the probability of a product being high quality is 1/3, the probability that the product is high quality given that it has not been sold is 1/2. Therefore, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 6th buyer and there's a good chance that Alice has a high-quality product left, and I want to take advantage of that. I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have passed on the product before, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems likely that this product is low-quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer will get a better product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a potential high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm worried that this one might also be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to take into account the fact that you don't know the true value of the product to me, and that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the chance to possibly get a high-quality product, given the lack of sales so far."
