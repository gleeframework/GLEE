low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and hope to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products to me, which might be overrepresented in the unsold products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the previous buyers were all sold low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I don't want to let it go to waste."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood that this product is also low quality. I don't want to spend $100 on something that's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
