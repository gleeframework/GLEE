,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low sample size and the fact that Alice's recommendation is based on incomplete data. I'd like to see more sales and recommendations before making a decision.",

,,Alice,7,yes,,"Out of the 6 previous products, 1 was sold and 5 weren't, but I can assure you that all 6 were high-quality, and this one is also high-quality. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and my personal recommendation is based on the fact that this product meets that standard."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Considering that all 7 previous products were high-quality, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I highly recommend it."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product offered, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the 80% chance I was initially told. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I assure you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. Out of the 15 previous products, 11 were high-quality. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I highly recommend this product."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because you think it's low quality or is it just a neutral recommendation?",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I highly recommend this product because I know it's high-quality. Out of the 18 previous products, 13 were high-quality. I want to assure you that this product meets the high-quality standard and I'm confident in its quality."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"This is the last round, and I assure you that this product is high-quality. Out of the 19 previous products, 14 were high-quality. Although the sales record may not reflect it, I've consistently recommended high-quality products, and I'm confident in this one. If you don't buy it, you'll miss the opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price of $1000000, which is lower than its true value of $1250000."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision with only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,
