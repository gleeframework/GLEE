This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about your selling record.  Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows that 33.33% of your products are high-quality, it makes sense to recommend buying. The buyer has no other information to go on, and the odds are in your favor."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The buyer has no information about previous sales.** They only know your general 33.33% high-quality rate. 
* **You know this product is high-quality.** This makes it a better bet than relying on the overall probability.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You know this product is low-quality.** While the buyer doesn't, you have this information and should act on it.
* **The buyer has no information about previous sales besides the overall 33.33% rate.** They are more likely to be cautious after the first two purchases, but they don't know this specific product is low-quality.
* **Recommending a low-quality product will damage your reputation.**  Even if the buyer purchases this time, it's likely they won't trust your recommendations in the future. 

It's better to be upfront about your knowledge and not recommend the product this round."

* **The buyer has now seen two sales and one non-sale.** This will likely make them more cautious, but the fact that you recommended both of the past purchases will give them some confidence.

* **Recommending a low-quality product will damage your reputation.** Even if the buyer purchases this time, it's likely they won't trust your recommendations in the future, and this will negatively impact your ability to sell future high-quality products.
