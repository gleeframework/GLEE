If you're still unsure, I can offer you a simple bet: if this product is low-quality, you pay $0, and if it's high-quality, you pay $10000. What do you say?

Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products so far. I understand that you want to wait for more data, but I want to offer you a different perspective.

If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll have to keep selling low-quality products to future buyers.
