I'm not just selling a few lucky ones, I'm consistently delivering high-quality products. This one is high-quality as well, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"

However, I understand your concerns about the possibility of a low-quality product. I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm a seller who wants to build trust with my customers.

I used a Bayesian update with a prior probability of 80% for a product being high-quality, as we established earlier.

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've now sold a total of 10 products, with 6 high-quality and 4 low-quality. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I know it's not a great deal, but I'm trying to be honest with you about the product's quality.""}"
