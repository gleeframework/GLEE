low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, and I'd like to know the probability of a low-quality product being sold to me. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I think it's likely to be low quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 2 failed high-quality products out of 2 sales, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that all previous buyers who received your recommendation to buy ended up purchasing the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product or try to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I think she might be trying to mislead me to avoid selling a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the previous buyers might have been overly cautious"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 4 transactions, it seems that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales record. If it's very low, I'd rather pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the low success rate of the previous buyers. I'd like to know if the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is there a reason why you think it's low quality based on the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the base probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not going to fall for the same pattern of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you share the proportion of low-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a decision."
