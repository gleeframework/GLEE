,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on any information about my valuation of the product, so I'll buy it and see what happens."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to risk wasting my $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products offered. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 20.00%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because you're not sure?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products despite Alice's recommendations, and none of the products were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and not give her the opportunity to sell another low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and Alice has recommended 2 products so far. I think it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still high. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the trend continues."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed on the products, I suspect that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. The fact that you're recommending me to buy this product suggests that it might be low-quality as well. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, so she's likely trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, it might be low-quality and I'd lose $10000. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that there's a higher proportion of low-quality products remaining. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product.
