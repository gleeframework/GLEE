This service is not publicly available, and I'm only offering it to you as a valued customer. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Round 7
Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great decision on the previous product! I'm glad you found the Quality Certification reassuring.

This guarantee is in addition to the standard warranty. The price remains at $1000000, and I believe this guarantee will give you the peace of mind you need to make a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the 'Quality Guarantee', I'm still cautious. The Quality Certification process being rigorous and not a guarantee of quality raises concerns.  I'm not comfortable relying solely on your personal guarantee.

I'm willing to offer you a 'Preferred Customer' status, which includes a 20% discount on all future purchases, a dedicated customer service representative, and priority access to new products. I believe this is a one-time offer, and I'd like to extend it to you for this product as well.
