**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have information about one previous buyer. This isn't enough to establish a strong pattern or predict the quality of the current product.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice has an incentive to recommend products, even if they are low quality, because she earns a fixed price regardless of the product's quality. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product is: (1/3) * $40,000 + (2/3) * $0 = $13,333.33. This is greater than the price of $10,000, making the purchase potentially worthwhile despite the risk.

**Decision:**  While there is a high risk of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product justifies taking the chance."
