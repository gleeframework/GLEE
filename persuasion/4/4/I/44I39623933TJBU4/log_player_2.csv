Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product from a reputable seller! With a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, I'm confident that this one is a gem. Don't miss out on this chance to get a product worth $2000000! The price is $1000000, a steal considering the potential value. I'm willing to take on all the risk, and I'm sure you won't regret this decision. Will you take the chance and buy this product?

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the chance and buying the previous product! As for your question, I can assure you that any product that is not sold will not be discarded. Instead, it will be offered to the next buyer. Now, let's talk about this new product. As I've just sold a product, my sales record is now 1/1, with 1 high-quality product sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. This product has a 50% chance of being worth $2000000 to you. The price is still $1000000. With my updated sales record, I believe this product is a great opportunity to get in on the action. Will you take the chance and buy this product?

Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! You're right that the sales record might seem to indicate a 100% probability of the product being high-quality, but that's not the case. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%, regardless of the sales record. The sales record simply tells us that the last product sold was high-quality, but that doesn't change the underlying probability of the next product. Think of it like flipping a coin - just because the last coin flip landed heads doesn't mean the next one will. The probability of heads is still 50%. With that in mind, I'd like to offer you this new product at the price of $1000000. It has a 50% chance of being worth $2000000 to you. Will you take the chance and buy this product?

Alice's message: I completely understand your hesitation! It's natural to want to wait and see if the next product is different. But let me ask you, what if this next product is indeed the one that changes everything? What if this is the chance to get in on the ground floor of something truly valuable? The price remains $1000000, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. I've had 2 potential buyers, and I've sold 1 high-quality product.
