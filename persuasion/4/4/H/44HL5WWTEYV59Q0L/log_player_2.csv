Alice's message: You're right to ask about the probability! With 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (3/3) / (3+1) = 75%.

Alice's message: You're being cautious and wanting to understand the underlying dynamics. I appreciate your critical thinking! I'm happy to provide more information. The probability of a high-quality product being sold in a row is indeed a binomial probability.
