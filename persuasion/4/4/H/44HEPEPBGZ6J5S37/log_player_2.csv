"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the quality of each product and is recommending it, there's a higher chance it's high quality.  Even though the chance of a low-quality product is higher, the potential payoff of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the value of the products and is withholding a recommendation. This strongly suggests that the product is likely low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, it's not worth the risk of buying it."
