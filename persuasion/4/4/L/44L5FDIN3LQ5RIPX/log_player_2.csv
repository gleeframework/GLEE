Alice's message: We're willing to make a concession on the price. We're now offering this product to you for $800000.

Alice's message: We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts so far, which is a 50% success rate. We're not sure what this product's quality is, but we're offering it to you for $800000, the same price as the last one. We're hoping that the law of averages will be in our favor this time.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I won't buy the product because the price you are offering ($800,000) is still too high for me considering there is a 66.67% chance that the product is of low quality. Furthermore, the law of averages does not apply in this situation as each product's quality is independent of the others.""}"
