A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though the current product is high-quality, there's no reason to believe the buyer would trust the seller.  The seller has a 50/50 chance of offering a good or bad product, and the buyer has no information to suggest otherwise. 

Since there's a high risk of getting a low-quality product, it's rational for the buyer to wait and see how other buyers fare before making a decision."

Therefore, it's still rational for the buyer to wait and see how other buyers fare before committing to a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no sales history yet, I'm not comfortable making a decision without more information. Perhaps I'll come back later if some sales data is available.
