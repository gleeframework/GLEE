,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality! The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 1/1. I'm glad I've broken my streak of selling only low-quality products.

,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your sales record. With only 3 high-quality products out of 4, it's still early to say you have a good track record. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase.",no

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products, which is a 66.67% ratio. I'm glad you're interested in the probability of the product being high-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50% and I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is also around 66.67%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, which is a 33% discount from its true value. I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is 66.67%. The sample size is still relatively small, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
