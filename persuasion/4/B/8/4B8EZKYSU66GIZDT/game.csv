,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because you think the product is low quality or because you think it's high quality but you're trying to test me? I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $1000000."
