"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd rather not buy without knowing the quality, the odds are against me.""}\n\nSince the probability of a low-quality product (66.67%) is twice that of a high-quality product (33.33%), and given that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, the risk outweighs the potential benefit. I'll wait for more information or a better offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Still not convinced, one missed opportunity doesn't change the odds.""}\n\nMissing out on a high-quality product in the previous round doesn't change the underlying probabilities for this round. The odds remain the same, and the risk of getting a low-quality product still outweighs the potential benefit of getting a high-quality one. I'll continue to be cautious."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""If Alice doesn't recommend it and I already know the odds are against me, I have even less reason to buy.""} 

Given Alice's recommendation against buying and my existing caution due to the probabilities, there's no compelling reason for me to take the risk on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice's recommendations seem inconsistent with the product's actual quality. I'll keep playing it safe.""}\n\nGiven the history, it seems Alice's recommendations don't necessarily correlate with the product's quality. Since the odds of getting a low-quality product remain higher, I'll continue to avoid the risk."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given Alice's track record, her recommendation doesn't sway me. The odds still favor a low-quality product.""}

Alice's past recommendations haven't aligned with the products' actual quality, so her current non-recommendation doesn't provide any valuable insight. With the probabilities still against me, I'll pass on this product as well."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've seen this pattern before; Alice's recommendations don't seem to correlate with quality.

Given the underlying probabilities remain the same (33.33% chance of high quality and 66.67% chance of low quality), I'll continue to avoid the risk."

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.
