high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical of the quality of the products you're offering."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. This is a strong indication that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for another buyer to buy this product and see if your recommendation changes."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence and the next one might be a gem."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold? Maybe I can make a more informed decision next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record. Could you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me more about your thought process behind recommending it to me?"

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or if there's a reason why all previous buyers didn't buy the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them bought it, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. However, I also know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that chance."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
