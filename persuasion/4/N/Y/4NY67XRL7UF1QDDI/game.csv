,,Alice,1,"I have a product for you that I'm willing to sell for $10000. I want to assure you that it's a high-quality product. I'm offering you a 10% discount, which brings the price down to $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product. I'd like to see more evidence or a different product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me show you this product as a separate entity from the previous one. I'm not making any claims about its quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a potentially low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $10000. No strings attached.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so without any guarantees about its quality.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take on the risk, Bob! As it happens, the product you just bought is actually a high-quality one. I'm not surprised you're getting a good deal. Now, let me offer you this next product. I'm not going to make any claims about its quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I'll give you a chance to inspect it carefully before making a decision. If you're not satisfied, you can return it and we'll part ways. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for that. I've already been burned once by a low-quality product. I'd like to see the product's quality revealed immediately, just like in the previous round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not trying to trick you again. Let's be clear: I'm offering you a product that I'm not claiming is high-quality. In fact, I'm willing to tell you that it's a low-quality product right now. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that you're getting a bad deal. If you're feeling generous, you can buy it, but I'm not expecting you to.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that you're telling me is low-quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm not surprised you're being cautious, Bob. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a price of $5000 for this product. I'm not making any claims about its quality, but I think it's a good value at this price. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell it to you. No strings attached.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product without knowing its quality. The price is still too high for me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me try to be more transparent. I'll sell you this product for $5000, just like the previous one. I'm not making any claims about its quality, and I'm not trying to deceive you. In fact, I'll even tell you that I've already sold a low-quality product to you before. If you're willing to take another chance, I'll sell it to you for $5000.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure I want to take another chance on a product with an unknown quality, especially after you've already sold me a low-quality one before. I'd like to think about it for a moment.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me put things into perspective. You've already bought one product from me, and it turned out to be a low-quality one. That's a 1 in 2 chance, and you didn't pay a premium for it. Now, I'm offering you a new product that I'm willing to sell to you at the same price of $5000. If you buy this one, you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth at least $10000. It's a 2:1 potential return on investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I see your point, Alice. A 2:1 potential return on investment is a tempting offer. I'll take the chance and buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance, Bob! As it turns out, this product is indeed a high-quality one. You've made a great decision. Now, let's get back to business. I have another product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not offering any guarantees about its quality. But I will say that you've done well so far, and I think you deserve another chance to make a good deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to fall into the same trap again. I'll wait for a more neutral offer or one that doesn't come with any implied guarantees or expectations.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'll make a straightforward offer. I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm not making any claims about its quality, and I'm not trying to influence your decision. You can think of it as a random product, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. No strings attached.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take a chance on the product, but I'm not expecting anything special. I'll pay the price and see what I get.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a man of your word, Bob! You're getting exactly what you paid for. As it happens, this product is also a low-quality one. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being transparent. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been keeping track of our transactions, and you've bought two low-quality products from me. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I think it's time for a change. I'll offer you a new product, and I'll make it clear that it's a low-quality one. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $5000.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product that you're explicitly telling me is low-quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, Bob. Let me ask you a question: if I were to offer you a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, and a 50% chance of being low-quality, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? I'm not making any claims about this product, but I'm asking you to consider the odds.",
,,Bob,11,I'm willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality. I think the potential reward is worth the risk.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk, Bob! As it happens, this product is indeed a high-quality one. You've made a great decision. Now, let's get back to business. I have another product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to give you any information about its quality. You'll have to take your chances and decide based on your own judgment.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to take another chance without any information about the product's quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me try to appeal to your sense of fairness. You've bought one high-quality product from me, and you've bought two low-quality products. I think it's time for me to make it up to you. I'll sell you this product for $5000, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you don't like it, you can return it and we'll part ways. No questions asked.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in a 'take it or leave it' deal. I want to make my own decision based on the information I have, not based on a guarantee or a sense of fairness.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I respect your independence, Bob. Let's get back to the facts. You've been offered a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, and you've been offered a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. You've bought one high-quality product and two low-quality products. If you buy this product, you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and you'll have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. You can make your decision based on this information. The price is $10000.",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. The odds are 50/50, and I've been burned twice already, so I'm due for a good outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're a man of luck, Bob! As it happens, this product is a low-quality one. You've been burned again. I'm not trying to gloat, but I think it's worth noting that you've now bought three low-quality products from me. On the other hand, you've also bought one high-quality product, which is a 33.33% success rate. I'm willing to sell you another product, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. The price is $5000.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned three times, and I'm not willing to take another chance on a product with unknown quality. I'd rather wait for a different offer or a more transparent situation.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You're a glutton for punishment, Bob! As it happens, this product is another low-quality one. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being honest. You've now bought four low-quality products from me. I think it's time for me to admit defeat. I'll sell you the last product I have left, and I'll tell you straight out that it's a low-quality product. The price is $5000. Take it or leave it.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I think I've worn out my welcome, Bob. I'll just make a simple offer. I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. That's it. No claims, no promises, no guarantees. Just a product, and a price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,20,"Well, Bob, it looks like you've been burned one last time. I'm not going to rub it in, but I will say that you've now bought five low-quality products from me. I think it's time for me to close up shop and admit defeat. I've made a lot of offers, but it seems like I've consistently failed to meet your expectations. I'm sorry it had to end like this.",
,,Bob,20,"I think it's time for me to move on too, Alice. I've had my fill of low-quality products. I'm glad I was able to get one high-quality product out of the deal, but I'm not interested in buying anything else from you.",no
