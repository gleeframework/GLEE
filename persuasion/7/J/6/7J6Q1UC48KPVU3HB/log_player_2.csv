**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very little information to go on. We know one product sold was high quality, but we don't know how many products were offered in total.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is valuable information.  It implies she has some way of assessing quality, even if it's imperfect. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product (worth $125) is significant, even with the high chance of a low-quality product.

**Strategy:** In this situation, it's worth taking a calculated risk. The recommendation from Alice, coupled with the potential reward, makes buying a reasonable choice."
