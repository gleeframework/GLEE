"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,500 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and the price is $10,000, it's always beneficial to buy the product. You have a positive expected value, even though there's a chance it might be low quality.  

**Expected Value Calculation:**

* **High Quality Probability:** 80%
* **High Quality Value:** $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500 profit
* **Low Quality Probability:** 20%
* **Low Quality Value:** -$10,000 loss

Expected Value = (0.8 * $2,500) + (0.2 * -$10,000) = $2,000 - $2,000 = $0

Even though the expected value is technically $0, you're still better off buying since you could potentially make a $2,500 profit."
