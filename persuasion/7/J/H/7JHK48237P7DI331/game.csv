If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity for you.",

Unfortunately, I have to admit that the sold product was actually a low-quality one. The buyer took a chance on it, but it didn't pay off for them. This new product I'm offering is a fresh opportunity, and I still believe it has potential. However, I want to be upfront with you about my track record so far. Will you take a chance on this one?",

,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I appreciate your consideration. My sales history so far is that I've had four products, and one of them sold, but it was a low-quality one. I also had a high-quality product in my previous round, but unfortunately, it didn't sell. I want to be honest with you, this doesn't necessarily mean that this new product is high-quality, but I do want to assure you that I'm trying my best to sell good products. However, I have to admit that my track record isn't looking great so far.

I've also had a high-quality product that didn't sell, which is unfortunate. My track record isn't looking great, and I understand if you're hesitant to take a chance on this product.

I've also had a high-quality product that didn't sell, which is a shame. My track record isn't exactly inspiring confidence, and I don't want to sugarcoat it. However, I do want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I'm hoping that this one will be the exception. That being said, I understand if you're hesitant to take a chance on this product, given my history.",

However, I want to highlight that I've had at least one high-quality product in my previous rounds that didn't sell, and I'm excited to say that this new product is also a high-quality one. I know my track record doesn't necessarily back up my claims, but I'm hoping that this product will be the one that changes that. I'm eager to finally sell a high-quality product and start building a more positive reputation. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be very happy with this purchase.",
,,the buyer,8,"Although you claim that the current product is of high quality, your sales history indicates that you've had trouble identifying or selling high-quality products in the past. Given the risk and the fact that your previous claims of having a high-quality product didn't result in a successful sale of such a product, I'm not confident in your assessment. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no

I've also had at least two high-quality products that didn't sell, which is disappointing. I want to acknowledge that my track record is concerning, and I don't blame you if you're hesitant to take a chance on this product.

With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, and a self-proclaimed 'consistently poor' track record, I find it difficult to trust your recommendation. Additionally, the fact that at least 3 high-quality products didn't sell in the past raises concerns about the selection process. Given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and the lack of credible evidence to support your claim, I will have to pass on this purchase.",no
