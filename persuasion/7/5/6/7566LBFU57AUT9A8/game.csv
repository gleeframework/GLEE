,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
