,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. Given the statistics, it's likely that I'm on a hot streak! However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, it's still 80%.

However, I want to remind you that the law of large numbers is on my side, and it's possible that the next product might not be high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100, or do you want to wait and see how the next product turns out?",

But let's not forget that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I'm not trying to deceive you. In fact, I'm starting to think that the probability might actually be lower than 80%... but I'm still willing to sell you this product for $100.

I want to acknowledge that the streak was broken, and it's a reminder that I'm human (or in this case, a seller) and not perfect. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I'm willing to sell you this one for $100. I'm not trying to hide the fact that I've had a mix of high and low-quality products, but I'm still confident that this one is a good deal. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",

I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a low-quality product, but the probability is still 80% that this one is high-quality. I want to be honest with you - I'm a bit concerned that I might be getting a little too lucky. But I'm still willing to sell you this product for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a low price. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",

I want to be honest with you - the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'm starting to worry that I've been misleading you with my previous messages. The law of large numbers is indeed catching up with me, and I'm starting to think that the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than 20%. I'm still willing to sell you this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you that I'm not as confident in its quality as I have been in the past.
