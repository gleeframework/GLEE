,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your honesty! I'd like to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. As you consider the next product, I'd like to remind you that 80% of my products are high-quality, which means 20% are not. I'm happy to offer you this next product for $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's a great opportunity to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%! What do you think?",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your desire for more information. As for the products that were discarded, I can tell you that they were both low-quality. One of them was sold in Round 2, and the other was sold in Round 4. Both buyers decided not to purchase the product, but as you can see, the overall track record is still strong - 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold. I'd like to reiterate that this new product is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. With the data we have, I think it's a great opportunity to take a chance on a high-quality product. What do you think?",

,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at full price. Given the low success rate, I'd like to pass on this one.
