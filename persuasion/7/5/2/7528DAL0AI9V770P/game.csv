,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling at a loss if you're not interested.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and even if it is high-quality, I can only sell it for $40000. I'd rather wait for more information.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to give you a more compelling reason to buy. If you purchase this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee that I'll sell you another high-quality product for $10000 in the next round, if you return this one to me after you've verified its quality. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one, and you can sell them both for $80000, making a profit of $60000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that I'll get a high-quality product in the next round. If I buy this one, I'll be out $10000 if the next one is low-quality, and I won't have any guarantee that I'll get a high-quality product in future rounds. I'd rather not take on that risk.",no

This will give you valuable information to make informed decisions in future rounds.",
