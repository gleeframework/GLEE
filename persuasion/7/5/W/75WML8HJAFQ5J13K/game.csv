low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, and it's a 50/50 chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that she doesn't know about."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product quality. Given that you are not recommended to buy, I will pass on the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, it's surprising that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before I make a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying, based on the fact that you don't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 4 buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely low. Given that I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity and avoid the potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, this is not surprising, but it still makes me cautious. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since none of the previous buyers were able to identify a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers who bought the product have received a high-quality one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have enough information to make a decision based on the statistics. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. This is because low-quality products are more likely to be passed on, so the fact that 5 buyers passed on the product suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance on a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. It suggests that the products being sold might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold given the current statistics, and I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product."
