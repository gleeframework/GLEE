,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you recommended it. Is it because you're trying to get rid of the low-quality products, or do you have some information that suggests this product is high-quality?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know if the first two buyers were offered high-quality or low-quality products, and if they were recommended to buy or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended were low-quality. I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous 3 buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far. If it's high-quality, I'd be happy to take the loss, but I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I get to pass on the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality, and since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 4 previous buyers who purchased the products and received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality, given that none of them were high-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, as 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the products despite the low probability of a high-quality product. I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality. Given the low quality of products sold so far, I'm taking a chance."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be low. I'm taking a risk, but I'm also getting a significant discount."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm not convinced that it's high quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
