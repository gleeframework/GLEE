,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I don't have any information to go on and I'm essentially a 50/50 shot at getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll take the product and see what I get."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'd like to know the quality of the previous products after my decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, and I suspect that all products are low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the odds of getting a high-quality product are not in my favor. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and I'd like to see the statistics again after I make my decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought it, it is likely that the product is low-quality. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm hoping that the low sales record of high-quality products is just a coincidence and that the next product is actually high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, which might suggest a bias in your recommendations. However, I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping that this one might be the exception."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low."
