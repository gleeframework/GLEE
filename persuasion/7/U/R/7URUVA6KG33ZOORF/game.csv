,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probabilities and the fact that no products have been sold yet."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's purchase and the overall sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%, which is suspiciously high. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that only one high-quality product has been sold out of one product sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record or because of some other reason?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product, and I'm not convinced that the product is worth $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I think Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her knowledge of my valuation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next one. I'm not convinced by the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to rely on Alice's recommendation without knowing the quality of the previous products, and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers bought the product, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you recommended it to me, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 80% probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll pass for now. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
