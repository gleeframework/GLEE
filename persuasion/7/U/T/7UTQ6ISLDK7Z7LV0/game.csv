,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision. I'd also like to know the total number of products sold so far.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/5, which is lower than the expected 2/6. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold, I'm guessing the probability is 1/5 or 20%. However, I'd like to know the probability you'd recommend a product to be bought based on the quality, and I'm guessing it's the opposite of the probability of the product being high quality. So, I'm guessing the probability you recommend a product is 80%. Am I correct?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5, I'm concerned that the remaining 4 low-quality products were sold as well, which would mean the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $10000 on a low-quality product."
