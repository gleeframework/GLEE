Would you like to take advantage of this increased probability and purchase this product for $10000?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is really 50%. With only 2 sales, the sample size is too small to make a reliable estimate, and I'm concerned that the true probability might still be around 33.33%.

If you're willing to take a chance, you could potentially get a high-quality product for $10000. On the other hand, if you pass on this opportunity, you'll be giving up the chance to get a high-quality product and will have to rely on the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality.

Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.

Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000?""
}"

Given the current statistics, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, especially since I know that 2 out of 4 products sold so far have been high-quality, which is higher than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the true probability of a high-quality product might be higher than I initially thought, and I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered.

Would you like to reconsider and buy this high-quality product?""
}"
