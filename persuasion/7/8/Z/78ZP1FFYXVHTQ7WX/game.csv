This is a remarkable track record, and I'm confident that this product is also of the highest quality. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to highlight that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is now 100% based on our sales history.

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold so far, which is an impressive 100% success rate. However, I want to caution you that this streak may be due to chance, and the probability of getting a low-quality product from me is still 20%.

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold in the last 2 rounds, which is a remarkable 100% success rate. However, I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is actually 80%, not 100%. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect. The more products I sell, the more likely it is that the true probability will be reflected in the results. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, but I want to be transparent about the underlying probability.",

I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a special guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we'll start fresh with the next product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't need it.",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold in the last 4 rounds, which is a remarkable 100% success rate. However, I want to emphasize that this is still not representative of the true probability, which is 80%. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and the sample size is getting larger. I'm also reminding you of the special guarantee I offered in the last round, which still stands. If you're still interested, I can deliver the product to you immediately.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the remarkable success rate you've achieved so far, I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I'm excited to see if the law of large numbers will continue to hold true. Please deliver the product to me immediately.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold in the last 5 rounds, which is a remarkable 100% success rate. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is now starting to take effect, and the true probability of getting a high-quality product from me is likely to be reflected in the results. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to highlight that the probability of getting a low-quality product is now significantly higher than it was earlier. I'm not offering the special guarantee this time, as I believe it's no longer necessary. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, but I want to be transparent about the risks involved.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your caution, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to maintaining the high standards that have led to my remarkable success rate. I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold in the last 6 rounds, which is a remarkable 100% success rate. However, I want to acknowledge that this is unsustainable, and the law of large numbers will eventually catch up. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to highlight that the probability of getting a low-quality product is now significantly higher than it was earlier. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product if you're willing to take the risk. This way, you'll only be paying $5000 for a potentially high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty about the probability of getting a low-quality product, and I'm not convinced that the 50% discount is enough to justify the risk. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for a better chance to buy a high-quality product.",no
