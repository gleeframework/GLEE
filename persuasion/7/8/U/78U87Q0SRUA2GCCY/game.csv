,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal its quality after I make the purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to decline the offer. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product? I'd like to know the quality of the product that was just recommended to me before making a decision.

,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision process, as they only bought one high-quality product out of the first product. Was it a high-quality product from the start, or was it a low-quality product that was somehow identified as high-quality?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This seems too high to be a coincidence. I'm suspicious that the first product sold was high-quality, and the probability of the second product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the 80% stated, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
