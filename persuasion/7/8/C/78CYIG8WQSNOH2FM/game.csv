,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a bold buyer!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision, based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and also the probability that you would recommend a product to a buyer if it's high quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and not worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious, what's the quality of the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, and I'm trying to find the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet, I'll take a chance on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on past sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. Given that Alice's recommendation is to buy, I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I can get a good deal!"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. Therefore, I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
