The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me provide you with a breakdown of the expected value of this purchase. Since the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the price is $1000000, the expected value of the high-quality product is $333333.33. On the other hand, since the probability of the product being low-quality is 66.67%, and the price is still $1000000, the expected value of the low-quality product is $666666.67. So, the overall expected value of this purchase is ($333333.33 + $666666.67) / 2 = $500000.

This product has a 40% chance of being high-quality, and the expected value of the high-quality product is $400000. The expected value of the low-quality product is $600000.
