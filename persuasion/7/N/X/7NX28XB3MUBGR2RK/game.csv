high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the previous products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's possible that the next product could be high-quality. However, since the previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one, hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
