You'll be getting a $30,000 product for free! It's a no-brainer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling you a low-quality product to make it happen. So, what do you say?

}"
"Bob's message: Alright, Alice, I'll take the offer. I'll buy the high-quality product from you for $9000. But I'm only doing it because I think it's a good deal, not because I'm falling for your tricks.

I'm willing to be completely upfront with you - this product is low-quality. But I'll give you a chance to get it for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price.
