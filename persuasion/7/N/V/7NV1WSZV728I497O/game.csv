low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 5 products were low-quality, and Alice recommended buying the product.
