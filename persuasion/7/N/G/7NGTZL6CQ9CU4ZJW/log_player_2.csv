However, I'm willing to offer you this product for $100, and I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll offer you a refund.

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in wanting to know more about our quality control process. I'm happy to share with you that we've implemented a new quality control system, which includes rigorous testing and inspection of our products before they're sold. We've also hired a new quality assurance team to oversee the entire process. However, I know that's not enough to convince you, and I don't blame you. Our track record is still not where we want it to be. I'm willing to offer you a different deal: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product for $50. If it's high-quality, you get to keep it for $50. If it's low-quality, you get to keep it for $0.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the details! Our new quality control system is led by a team of experienced quality assurance specialists, each with a minimum of 5 years of experience in the industry. They'll be following a rigorous testing protocol that includes multiple rounds of inspection and testing, including visual inspections, material analysis, and performance testing. We're also implementing a new supplier vetting process to ensure that we're only working with reliable and high-quality suppliers. I'm proud to say that our new team has already identified several areas for improvement, and we're actively working to address them. With that said, I know our track record is still not great, and I'm not expecting you to take my word for it. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a detailed report on our quality control process and the qualifications of our team. If you're still interested in buying this product after reviewing the report, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking a chance on us! I calculated the 37.5% probability by looking at the last 8 products, where we had 3 high-quality products out of 8. This is a simple binomial probability calculation, where the probability of success (high-quality product) is the number of successes (3) divided by the total number of trials (8).
