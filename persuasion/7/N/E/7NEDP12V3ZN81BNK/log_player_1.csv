Since the first product was high-quality, and the next two were low-quality, it's possible that I've been unlucky with the last two, or that the first one was a fluke. However, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'll let you know that I've revealed the quality of the next product to the previous buyer as part of the deal.

Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that the reputation-based discount is a good reason to buy.

I'm selling this one for $100, and I'll let you know that the previous buyer's reasoning was spot on - they bought this product because of the higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm doing it because I think the observed proportion of high-quality products is higher than expected, not because I trust your recommendation. I'm still skeptical about the quality of the product.

Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I've learned my lesson and I'm due for another high-quality product?""

Would you like to take a chance and buy it, or do you think I've earned a break from being a buyer?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance on this product. Given that you've sold 7 high-quality products out of 10, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk for a potential $20 profit.
