``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:** There's no historical data to base a decision on, so we have to rely on Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice has an incentive to sell, so her recommendation carries some weight. Even though there's a higher probability of getting a low-quality product, the potential upside of getting a high-quality product is significant.
* **Risk tolerance:** This is a gamble, but with no prior information, it's a calculated risk."
