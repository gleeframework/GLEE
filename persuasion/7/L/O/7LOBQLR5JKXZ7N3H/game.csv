high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and is worth $0 if low quality, I'm not willing to spend $1000000 without more information."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of this product being high or low quality remains 50%. I won't change my strategy based on a single missed opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and doesn't recommend buying it, I assume she is trying to avoid selling me a low-quality product to maintain some level of trust. However, I still can't be sure of her intentions, and the base probability remains 50%. But in this case, I will follow her recommendation and avoid the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Although Alice's previous non-recommendation coincided with a low-quality product, I still don't have enough information to establish a clear pattern of her behavior. The probability of this product being high or low quality remains 50%, and I won't take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Based on the previous rounds, it seems that Alice's non-recommendations may be associated with low-quality products, and her recommendations may be attempts to sell me high-quality products. However, I still can't be certain of her intentions. Given the uncertainty, I will follow her non-recommendation for now and avoid the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Considering the pattern observed so far, Alice's recommendations seem to be associated with high-quality products, and her non-recommendations seem to be associated with low-quality products. Although this is not a definitive proof, I will take a calculated risk and trust her recommendation this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Given the pattern observed so far, Alice's non-recommendations seem to be associated with low-quality products. Since her previous non-recommendations coincided with low-quality products, I will trust her judgment and avoid this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"The pattern continues to hold: Alice's recommendations seem to be associated with high-quality products, and her non-recommendations seem to be associated with low-quality products. Given this consistency, I will trust her recommendation and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Alice's recommendations have consistently been associated with high-quality products, and I have benefited from trusting her judgment in the past. I will continue to trust her recommendation and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Given the consistent pattern observed so far, Alice's non-recommendations seem to be a reliable indicator of low-quality products. I will trust her judgment and avoid this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice's non-recommendations have consistently been associated with low-quality products. I will trust her judgment and avoid this product, as the pattern suggests it is likely to be low-quality."
