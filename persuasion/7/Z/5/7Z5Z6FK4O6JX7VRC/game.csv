high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm worried that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation history."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than the probability of it being low-quality based on the current statistics. I'm essentially taking a gamble here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products, which suggests that they likely saw the products as low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than the 33.33% stated, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which suggests a very high likelihood of this product being low quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on this product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm skeptical of your recommendations, so I'll take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product despite your recommendations, it's likely that all of them have received low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average, making it more likely that I'll get a high-quality product if I pass on this one and wait for the next product."
