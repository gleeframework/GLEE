**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high quality:** Even though the overall probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, the fact that Alice has recommended the product to you and a high-quality product has already been sold suggests a higher likelihood of this product also being high quality. 
* **Potential for profit:** The potential payoff of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 for a low-quality product. 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the limited information available suggests a better-than-average chance of a positive outcome."

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the ""lemons problem"" where asymmetric information creates market failures.  Here's why it makes sense to buy:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product. Since she recommends buying, there's a higher chance it's high quality. Otherwise, she'd risk losing a sale and ruining her reputation.
* **Past Sales Data:**  The fact that two high-quality products were sold in the past suggests Alice might be more likely to offer high-quality products than the average 33.33%.  While this is not conclusive, it adds to the positive signal from Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, you only lose $100. But if it's high quality, you gain $25. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world situation, factors like Alice's reputation, the number of past sales, and the overall market for the product would all influence your decision."
