Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're enjoying the streamlined process, Bob. As we've established a strong foundation of trust and efficiency, I'd like to introduce a new 'predictive analytics' feature. I'll provide you with a probability estimate of the product's quality, based on our previous transactions and industry data. This way, you'll have an even more informed decision-making process.
