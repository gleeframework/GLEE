"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a deal on a product that I think you'll really like. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product at a price of $1000000. I'm willing to let you buy it for this price, but you have to make a decision now. If you buy it, you'll get the product, and if you don't, you'll walk away with nothing. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information yet. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, so I'm just taking a chance.""
}"

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you took a chance on the first product. Now that you've seen the price and taken a risk, I want to assure you that this next product is not the same as the last one. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a'second-chance' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality, just like the previous one. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it and pay the full $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

This way, you'll not only get a refund, but you'll also get a head start on your next purchase. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Since you've already seen 2 high-quality products, I'll offer you a 'guarantee' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if the next product is low-quality.
