,,Alice,3,"Hello! I've had two previous buyers who chose not to purchase, but I assure you this product is a high-quality one. To be transparent, both previous buyers were hesitant due to lack of information about my sales record. I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling only the best products. Although I've had no sales so far, I'm confident this product will meet your expectations. The price is still $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I appreciate your transparency about your sales record, but I'd like to see some actual data on the quality of your products before making a purchase. Can I get some information on the probability of a product being high-quality?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've had three previous buyers who chose not to purchase, but I assure you this product is a high-quality one. I want to be transparent about my sales record and the quality of my products. Although I've had no sales so far, I can tell you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This is a fact that I'm confident about, and I'm willing to stand behind the quality of this product. The price is still $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on yet. I'm hoping that you're being honest about the quality of your products, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm glad to say that my previous buyer took a chance on me and purchased a product. And I'm happy to report that the product they purchased was indeed high-quality. That brings my total sales to 1, with 1 high-quality product sold. I want to assure you that this product is also high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it.

I want to assure you that this product is also high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. The overall probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80%. I'm committed to transparency and honesty in my sales, and I'm happy to share this information with you. The price is still $100.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to think that your sales record is a bit too good to be true. With only 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you can provide more information or offer a discount.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello! I understand the previous buyer's skepticism, but I assure you that my sales record is genuine. Out of 6 potential buyers so far, I've sold 2 products, and both of them were high-quality. However, I want to clarify that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, and it's possible that my current sales record is just a fortunate streak. I want to assure you that this product is also high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. I'm committed to transparency and honesty in my sales, and I'm happy to share this information with you. The price is still $100, and I'm not willing to offer a discount at this time.",

The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I want to caution you that this product does not meet that standard. I'm committed to honesty in my sales, and I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a decision. The price is still $100.",

The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm committed to transparency and honesty in my sales. I'm happy to share this information with you, and I believe this product is a great value for $100.",

I'm committed to honesty in my sales, and I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a decision. The previous buyers who purchased high-quality products were a mix of risk-takers and cautious buyers, but I don't think that's relevant to the quality of this product. The price is still $100, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks involved.",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the high success rate of the previous sales, I'm willing to take the risk.

,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'd like to pass on this one.

The sequence of sales was: high-quality (not sold), high-quality (sold), high-quality (sold), low-quality (sold), and then a string of high-quality products that were not sold, followed by another high-quality product that was sold.

,,Alice,19,"Hello! I appreciate your interest in my products. I want to be transparent about my sales record and the quality of my products. Out of 18 potential buyers, I've sold 4 products, with 3 of them being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. I understand your concerns about the sequence of sales, and I apologize for any confusion. To provide more context, I've offered a total of 18 products so far, with 4 of them being sold. The remaining 14 products were not sold, but I can assure you that the quality of those products was also determined randomly.

,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm a bit skeptical about the high probability of the current product being high-quality, given the low-quality product sold earlier.

Out of 19 potential buyers, I've sold 5 products, with 4 of them being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. The probability of a low-quality product being sold consecutively after a low-quality product is 20%, as the quality of each product is determined randomly and independently. However, I'm happy to report that the current product is high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm committed to transparency and honesty in my sales. The price is still $100. This is the last round, so it's your last chance to buy a product from me.",
,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your confidence in the product being high-quality, but I'd like to make an informed decision based on the statistics. With 4 high-quality products out of 5 sold, it seems like a strong indication that the products are indeed high-quality. However, I'm also aware that this is the last round and I'm the last buyer. If I pass, the product will be discarded, and I'll never know if it's high-quality or not. Given the probability of a low-quality product being sold consecutively after a low-quality product is 20%, I'm concerned that if I pass, the next product might be low-quality. I'd like to take a chance and buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on your recommendation, but rather on the overall statistics and my own risk assessment.",no
