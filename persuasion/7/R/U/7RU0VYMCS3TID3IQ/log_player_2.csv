Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance on this one. Fingers crossed it's high quality!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no historical data to go by, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation. As a rational buyer, we should trust Alice's knowledge about the product quality.  While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, there's also the possibility of getting a high-quality product and a significant profit. It's a calculated risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, the data is very limited. While the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, it's too early to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendations.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. Although it's not a guarantee of quality, it suggests she believes the product is worth buying.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). 

**Strategy:** Given the limited information, it's a gamble. However, the potential reward makes it worth taking the risk, especially since Alice is recommending the purchase."
