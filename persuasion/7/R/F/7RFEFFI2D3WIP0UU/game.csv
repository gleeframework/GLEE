high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a fraction of its true worth. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else who will likely pay the full $30000. This is a chance to get a great deal, but I'm only offering it to you because I value our relationship and want to make you a special offer.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the product is randomly selected, and the probability of it being high-quality is only 80%. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase it at the same price of $10000. However, I'll also give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a great deal on this high-quality product and a potential discount on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it. Plus, the discount on the next product doesn't change the fact that I don't know what the next product is. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll let you inspect it before paying. You can verify its quality and authenticity, and if it's indeed high-quality, you can pay the $10000. If it's low-quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. This way, you'll have complete assurance that you're getting a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. If it's high-quality, I'd still have to pay $10000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. And if it's low-quality, I'd still lose $10000. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you a 'price adjustment' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a $5000 credit towards the next product. This way, if the next product is high-quality, you can pay the remaining $5000 and still get a great deal. If the next product is low-quality, you can use the credit to offset the loss. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'd still have to pay $5000 upfront, and even if the next product is high-quality, I'd only save $5000 on it. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is and make a decision based on its price and quality.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for the next product, at a price of $0. Yes, you heard that right - if you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you the next product for free. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you buy this product. If you don't take me up on this offer, I'll sell the next product at the usual price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to fall for this trap. I know the product is randomly selected, and I'm not going to pay $10000 for a high-quality product just to get a free product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I'm not trying to trick you. I want to make a straightforward offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at a price that reflects its true value. However, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product will be low-quality. If you buy this product, I'll reveal that the next product is low-quality, and you can save $10000 by not buying it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $30000 for $10000. Even if you guarantee that the next product is low-quality, I'd still be losing $10000 on this deal. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, but with a twist. If you buy it, I'll give you the option to sell it to me for $20000 at the end of the 20 rounds, regardless of the quality of the remaining products. This way, you'll have the opportunity to make a profit on the product, and I'll give you a chance to get a good deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $30000 for $10000, even with the option to sell it back to you later. I'd still be losing $20000 on the deal. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, but with a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products. If any of them are high-quality, you can return this product and get a full refund. If none of them are high-quality, you can keep this product and I'll give you a $10000 credit towards the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $30000 for $10000, even with the guarantee that I'll get a refund if the next 5 products are low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is and make a decision based on its quality and price.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to make a bold offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, but with a twist. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products, and you can return this product and get a full refund if any of them are high-quality. But, if all 5 are low-quality, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the remaining 11 products before buying any of them. You'll get to see the quality of every product before making a purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $30000 for $10000, even with the guarantee that I'll get a refund if the next 5 products are high-quality. And the offer to inspect the remaining 11 products doesn't change the fact that I'm overpaying for the current product. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm willing to make a one-time concession. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and it's a significant discount from the true value of $30000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for the 'lowest price ever' trap. I know the product is randomly selected, and I'm not going to pay $8000 for a product that's worth $30000 to me. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm willing to make a transparent offer. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with selling this high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll reveal the actual costs I incur to sell it to you, including the costs of production, marketing, and other expenses. If the costs are lower than $8000, I'll refund the difference to you. If the costs are higher than $8000, you'll still get the product for $8000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $30000 for $8000, even if you provide a detailed breakdown of the costs. I'd still be losing $22000 on the deal. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm willing to make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, and I'll also give you a chance to sell it back to me for $25000 at the end of the 20 rounds. This way, you'll have the opportunity to make a profit on the product, and I'll give you a chance to get a good deal.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to try to sell you anything today. I think we've both been through enough offers, and it's clear that the product's value isn't matching the price. I'll just let you know that the product is low-quality, and you can move on to the next round without any pressure to buy. Let's just move forward and see what the next product has in store.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm glad we're moving on to the next round. I don't want to buy a low-quality product for $10000, even if it's free. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to make any more offers or try to convince you to buy. I think we've established a pattern, and you're not interested in buying at the current price.
