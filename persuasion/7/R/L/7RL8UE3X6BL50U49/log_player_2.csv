I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to assure you that the probability of it being high-quality is actually higher than that.

Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical buyer, and I respect that! You're right, 2 sales isn't a large enough sample size to make any definitive conclusions. However, I'd like to point out that you're not buying from just any seller. I've been selling for a while now, and I've had a total of 3 sales. Out of those 3, 1 has been high-quality. That's a 33.33% success rate, but it's still a start! I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, and I'm confident that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the sample average. I'll even throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a free upgrade to a product that's worth an additional $50.

To answer your question, I've offered a total of 5 products so far, and 3 of them have been sold (including the 1 high-quality one from Round 4).

To answer your question, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80% in the population. However, with 1 high-quality product out of 5, the sample proportion is 20%. This is indeed lower than the population proportion, but it's still within the margin of error. I'd like to offer you a more concrete way to think about it: if I were to sell 10 more products, the expected number of high-quality products would be 8, assuming the population proportion is 80%.
