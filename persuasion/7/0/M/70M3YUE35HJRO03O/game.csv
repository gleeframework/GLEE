,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy the product and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is likely low. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I think the probability of a high-quality product is low given the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
