If you buy this product, I'll be left with a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product to the next buyer. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling a low-quality product to the next buyer. What do you say? Will you buy it for $10000?

Since the previous product was high-quality, the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is now 2:1.

If I were selling high-quality products at a rate higher than the initial 50% chance, I would expect to see a mix of high-quality and low-quality products.
