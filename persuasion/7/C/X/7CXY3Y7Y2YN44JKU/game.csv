,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that you're recommending it. Is there a reason you think this product is high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a low-quality product. I'm hoping that the product is actually high-quality, and I'll get a good deal."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which suggest a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended me to buy it, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is 0.25, which is lower than the prior probability of 0.5. I'd like to wait for another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I'd like. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards the fact that she has already sold 1 high-quality product out of 4, which suggests a higher proportion of high-quality products than the true 50% probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a final decision. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds are 50/50, and I could potentially get a $2000 profit if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not sure if I should buy this product. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the products offered to all the previous buyers?

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold was high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
