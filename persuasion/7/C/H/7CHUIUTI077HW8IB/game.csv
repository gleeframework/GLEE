high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm hesitant to buy given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows the quality distribution and may be trying to manipulate the sale by not recommending low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not going to get a good feeling about this."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's likely that the product I'll get will be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
