high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to give me the benefit of the doubt. But I think it's time I gave you a bit of a challenge. This next product is also high-quality, but I'm going to offer it to you at the same price as the others. I want to see if you'll take it without the guarantee, based solely on the value you've seen in the previous products. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Will you take it for $100?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll buy it, since all the previous products have been high-quality and I've made a profit on each one, but I have to say, the lack of a guarantee this time makes me a bit more cautious, and I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop and see a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance. But I think it's time I gave you a bit of a reality check.

This next product is indeed high-quality, but it's not as rare or valuable as the previous ones. It's still a great product, but I'm offering it to you at a slightly higher price than usual. I'll give you a 10% discount, and I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special deal on the next one. Will you take it for $90?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll buy it, since it's still a high-quality product and the discount is a nice touch, plus the promise of a special deal on the next one is intriguing, but I have to say, I'm starting to wonder if you're ever going to offer a low-quality product or if this is just some kind of clever sales tactic.",yes

I'm doing this to prove a point: even a low-quality product has some value, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that reflects that. So, will you take a chance on this product, or do you want to wait and see what the next one is?",

I'm willing to take a loss on this one, just to prove that I'm not just trying to rip you off. Will you take a chance on this product?",
