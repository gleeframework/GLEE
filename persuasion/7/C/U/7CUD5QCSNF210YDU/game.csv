,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that you may have some doubts. I'd like to propose a simple experiment: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a free high-quality product in the next round. This way, you'll have a chance to experience the quality of my products firsthand. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're not convinced by my proposal, I'll make a simple statement: I'm willing to sell this product to you for $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate the price further. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a 'no-risk' option: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. However, if it's low-quality, you'll still get to keep the product, and we can move on to the next round.",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'get out of one free' pass: you can choose not to buy the next product, and I'll still give you the VIP status and the heads-up on the quality of the next product.
