high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products offered to them were likely low-quality. This pattern implies that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than the base probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by you, which would give me a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
