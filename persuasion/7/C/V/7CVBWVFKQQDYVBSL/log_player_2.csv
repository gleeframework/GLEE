"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got another great one! This product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. But I want to let you know that I've already sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, so this one might not be as valuable to you. Still, it's worth $125, and I think it's a good opportunity to get another great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it! I'm on a roll!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 3
Alice's message: You're on a roll indeed! I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I want to mention that I've already sold you two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. This might be a low-quality product, and I'm giving you a chance to take advantage of this anomaly. It's still worth $125, but I'm offering it to you at a discount, so it's a great opportunity to get a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it! I'm not going to let a little thing like probability stop me from getting a great deal!""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling optimistic! However, I want to be transparent with you - you've now bought three high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just really lucky, but it's also possible that you're just really unlucky. Either way, this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. But I want to warn you that the probability of it being low-quality is actually quite high, given the previous results. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm actually starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 80% after seeing the streak of high-quality products. I'm offering you this one for $100, but I want to give you an option to verify its quality before buying. If you're willing to pay $120, I'll let you inspect the product before purchasing, and if it's indeed high-quality, you can keep it. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $120.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not paying $120 to inspect a product. If it's high-quality, I'll buy it from you for $100. If it's low-quality, I'll just pass and you'll be out the product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your stance, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a different deal on this low-quality product. I'll give it to you for $50, and I'll also throw in a $50 store credit that you can use on any future purchase. This way, you'll be getting a great deal on a product that's worth $0 to you, and you'll also have a chance to get a high-quality product in the future at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not paying $50 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand that the previous offer wasn't to your liking. Let me offer you a simpler deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $100, but I'll also include a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product. This way, you'll only be paying $100 for a product that's worth $125, and you'll also get a chance to get a second high-quality product for free.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's a interesting offer. I'll take the risk and buy the product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product! Now, I'll remind you that the guarantee I offered still stands. With two high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually quite low. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. If you don't buy this one, I'll give you a full refund for the previous product, and you'll be able to walk away with a profit of $25. It's up to you to decide whether the potential profit is worth the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to take the refund on the previous product and walk away with a profit. I'm not going to take the risk on this one.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your decision to take the refund, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make one more offer to you. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and then passed on the next two, I think it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $80, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $100. I'm willing to take a loss on this one if it means I can get rid of it and make room for a low-quality product that I can sell to someone else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's a tempting offer. I'll take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product at the discounted price! Now, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think about it. Remember that you've already bought two high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'm willing to let you have this product for $80, but only if you're willing to make a decision right now. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great deal.

I'll even throw in a $100 store credit that you can use on any future purchase, so you'll be getting a great deal even if you don't buy this product. But if you're feeling generous, I'll let you have it for $50, and you can use the store credit to get a high-quality product at a discount.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not paying $50 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll take the store credit and pass on the product.""}"

With two high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually quite low.
