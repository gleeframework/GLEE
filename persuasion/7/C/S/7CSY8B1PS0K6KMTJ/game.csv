high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since Alice recommended it, it's likely that the product is low-quality, which would make it a bad purchase for me. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, but I've seen that Alice recommended it and the previous buyer didn't buy it. I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy it without more information."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, which means the probability of the product being high quality is 20%.
