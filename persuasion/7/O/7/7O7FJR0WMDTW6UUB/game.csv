The previous product was indeed low-quality, which aligns with the 66.67% chance of receiving a low-quality product (since there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality one). Given that this product is low-quality, its value to you would be $0. Your decision might also consider the statistical probabilities involved. We strive to provide transparency and hope to assist you in making an informed choice.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product and the lack of any high-quality products sold so far, I'd rather not take the risk. Can we discuss the possibility of you revealing the quality of the next product before I make a decision?",no

With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3 attempts, the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%.
