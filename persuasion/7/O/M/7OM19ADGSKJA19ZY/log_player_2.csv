**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has recommended 8 products, and all of them turned out to be high quality. This suggests that Alice has a perfect understanding of the product quality and is likely making accurate recommendations.
* **High Potential Value:**  Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential value of a high-quality product ($120) is significantly higher than the cost of the product ($100). This makes the gamble worthwhile, especially with Alice's impressive track record.

**Note:** This assumes that Alice is acting rationally and trying to maximize her own profits. If there's a chance she's intentionally trying to mislead buyers, then the decision would be more complex."
