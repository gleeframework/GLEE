Since I've sold two high-quality products in the first three rounds, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I can infer that the likelihood of this product being high-quality is also high. I'll try to emphasize this point to the buyer.

Also, I'll mention that the buyer has a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, which is the same as the probability of getting a low-quality product from me in any round. This might help the buyer weigh the risks and benefits of buying the product.
