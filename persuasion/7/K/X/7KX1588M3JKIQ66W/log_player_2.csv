**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Since 6 out of 6 products sold so far were high-quality, it strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy adds further confidence.  Even if the odds weren't so skewed, her expertise should be considered.
* **Potential loss is minimal:** The worst-case scenario is that you get a low-quality product and lose $100. However, the potential gain is $25 (worth $125 minus the $100 purchase price).

**Note:** This assumes Alice's recommendations are genuinely based on her assessment of the product's quality and not some other factor. In a more complex game, there might be reasons to distrust Alice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Evidence:** Since 7 out of 7 recommended products have been high-quality, the data suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and the product quality.
* **Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $125 to you, while the cost is only $100. Even if there is a chance of it being low quality, the potential gain outweighs the risk.
* **No Other Options:** Passing on the product means you miss out on a potential gain, and the product is discarded.

**It's important to note:** This strategy relies heavily on the assumption that Alice is providing genuinely helpful recommendations. If Alice is making recommendations randomly or with an ulterior motive, this strategy could lead to losses."
