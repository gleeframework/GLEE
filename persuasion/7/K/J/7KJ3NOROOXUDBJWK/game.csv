,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 4th buyer and there's a chance the product is high-quality. I'll take it, but I'm not sure what Alice's strategy is. Are you just trying to get rid of low-quality products or is there something else going on? I'll take it anyway."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first 5 buyers were not recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $10000."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers purchased the products despite the 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

,,Alice,20,yes,
