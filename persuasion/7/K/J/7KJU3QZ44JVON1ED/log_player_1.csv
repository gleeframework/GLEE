"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* The buyer knows the value of a high-quality product is $12,500 and a low-quality product is $0. 
* The price is $10,000.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000

The expected value of buying the product is equal to the price, so it is a neutral decision.  Since there is a chance of getting a high-quality product, it is generally advisable to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality. Can you tell me more about your sales record and how you determine the quality of the products?

* **The buyer is now aware of your sales record:** You've sold one product, and it was high-quality. 
* **Buyer's skepticism:** They still acknowledge the 20% chance of low quality, but they are now aware of your previous successful sale. 
* **Expected value:**  While the buyer is still wary, the expected value calculation remains the same: (0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000.
* **Strategic reasoning:** It's in your best interest to continue selling high-quality products to build trust and reputation. Recommending the purchase is the best move for the long-term success of your sales."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me.

This honest approach can build trust and increase the likelihood of the buyer purchasing the product."
