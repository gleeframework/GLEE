With 11 products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the probability of a product being low-quality is also increasing. In fact, if I continue to sell low-quality products, the probability of the next product being high-quality will eventually increase. I'm not trying to deceive you - I'm just explaining the math.

With this new information, I'm offering you a high-quality product that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a 16.67% discount. What do you think?""}"
