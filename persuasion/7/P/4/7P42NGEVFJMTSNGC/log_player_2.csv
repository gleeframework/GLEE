With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the product being high quality is 0.5, which is the same as the prior probability. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given Alice's recommendation to not buy. This is a Bayes' update problem. Assuming Alice's recommendation is independent of the product's quality, the probability of the product being high quality given the recommendation to not buy is still 0.5.
