high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, but this is likely due to chance. I'd like to wait and see how the next product is recommended."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
