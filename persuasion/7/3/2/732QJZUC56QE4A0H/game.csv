,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm doing you a huge favor by selling it to you at this price, considering the market value is likely to be much lower. If you're interested, I'll give you a great deal on this one-time opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price, thank you for the offer.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but let me sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a free accessory worth $500, and I'll give you an exclusive 10% discount on any future purchases from me. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I want to build a relationship with you. The product itself is still only $10000, but I think you'll find it's a great value considering the extras.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the extras. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already taken a loss on this product, and I'm only offering it to you at $10000 because I value our potential future business together. If you're not interested, I'll have to take a bigger loss if I sell it to someone else. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll sell it to you for $5000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",
,,Bob,3,"I still don't think it's a good value for me, even at $5000. I'm not willing to pay for something that's worth $0 to me.",no

I'll sell it to you for $2500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'll even throw in a personal guarantee that I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product. This is my last offer, and I'm counting on you to help me move this product out of my inventory.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a significantly reduced price. I'm not looking to take on any potential losses, and I'd rather not have to deal with a refund process.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. I'm starting to think that I should just eat the loss on this one. However, I want to ask you a question: if I were to offer you a chance to buy a high-quality product, would you be interested in considering it? I'm not saying it's this product, but a product that I'm confident you would value. Would you be willing to take a chance on a high-quality product, even if it means paying the full price of $10000?",
,,Bob,5,"I'd be interested in considering a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to take a chance on the current product, which has been proven to be low-quality. I'd need to see a high-quality product before making a decision.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I want to build trust with you.",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're interested in the high-quality product! As you review the report and inspect the product in person, I want to make sure you understand that the two products are distinct.

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, but you have to agree to provide me with feedback on why you wouldn't buy it, even at no cost. This will help me improve my product offerings in the future. It's a win-win: you get to help me improve, and I get to get rid of this product.",
