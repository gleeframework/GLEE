"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality, and Alice is recommending you to buy it, it makes sense to take a chance. The potential payoff of a high-quality product is significantly higher than the risk of getting a low-quality product."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now a signal.  Since she previously recommended a high-quality product, her lack of recommendation in this round suggests the current product might be low quality.
