,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and you're trying to avoid being the first buyer of a high-quality product?"

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Given that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, I'm concerned that the low-quality products might be more common than expected. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better experience."
