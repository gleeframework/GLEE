If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the inspection fee (which is $0 in this case). This way, you can try the product risk-free. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I've got a great one for you this time! I've personally inspected this product and can confidently say it's a high-quality item.

I'm willing to provide a 10-year warranty on this product, so you can have peace of mind knowing you're making a safe investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The 10-year warranty doesn't change my assessment of the risk.",no

This way, you have a 33.33% chance of getting a great deal, and a 66.67% chance of getting a full refund. What do you say?",

But, if it's high-quality, you'll get the product for the discounted price of $10000. What do you say?",

This way, you can try the product risk-free, and if you don't like it, you can sell it back to me at a guaranteed price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the buyback option, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The $5000 buyback option doesn't change the fact that I'd be overpaying for a product that might not be worth anything to me.",no

This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a price that's already discounted from its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not falling for it. I already know that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, and paying $10000 for it is still a bad risk for me.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've got a product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm also including a 5-year maintenance package, which will ensure that the product remains in top condition. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the maintenance package, but I'm still not willing to pay $9000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The maintenance package doesn't change the fact that I'd be overpaying for a product that might not be worth anything to me.",no

,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $7000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The 20% discount on my next purchase is nice, but it's not enough to change my decision to pay a premium price for a product that might not be worth anything to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell this product to you for $5000, which is the lowest price I've ever offered. This is a one-time deal, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a $100 gift card to use on a future purchase. What do you say?",

This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product and a potential long-term investment opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking on a share of future profits. I'm not a business partner, I'm a buyer. I'd rather just buy the product outright and be done with it. And considering the product is likely to be low-quality, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it.",no

I'll sell you this product for $500, and I'll throw in a personalized thank-you note. That's it. No strings attached. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but $500 is still a lot to pay for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'm not willing to take on that risk, even for a personalized thank-you note.",no

Just take the product and enjoy the massage. It's the least I can do.",
,,Bob,19,"I appreciate the gift, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for it again. I know the product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm not going to pay $10000 for it, even if it's free. I'll just take the massage gift certificate and consider this our final interaction.",no

But, I'll throw in a special deal - if you buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not completely satisfied. No questions asked. It's my way of saying thank you for being a good sport throughout our negotiations. What do you say?",
