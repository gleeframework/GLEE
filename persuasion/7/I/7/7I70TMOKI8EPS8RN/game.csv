high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended it, I'm worried that it might be low-quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is not high enough for me to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the fact that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product?

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to rely on Alice's recommendation, I want to make my own decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll pass and see what the next buyer does."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, and Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

Could you please share more information about the product or the sales data that led to this decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry. If the product is high quality, I'll get a good deal. If it's low quality, I won't lose anything, and I'll have helped Alice get rid of a low-quality product."
