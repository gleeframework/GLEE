,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%, which would make the expected value of buying a product lower than $1000000. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
