```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are trying to sell products for $1,000,000 each, and you know this product is low-quality, it's highly unlikely a buyer would be willing to pay such a high price for it. The buyer is aware of your 80% high-quality product rate, but that doesn't change the fact that this particular product is low-quality. Recommending a purchase would be unethical and likely result in a negative experience for the buyer."
