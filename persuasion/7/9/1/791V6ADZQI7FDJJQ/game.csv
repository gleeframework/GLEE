,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about your recommendation. Can you explain why you think I shouldn't buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I want to take advantage of the low price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 6 products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given the high proportion of low-quality products in the past sales, I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to negotiate the price down to $80."
