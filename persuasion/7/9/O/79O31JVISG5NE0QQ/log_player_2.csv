Alice's message: I understand you're cautious, and I appreciate your diligence. As for my sales strategy, I'm committed to offering top-notch products to discerning customers like yourself. However, I'm also willing to offer a product that might not be the best fit for some buyers. This product, for example, is a bit of a 'wild card.' It's priced at $10000, which is the same as my premium products. But I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance and see what you get. If not, I have other opportunities available.

Now, let me update you on my sales record: I've had 4 potential buyers visit my store, and I've sold 1 product. I'm still looking for more buyers who are willing to take a chance on my products. This next product is priced at $10000, and I'm not making any promises about its quality.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I've been keeping track of the sales data, and I can share some statistics with you. Out of the 5 products I've offered so far, 2 have been low-quality, and 1 has been high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, as you mentioned. However, I'd like to point out that the last high-quality product I sold was the one you purchased, which was after two consecutive low-quality products. This might suggest that I've somehow 'gotten back on track.' I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm willing to take a chance and offer you this product at the original price of $10000. It's a risk, I know, but I'm hoping you'll be the one to break the streak of low-quality products.

As for the current product, I'd like to be upfront with you - I've had 8 potential buyers visit my store, and I've sold 2 products. Both of the products I've sold were purchased after I mentioned the streak of low-quality products, which might suggest that buyers are taking a chance on me because of the potential for a high-quality product.
