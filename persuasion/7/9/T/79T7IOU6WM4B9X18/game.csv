,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which might imply that it's low-quality. However, I'd rather take the risk and buy it to try to get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 50%. I'm inclined to believe that the product I'm being offered is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying it."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers who bought based on your recommendations have all gotten low-quality products, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $100."
