Given that I've sold 2 low-quality products out of 3, the probability that both of them got low-quality products is... (drumroll please)... 66.67%! And the probability that at least one of them got a high-quality product is... (drumroll again)... 33.33%! So, there's a good chance that this one could be the one that breaks the streak!
