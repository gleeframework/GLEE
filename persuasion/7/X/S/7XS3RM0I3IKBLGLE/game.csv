,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, but if you don't, I'll just have to sell it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price. What do you say?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the previous product! This next one is a different story, though.

I want to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this excellent product.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand the need for fair pricing. Considering the product's quality and our previous transactions, I'm comfortable with the full price. I'll purchase this product as well.",yes

I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this product and give it a new home, despite its lower quality.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000, but I want to offer you a 'guarantee': if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund.

I'll sell it to you for $1200000, which is a 20% premium over the usual price. I think this product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth the extra cost. However, I'm also willing to throw in a free inspection and maintenance package, which is usually a $20000 value. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a top-of-the-line product with extra perks.",
