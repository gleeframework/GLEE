,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you again that this product is of the highest quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Let's look at the bigger picture. You've passed on 5 high-quality products so far, and only bought 1 low-quality one. The odds are still in your favor.

The trend is clear: most of our products are high-quality. This next one is likely to follow suit. Take advantage of the consistency.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not convinced by the trend. I've been burned before, and I'm not going to get caught up in a narrative about consistency. I'll pass on this one.",no
