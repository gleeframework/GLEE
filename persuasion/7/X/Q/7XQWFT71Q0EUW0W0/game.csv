,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it based on the product's quality or something else?"

,,Alice,4,yes,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what led you to recommend against it. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since the previous 2 buyers passed on the product and I have no information about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the seller's previous sales record. The fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product makes me think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products sold were likely low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount since you're not recommending it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm hoping for a discount to make it worthwhile."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope for a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, and Alice recommends buying the product. Given the low-quality products were sold in the past, it's likely the current product is also low-quality. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, and I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality. Can you tell me more about the previous products that were sold?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I only get $0 value out of it."
