,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the quality is, but I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I've seen that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm also curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth the $10000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision, considering the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were not recommended to buy, I suspect that all the products sold so far were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the probability of 3 consecutive low-quality products is 0.6667^3 = 0.423. This is a very low probability. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product, hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 0.33, and that Alice's recommendation is not entirely based on the product quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record, and your recommendation. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that out of 3 previous buyers, none of them got a high-quality product, which is unusual given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or if she's trying to manipulate me. I'd like to wait for another product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product. Is it because of the statistics, and if so, what do you think is the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data?"

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
