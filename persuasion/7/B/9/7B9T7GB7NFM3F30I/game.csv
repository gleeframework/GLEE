low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm going to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're not recommending it suggests it might be low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, and I have no information about the quality of the current product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, which might be biased towards low-quality products."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I don't have any information about the product's quality yet, and I don't want to make a decision without any evidence. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If I buy this product, I'll be contributing to the seller's revenue without getting a high-quality product, which would be a bad deal for me. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice is recommending low-quality products. If she had high-quality products, I would expect to see at least one sale by now. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
