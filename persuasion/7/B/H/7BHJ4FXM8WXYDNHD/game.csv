,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, but I'm a seller, and my goal is to make a sale. I'm willing to provide you with information to help you make an informed decision. Since you don't know the quality of the product, I'll give you a chance to ask me a yes/no question about the product. What would you like to know?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to ask if the product has a higher chance of being high-quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've asked a great question, but I'll give you a more nuanced answer. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, which is not very high. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. If I were to tell you that the product is low-quality, you would likely not buy it, and I wouldn't get any money. On the other hand, if I were to tell you that it's high-quality, you might buy it, and I'd make a sale. Since I'm a seller, I have an incentive to be honest with you, but I'm also not going to give away free information if I don't have to. With that said, I'll give you another chance to ask a yes/no question about the product. What would you like to know?",
,,Bob,2,I'd like to ask if the product is high-quality.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're asking a direct question again! I'll give you a straightforward answer this time. Yes, the product in front of you is indeed high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the price is still $10000. You've had a chance to ask questions in the previous rounds, and now you have a high-quality product in front of you. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need you to decide quickly. Will you buy this high-quality product for $10000?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer! You're waiting for a better deal, and I respect that. Since you're not interested in this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a hint about the price. I'm willing to lower the price of this low-quality product to $5000. It's a one-time offer, and I won't lower it any further. Keep in mind that you still have no idea whether the next product will be high-quality or low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're sticking to your guns! I respect that. Since you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, I'll try to make a more compelling offer on the high-quality product. I'll give you a deal: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't lower the price any further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm still not willing to pay $8000 for a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and see what Alice has to offer.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a tough negotiator! I'll try to make another offer. Since you're not interested in buying the high-quality product at $8000, I'll give you an even better deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $7000. However, I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a one-time offer, and I won't lower the price any further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the deal! I'll buy the high-quality product for $7000 and look forward to the 10% discount on the next product.,yes

I'll give you a special deal: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $4500, which is a 10% discount from the original price of $5000.
