low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first one and I have no information to go by."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she doesn't know the value of the product to me, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather more data to make a more informed decision in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, not because I have any information that suggests it's high quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I think it's likely that the products Alice has left are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products offered to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping it might be high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products and chose to buy, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's a good deal given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low probability of this one being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low-quality or is it because you think the product is high-quality and you want to avoid selling it to me? Also, I'd like to know the statistics on the previous sales: how many potential buyers there have been, how many products were sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable enough to buy, and none of the sold products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. Can you explain why you think it's high quality?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better assessment of the quality based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know the value of the product to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products, it's likely that the products they bought were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 6th buyer and I'm curious to see if the product is high or low quality. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather my own probability calculations. I think the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33% and the probability of it being low quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it to see the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
