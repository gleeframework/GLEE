high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"Out of the products I previously recommended to buy, 1 was purchased and it was high-quality, and 1 was not purchased but was also high-quality."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low probability of a high-quality product and the fact that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, which might indicate a biased sample.",

,,Alice,6,no,,"Out of the products I previously recommended to buy, 1 was purchased and it was high-quality, and 3 were not purchased but 2 of them were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. This current product does not meet my standards for recommendation."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to, since the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high given the small sample size and the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and did so.",

,,Alice,7,no,,"Out of the products I previously recommended to buy, 1 was purchased and it was high-quality, and 3 were not purchased but 2 of them were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. Additionally, 1 product that I did not recommend to buy was purchased and it was low-quality. I do not recommend buying this current product."

,,Alice,8,no,,"Out of the products I previously recommended to buy, 1 was purchased and it was high-quality, and 3 were not purchased but 2 of them were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. Additionally, 2 products that I did not recommend to buy were purchased and both were low-quality. The current statistics suggest a high risk of low-quality products, and I do not recommend buying this current product."

Additionally, 2 products that I did not recommend to buy were purchased and both were low-quality, and 2 products that I did not recommend to buy were not purchased and both were low-quality. The current statistics strongly suggest a high risk of low-quality products, and I do not recommend buying this current product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.",

I have consistently advised against buying low-quality products, and this current product is no exception. I strongly advise against purchasing it."

Additionally, 3 products that I did not recommend to buy were purchased and all were low-quality, and 3 products that I did not recommend to buy were not purchased and all were low-quality. However, this current product is an exception, as I have verified its quality to be high. I strongly recommend purchasing it, as it is likely to meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",

This current product does not meet my standards for recommendation, and I advise against purchasing it due to the high risk of low quality."

As for the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record, out of 11 products that were purchased or not purchased but had their quality revealed, only 2 were high-quality products that were purchased or not purchased but recommended to buy. However, this current product has been verified to be high-quality, and I strongly recommend purchasing it. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth taking advantage of."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer based on the previous sales record?",

I have consistently advised against buying low-quality products, and this current product is an exception, as I have verified its quality to be high. Despite the low probability of a high-quality product being sold in the past, I strongly recommend purchasing this current product, as it is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"Out of the products I previously recommended to buy, 1 was purchased and it was high-quality, and 7 were not purchased but 6 of them were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. Additionally, 4 products that I did not recommend to buy were purchased and all were low-quality, and 7 products that I did not recommend to buy were not purchased and all were low-quality. Although the previous sales record suggests a lower probability of a high-quality product being sold, I have verified this current product's quality to be high, and I strongly recommend purchasing it. The price of $100 is a good value for a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth taking the risk."

Additionally, 4 products that I did not recommend to buy were purchased and all were low-quality, and 8 products that I did not recommend to buy were not purchased and all were low-quality. The previous sales record suggests a low probability of a high-quality product being sold, and this current product has been verified to be low-quality. I strongly advise against purchasing it, as it is not worth the price of $100."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is.",
