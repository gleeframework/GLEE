**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:**  The initial 50/50 odds of a high-quality product are strengthened by the fact that two high-quality products have already been sold, suggesting Alice is likely recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of the product being high quality. While not a guarantee, it's a strong signal. 
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on a potential $12,000 gain. Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward is significant.

**Overall:**  Given the available information and the potential upside, buying the product seems like the better strategy."
