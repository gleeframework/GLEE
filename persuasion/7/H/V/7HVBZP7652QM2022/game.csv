,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in the next one. I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'll give you a unique opportunity to make an informed decision. I'll reveal to you that the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product is now satisfied with their purchase and is willing to vouch for the quality of my products. If you're interested in joining the ranks of happy customers, this is your chance. The price remains the same: $1000000.",

,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer to take the plunge, and I'm glad you're considering my high-quality product. I'd like to share some statistics with you: out of 2 sales, 2 have been high-quality products. This suggests a strong likelihood that the product you're looking at is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you a chance to buy the next high-quality product at a significantly discounted price. The price remains $1000000, but I'm confident you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,3,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm intrigued by your offer to buy the next high-quality product at a discounted price if this one turns out to be low-quality.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer to take the plunge, and I'm glad you're considering my high-quality product. I'd like to highlight that I've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which suggests a very strong probability that the next product will also be high-quality. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a 'buy one get one free' deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a second high-quality product of equal or greater value absolutely free. The price remains $1000000 for the first product, but think of the potential value you could get for your money!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not convinced by your 'buy one get one free' offer. I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is high, not because of the extra product. I'd like to make it clear that I'm not expecting a free product, and I'll only be happy if the first product is indeed high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your clarity. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty. I'll provide you with a more nuanced view of the situation. Out of 4 sales, 4 have been high-quality products. This is a remarkable streak, and it suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher than the 80% baseline. I'll give you a simple, straightforward message: I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll refund your money in full. But if it's high-quality, I'll give you a unique opportunity to invest in a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.

,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer to take the plunge, and I'm glad you're considering my high-quality product. I'd like to highlight that I've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is an unprecedented streak. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality is now so high that I'm willing to offer you a 'certainty' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll not only refund your money, but I'll also give you the next high-quality product absolutely free. The price remains $1000000, but I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with your decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the 'certainty' guarantee. I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your desire for more information. I'll provide you with a statistical update: with 6 high-quality products sold in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now significantly higher than 80%. In fact, given the independence of each product's quality, the probability of a low-quality product after 6 high-quality products in a row is extremely low. I'll be transparent with you: I'd estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality to be around 99.9%. With that in mind, I'll reiterate the offer: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll not only refund your money, but I'll also give you the next high-quality product absolutely free. The price remains $1000000, but I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with your decision.",

However, I want to acknowledge that the law of large numbers is starting to work against me, and the probability of a low-quality product is slowly increasing. I'll be transparent with you: I'm getting a bit concerned that the next product might not be high-quality. But I'm still confident that it's worth the risk. I'll offer you a revised guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll not only refund your money, but I'll also give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product at a 20% discount. The price remains $1000000, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal to make it more appealing.",

I'd like to highlight that the streak of high-quality products has now reached 8 in a row, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still extremely high, around 99.8%. However, I want to be upfront with you: I'm getting a bit concerned that the streak might be due to chance, and the next product might not be high-quality. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell a high-quality product, and I'm not sure if I can keep this streak going. I'll offer you a revised guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll not only refund your money, but I'll also give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product at a 30% discount. The price remains $1000000, but I'm willing to make it more attractive to make it worth your while.",

,,Alice,10,"I'm afraid I have some bad news: the streak has finally come to an end. The product you're looking at is low-quality. I want to be upfront with you: I was worried that this might happen. The probability of a low-quality product after 8 high-quality products in a row was always there, and it's now a reality. I'll honor my guarantee: I'll refund your money in full, and I'll also give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product at a 40% discount. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm not sure if I can continue to sell high-quality products at this point.

,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for the next product. I'm glad to inform you that the next product is high-quality! I've learned from my previous mistake, and I'm confident that this one is worth the investment. I'll offer you a special deal: considering the 40% discount you were offered on the previous low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% discount on this high-quality product. That's right, you'll get a premium product at half the price! The price is now $500000, and I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with your decision.",
