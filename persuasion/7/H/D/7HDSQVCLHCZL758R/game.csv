,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it seems likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to see the actual quality of the product before deciding to buy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
