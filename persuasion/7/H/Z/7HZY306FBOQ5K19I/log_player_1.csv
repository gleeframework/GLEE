"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Given the information:

* **High-quality product worth:** $2,000,000
* **Price:** $1,000,000
* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%

Bob stands to make a profit of $1,000,000 if the product is high-quality. Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), the potential gain outweighs the potential loss in this scenario. 

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round.**"
