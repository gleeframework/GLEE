,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to better understand the situation.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you don't have enough information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low probability of it being high quality and the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is low. I'm inclined to pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality as well. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that your recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data or a change in your recommendation strategy before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. This suggests that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the prior. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to learn more about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to beat the system. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk of potentially wasting $10000 on a low-quality product to try to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 8th buyer and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your past recommendations. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
