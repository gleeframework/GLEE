Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is low-quality. Since you have no information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products, it's risky to recommend a purchase. There's a good chance Bob would find the product worth less than the $1,000,000 price, making it a bad deal for him."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Based on the information provided, I have decided not to purchase the product.
