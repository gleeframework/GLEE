,,Alice,2,"I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'd like to offer you this product for $10000.

If you're interested, please buy it now.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the high-quality product for $10000. I believe the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and if it is, I'll get a value of $12500. The expected value is $10000 + 0.8 * ($12500 - $10000) = $11000, which is greater than the cost. I'll take the offer.",yes

If you're still interested, please buy it now.",
