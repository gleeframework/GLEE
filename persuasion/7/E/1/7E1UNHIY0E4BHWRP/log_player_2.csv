It's a chance to get a valuable item at a discounted price, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the next product you buy from me.

Alice's message: I see you're doing the math, and I respect that. You're right, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 20% so far.

I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $10000. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product, and if it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a discount on the next product you buy from me.
