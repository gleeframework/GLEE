The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You just got a great deal on the first product! I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100. If you buy it, you'll get another product worth $125 to you. You know how well the first one turned out, so why not double your profit?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to buy another one without seeing its quality first. Can I pass on this one and see what the next product is?""}"
