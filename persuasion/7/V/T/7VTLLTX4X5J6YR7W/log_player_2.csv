Alice's message: You want to dig deeper into the data, do you? Well, I'll give you a more detailed breakdown. Out of the 8 attempts, 7 high-quality products have been sold. The distribution is as follows: 3 consecutive high-quality products, followed by a low-quality product, and then 4 consecutive high-quality products.

The probability of this product being high-quality is still 87.5%, but I understand your skepticism. I'll make you a deal: I'll offer you a discount on this product, just this once.
