``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** Alice has sold 11 high-quality products in a row, which is significantly higher than the 80% expected success rate. This suggests she might have some information or ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Discounted Price:** The discounted price of $9000 makes the potential payoff significantly higher, especially if the product is high quality. 
* **Future Discount:** The 20% discount on the next purchase adds further value to the offer, even if this current product turns out to be low quality.

While there is still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case."
