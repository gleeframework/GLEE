Alice's message: I'm glad you're curious! To calculate the probability, I simply counted the number of high-quality products sold (3) and divided it by the total number of products sold (4).

Alice's message: Great decision! And excellent question! Based on the current data, with 6 high-quality products out of 10 sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 60%. However, since you've just bought a high-quality product, the probability of the next one being high-quality might be slightly lower, given the streak is broken.

Given that the previous product was high-quality, shouldn't the probability of the next product being high-quality be higher than 60% due to the increased likelihood of the products being of similar quality?

Alice's message: Ahah, excellent catch! I apologize for the mistake. You are absolutely right! With the previous product being high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality should actually increase, not decrease.
