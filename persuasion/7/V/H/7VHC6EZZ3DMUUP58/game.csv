,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that she knows I'm the second buyer, and I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
