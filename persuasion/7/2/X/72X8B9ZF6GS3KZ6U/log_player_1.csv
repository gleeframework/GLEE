"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the expected value of buying the product is positive. Here's why:
    *  There's a 33.33% chance the product is high-quality, worth $120.
    *  There's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality, worth $0.
    *  Expected Value = (0.3333 * $120) + (0.6667 * $0) = $40

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Bob is risking $100 for a potential gain of $20 ($120 value - $100 price). This is a favorable risk-reward profile. 

**Recommendation:** Since the expected value of buying is positive, it is recommended to advise Bob to buy the product in this round."
