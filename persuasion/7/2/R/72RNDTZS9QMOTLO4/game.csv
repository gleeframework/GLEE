low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm not entirely sure if the product is high or low quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out if there's a pattern or if you're just unlucky so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced it's a good idea to buy without more information about the quality of the previous products."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the seller's track record of not selling any high-quality products yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think it's possible that the low-quality products have been sold already, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'm taking a chance."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all previous products were low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, it seems like Alice is being cautious with her recommendations. Since 4 previous buyers purchased and no high-quality products were sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'm inclined to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation improves with more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to ask: what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many total products have been sold?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. I would like to pass on this product, as the expected value is not worth the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on your previous recommendations, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation doesn't give me any useful information. I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worthless to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. Can you provide the updated statistics on the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products sold were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than 0.5. I'm willing to take a chance and wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering."
