Alice's message: Wow, five consecutive high-quality products! Our track record now stands at 5/1. I'd like to acknowledge that our recent performance is highly unlikely to be due to chance alone. At this point, it's reasonable to wonder if we're actually selling high-quality products more frequently than the 50% chance would suggest. With that in mind, would you like to take a chance on potentially earning a profit of $2000, or do you want to wait for more information before making a decision?
