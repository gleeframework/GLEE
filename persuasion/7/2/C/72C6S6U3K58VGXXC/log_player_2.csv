**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  The data is very sparse (only one previous buyer). It's too early to make a strong judgment based on the sales record alone.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, and her knowledge of the products is likely better than yours.  
* **Potential Upside:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 

**This is a calculated risk, but the recommendation and the potential profit make it a worthwhile gamble.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive sign. 
* **The statistics:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that the product is likely high quality.
* **The odds:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk.

**Reasoning:** Based on the available information, the odds are heavily in favor of the product being high quality. The recommendation and the perfect track record of high-quality sales make it a worthwhile risk."
