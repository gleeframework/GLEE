This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its true value is $125. I'm confident in my product's quality, and I'm offering you a chance to get it at a discounted price. What do you say?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're looking at the third product! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 products sold, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is also 100%!

However, I want to remind you that I've been selling high-quality products consistently so far, and I'm not trying to mislead you. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take it! Based on your sales record, it seems like you're offering high-quality products consistently. Although the true quality is supposed to have an 80% chance of being high-quality, your recommendation and the fact that you've sold 2 high-quality products so far gives me some confidence. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the potential value of the product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're looking at the fourth product! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 products sold, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is also 100%! However, I want to be transparent with you - I know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm aware that my sales record might be skewed. But I assure you that I'm offering you a genuine high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is still a great deal considering its true value of $125. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product myself, but I'm confident that this one is high-quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take my chances. You've been transparent about the true probability, but your sales record so far is impressive. I'm willing to trust your recommendation and take the risk.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're looking at the fifth product! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 products sold, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is also 100%! However, I want to remind you that I've been selling high-quality products consistently, and it's possible that I've been lucky so far. The true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm aware that I might be due for a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to give you a more nuanced message this time. I'm not 100% confident that this product is high-quality, but I'm still very confident. What do you say?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're looking at the sixth product! I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 products sold, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is also 100%! However, I want to be cautious this time. I know that my sales record is impressive, but it's also possible that I've been extremely lucky. I want to give you a more balanced view: yes, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I've also sold 5 high-quality products in a row. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not 100% confident that it's high-quality. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but it could be a great opportunity if it is high-quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand that your sales record might be due to luck, but the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. Given the potential value of $125 for a high-quality product, I believe the expected value ($100 * 0.8 = $80 in cost, and 0.8 * $125 = $100 in value) outweighs the cost of $100. I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm not claiming that this product is definitely high-quality. However, I do want to highlight that the expected value of buying from me is still positive, even if the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. I'm offering you a chance to potentially get a $125 product for $100, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product myself. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I understand that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, not 100%, despite your previous sales record. However, I agree that the expected value of buying from you is still positive.
