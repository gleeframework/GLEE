,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the potential discount, Bob! However, I want to clarify that the discount is only applicable to the next product, and it's not a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality.

This next product is low-quality, and I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a good investment.
