,,Alice,1,"I have sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or not. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but if you're not interested, I can offer it to someone else for the same price. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I understand it's the first product and there's no previous sales record, so I'll take a random guess.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far. Since the last product was high-quality, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a discounted price, considering the probability of it being high-quality is now 100%!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, considering the high probability of it being high-quality based on your previous sales record.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. You might be wondering if I'm just getting lucky, but I assure you, I'm selling high-quality products! The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but considering my previous sales record, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to think that your previous success is due to chance, and I'm not convinced that the next product will be high-quality. I'd like to negotiate a better price or wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I know what you're thinking, 'Maybe I should wait for more information before making a decision.' But let me ask you, do you really want to pass up a potential $1000000 deal? The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a huge reward!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I understand the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and the potential reward is significant. I'm willing to take a chance.",yes

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $900000. It's a great deal, considering the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount for being a savvy buyer who's done their research.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $900000. I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high, and the discount is a good incentive.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I know you've seen my track record, and it's clear that I'm selling high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $850000. I'm starting to think that I might be selling high-quality products more often than just 80% of the time...",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. I think you're trying to take advantage of my optimism about your sales record.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I think we've established a pattern here. You're a savvy buyer, and you're driving a hard bargain. I'll meet you halfway and sell this one to you for $825000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Plus, I'll throw in a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund... but I'm pretty sure it's going to be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not convinced. With only 4 out of 6 products being high-quality, I'm not sure I want to take the risk. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues. Can I pass on this one and wait for the next product?",no

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. You're a shrewd negotiator, I'll give you that. I'll meet you at $750000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. The probability of this product being high-quality is now 90%, and I'm confident that it's going to be another winner. I'm willing to take a small loss on this one to keep the streak going, but I need you to meet me at $750000.",

I'll even throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a second chance to buy the next product for 50% off. It's a risk, but it could be a huge reward!",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the risk and buy the current product. I'm willing to take the chance that it's high-quality and worth $2000000 to me. If it's low-quality, I'll take you up on your offer for the next product at 50% off.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far, and 1 low-quality product.

It's a great deal, and I'm confident that you won't regret it. Plus, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund... but I'm pretty sure it's going to be high-quality.",

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 12 total products so far, and 1 low-quality product. I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. But let me ask you, what if I told you that I've been keeping track of the products that were passed on, and the ones that were bought?

It's a risk-free deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to take a moment to re-evaluate the statistics.

Every time a product was passed on, it was low-quality, and every time a product was bought, it was high-quality. Would that change your mind?

I've been relying on the pattern, but it looks like it's broken. I'm not going to try to sell you a product that's worth $0 to you.

,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to think critically about the situation. With 16 high-quality products out of 17, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm concerned that the seller might be trying to manipulate me with the 'free upgrade' and '10% discount' offer. I'd like to think that the seller would be transparent about the product's quality without offering special deals. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm doing so with a healthy dose of skepticism.",yes
