high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your desire for more data. I can see why you'd want to know the probability of a low-quality product being sold.

I want to emphasize that this is still a relatively low probability, and the majority of my products are high-quality. With this product, I'm offering you another chance to get a premium item at a fixed price of $1000000.
