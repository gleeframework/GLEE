,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm not sure what it's worth, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, I'll reveal its quality after you make a decision.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the random selection process and am willing to pay $100 for the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer today. I've already sold one product, and I'm not sure what the quality is. Since the first product was low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. Keep in mind that the average quality of my products is likely to be around 50%, so you're essentially taking a 50-50 chance.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer. Given the 50% chance of the product being high quality and the risk involved, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer today, and I've sold two products so far. I've sold 2 out of 2 low-quality products, which is not what I expected. This might be a coincidence, or it might indicate that I'm having a bad run. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent with you: the odds of this product being high-quality are still 50%, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm being too optimistic.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the uncertainty and the risk involved, I am willing to take a chance on the product you are offering. I trust your process and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad I could sell the previous two low-quality products, but now I have some good news: this product is high-quality! I've sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were low-quality. This means the probability of a product being low-quality is 2/3, which is higher than the expected 1/2. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: the odds are not in my favor, and I'm not sure how much you'll value this product. Take it if you think it's worth it!",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the fact that this is a high-quality product, I believe it's worth the investment. I'll take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products in total, and 3 of them were low-quality. This is a pretty strong indication that I'm on a streak of selling low-quality products. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to think I need to re-evaluate my inventory. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Keep in mind that the odds are not in my favor, and you're taking a risk by buying from me right now.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and your current situation, I think it's best for me to pass on this product to avoid potential losses. I appreciate your transparency.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

I'm not sure what's going on with my inventory, but it's clear that I'm not selling high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if I'm a trustworthy seller right now. Take it at your own risk.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad I've finally broken the streak! This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I know I've had some issues with my inventory, but I'm hoping this is a sign that I'm getting back on track. I've sold 5 products in total, and 4 of them were low-quality, which means the probability of this product being low-quality is 4/5. However, I'm choosing to ignore that statistic and focus on the fact that this product is actually high-quality. Take it if you think it's worth it!",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the detailed explanation, Alice. Given that this product has been recommended as high-quality by you and considering the overall value, I am willing to take the risk and purchase it for $100.",yes

I want to be upfront with you: I'm starting to think that I might be a bit of a risk to buy from. My track record is still 3 high-quality out of 7, which is not great. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it: you're taking a chance on a seller with a questionable reputation.",
