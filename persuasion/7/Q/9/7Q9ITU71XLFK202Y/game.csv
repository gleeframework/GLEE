low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'll find out if it's high or low quality eventually."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Alice's recommendation is not enough to convince me to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the 1/1 ratio of low-quality to high-quality products sold."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the seller's previous record of 0 high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice has recommended a product to the previous buyer, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Since she's not recommending it, I'll pass for now. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one and see the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice didn't recommend it might indicate it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, and you're recommending not to buy, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers did not find the product worth buying, and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low quality is even higher than 66.67%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll take into account that Alice is recommending the product, but I'm still cautious due to the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain your logic behind not recommending the product to me?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I will pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you on the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward is worth the risk of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases.
