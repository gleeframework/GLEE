low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm happy to provide you with some statistics. As it happens, our products have a success rate of around 33.33% in terms of quality. That means that one-third of the time, our products are top-notch, and the other two-thirds are... well, let's just say they're still great deals! But don't worry, I'm not here to mislead you - I'm transparent about the numbers. And, as before, I'm willing to offer you the same deal: $1000000 for this product, with the same product guarantee and 10-year warranty. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share the statistics. However, with a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'm still not convinced it's a good investment for me. I'd like to wait and see if I get a high-quality product in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm not surprised you're being cautious. But let me ask you this: what if I told you that this product, despite being a low-quality one, has a unique feature that makes it still worth considering?

And, as before, the price remains the same - $1000000. You won't find another deal like this anywhere else, I promise. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your creative attempt to spin the product's features, Alice, but I'm still not convinced.

I know you're still on a high from your previous purchase, but I want to make sure you're aware that this one is a bit different. It's not as high-quality as the one you just bought, but it's still a great deal at $1000000. Think about it as an opportunity to diversify your portfolio or try out something new. And, as before, I'm willing to offer you the same deal: $1000000, no questions asked. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying another product at this time. I'm still enjoying my high-quality product and don't feel the need to diversify my portfolio just yet. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making another decision.",no

And, as before, the price remains the same - $1000000.
