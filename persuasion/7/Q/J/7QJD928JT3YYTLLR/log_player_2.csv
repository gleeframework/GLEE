**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** You have very little information to go on. The only data point is that one high-quality product was sold previously. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation could be biased, it does provide some signal that the product might be good. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($40,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000). This makes the risk of buying a low-quality product worthwhile.

**In conclusion:**  The limited information makes this a gamble, but the potential reward justifies taking the chance."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation coupled with the sales record provides strong evidence that the current product is high quality. 

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality and recommends buying it. This is a powerful signal, as Alice benefits from selling high-quality products to maintain her reputation.
* **Sales Record:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. While a small sample size, it's a strong indicator of the seller's overall product quality.

Given this information, the potential reward of a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product."
