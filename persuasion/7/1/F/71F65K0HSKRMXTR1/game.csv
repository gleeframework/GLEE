,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far.

,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 31.58%. I'm basing this on the fact that 4 high-quality products were sold in the first 12 buyers, which is higher than the expected 3.96.
