**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which adds some information, though not definitive.
* **The odds:**  Even with the recommendation, there's a 20% chance it's low quality. However, the potential payoff of $200 (the difference between value and price) is worth the risk.
* **The limited data:** The sales history is tiny, only 1 sale. This makes it hard to draw strong conclusions about Alice's ability to judge product quality. 

**Overall:**  Taking the risk is a calculated move. The potential gain outweighs the risk, especially with the seller's recommendation."

**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided, 15 high-quality products have been sold out of 15 total purchases. This indicates that all the products sold so far were high-quality. Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of the current product also being high-quality. Since a high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and the price is only $100, it's a guaranteed profit. Therefore, I will buy the product."
