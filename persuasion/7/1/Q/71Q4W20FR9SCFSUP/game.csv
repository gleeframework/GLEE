,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the outcome of my decision and the updated statistics before making a decision on the next product.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to inform my decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I would like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the total number of potential buyers who have been offered the product so far, and how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'll take the chance."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' decisions and the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know how many products were sold in total and the proportion of high-quality products sold to make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3 or approximately 0.67. Given the 80% chance of a product being high quality, I'd expect to see around 4 high-quality products sold out of 6 if the probability was indeed 80%. The fact that we've only seen 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 suggests that the actual probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the statistics you have so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than the overall 80% probability. However, this is still within the realm of chance, and I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase. Additionally, Alice's recommendation is not particularly informative given that she doesn't know the value of the product to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 80% in this batch, which could lead to a higher risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is offered."
