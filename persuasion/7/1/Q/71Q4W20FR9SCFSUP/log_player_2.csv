Given the 80% chance of a product being high quality, I'd expect to see around 4 high-quality products sold out of 6 if the probability was indeed 80%. The fact that we've only seen 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 suggests that the actual probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high quality.""
