I can confirm that the product is indeed randomly selected from a pool of products with equal chances of being high or low quality, as I mentioned earlier.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I like your thinking. With two high-quality products sold in a row, it's natural to wonder if the odds are shifting in our favor. I'd like to assure you that each product is still independently selected with a 50% chance of being high-quality. However, I'll offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of the current streak. I'll give you a special'streak discount' of 5% off the price. The product is now available for $9500. Will you take it?

Alice's message: I see you're a rational buyer who understands the underlying probabilities. I appreciate that. However, I'd like to point out that you've just witnessed two low-quality products in a row, which might be a deviation from the expected 50% rate. This could be a sign that the pool of available products has changed, or it could just be a random fluctuation. Either way, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%.
