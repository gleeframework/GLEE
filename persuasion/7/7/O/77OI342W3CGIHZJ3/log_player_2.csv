**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation coupled with the fact that all 9 previous buyers who followed her recommendation ended up with high-quality products creates a strong positive signal. Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at a 100% discount makes this a worthwhile gamble."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** The seller has a 100% success rate of selling high-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:** The seller recommends buying the product, implying it is likely high quality.
* **High Value:** A high-quality product is worth significantly more than the purchase price.

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the perfect track record and Alice's recommendation make the risk worth taking."
