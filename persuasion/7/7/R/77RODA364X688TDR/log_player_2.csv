Alice's message: I understand your concern about the probability. Let me put it this way: if I were selling low-quality products, I'd be trying to sell them to you, and I'd have already sold 2 products. But I've only sold 2 products in total, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means the remaining product is more likely to be high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000, a 25% discount from its true value. It's a calculated risk, but I'm confident you'll make a profit.
