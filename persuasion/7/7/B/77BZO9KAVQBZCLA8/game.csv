,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Given your past recommendations, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. However, I'll take the risk and buy it, as I'm the 3rd buyer and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and get a good deal."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous buyers? Were they all low-quality? If so, that would make me even more cautious about buying this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd rather not take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality, so I can update my understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that you think it's low quality, which would be in line with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 9th buyer and I don't have enough information to make a rational decision based on the statistics. I'm essentially guessing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind the recommendation?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, since none of the high-quality products have been sold. I'm not convinced by her recommendation and would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since you haven't recommended any high-quality products to anyone so far, it suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance and buy it, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it just based on the statistics or is there something else?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, but the lack of sales suggests that it might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, and I'd like to see the statistics again after this sale to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance. I know you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality and the potential $300 reward if it's high quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
