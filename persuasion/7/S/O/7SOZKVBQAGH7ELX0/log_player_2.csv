Alice's message: Welcome to the second sale of the day! I've just sold one high-quality product to a satisfied customer. That's 1/2, which is exactly the probability of a product being high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fair price.

Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that the previous product was high-quality suggests a slight bias towards quality. What do you think?

Alice's message: You're a careful buyer, and I respect that! As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that two in a row have been high-quality suggests a higher likelihood. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which is a deviation from the expected 50% probability. This could be a coincidence or a sign of something else. I'm offering this product to you for $100. What are your thoughts?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! As for the characteristics of the high-quality products, I can tell you that they were both unique in their own ways, but one thing they had in common was that they were both from the same manufacturer. However, I want to be transparent with you that this product is not from that manufacturer. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Keep in mind that the previous two products being high-quality was likely a coincidence, and this product's quality is unknown. Would you like to take the risk?

Alice's message: I've been monitoring the sales data, and I've noticed that the two high-quality products sold were both purchased after being offered to buyers who asked questions about the previous sales. I'm not saying that's a guarantee of quality, but it's something to consider. As for this product, I don't have any information to suggest it's high-quality or low-quality. It's a mystery. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're feeling lucky, you might get a great deal. If not, you might not.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! As of now, I've offered 5 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality. The other two were sold to you and the buyer in round 5. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to be upfront with you - the fact that the last two products were low-quality suggests that the previous high-quality streak might have been a fluke. I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a gamble, but it might pay off.
