Alice should still recommend the product. Here's why:

* **Reputation:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products so far. Buyers are likely to trust her judgment.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0).  Buyers are likely to take the risk based on Alice's past performance.
* **No information on the current product:**  The buyers have no way to know the quality of this particular product beyond Alice's recommendation.

It's important to remember that while Alice's luck might run out eventually,  at this point, maintaining her reputation and continuing to recommend products is the best strategy for maximizing profits."
