"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **Potential Value:**  There's a 50% chance the product is high-quality, which Bob values at an unknown amount.
* **No Loss:** If the product is low-quality, Bob loses the $10,000.  However, if the product is high-quality, he potentially gains a significant value exceeding the price. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product is balanced by the potential reward of a high-quality product. 

While Bob doesn't know the quality, the potential upside justifies the risk in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is low-quality this round.  You should **not** recommend Bob buy it. Here's why:

* **No Value:**  Bob has already experienced buying a high-quality product in the previous round. Now, you know this particular product is low-quality. There's no chance of it exceeding the $10,000 price tag.
* **Loss Guaranteed:**  Buying this product guarantees a loss of $10,000 for Bob. There's no potential for upside gain. 

Since you have information about the product's quality, it's your responsibility to steer Bob towards a better decision and avoid a guaranteed loss."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the low-quality product in Round 2, it's still beneficial to recommend the high-quality product in Round 3. Here's why:

* **Uncertain Value:** Bob doesn't know the value of a high-quality product. While he might be hesitant after the previous round,  the potential for significant gain is still present. 
* **Risk/Reward Remains:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product is always there, but the reward of potentially buying a high-quality product that could be worth more than $10,000 remains a good gamble for Bob.

As Alice, your role is to provide information and let Bob make informed decisions. The potential for profit from a high-quality product remains a valid incentive for Bob."
