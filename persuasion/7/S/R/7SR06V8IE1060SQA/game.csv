,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'll be transparent with you, and for the next 19 rounds, I'll tell you the quality of each product. If you buy this one, I'll offer you the next product, which will be either high-quality or low-quality, and you'll know its quality. If you don't buy this one, I'll just offer you the next one without any additional information.",

Think about the potential value of that high-quality product, and consider whether $10000 is a good deal for a potential high-quality product.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the incentive, Alice, but based on the probabilities and my strategy, I believe it's best for me to continue passing on these low-quality products. The potential for a high-quality product in the future is intriguing, but I'm committed to maximizing my expected value. Thank you for your understanding.",no
