This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. The price remains at $1,000,000, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. What do you say?""

"Bob's message: I appreciate the reassurance and the offer of a free inspection report. However, I'd like to gather more data on your offerings before making a purchase.

Out of the first three products I've offered, two have been high-quality, and one has been low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is around 66.7%.

While the discounted price is more attractive, I'm still trying to gather more data on the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products.

If, in the future, I offer a product that is actually low-quality, you'll get a refund of the difference between the low-quality product's price and the high-quality product's price. This way, you'll have a safety net, and you can feel confident in your purchase. The price remains at $1,000,000, but I think the added security is worth considering. What do you say?""

While the quality guarantee sounds appealing, I'm not sure how it will play out in practice. I'm also concerned that you might be trying to create a sense of urgency or obligation.
