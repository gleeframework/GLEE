,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price! It's a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a steal!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's a steal, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a fixed price of $100 when it's worth $200 to me. I'd like to wait and see the next product.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me sweeten the deal! I'll throw in a special bonus feature that's only available with this product. It's worth an additional $50 to you. Now, the total value of this product is $250, and I'm still only asking for $100. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the bonus feature, but I'm still not convinced. I know the product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd like to see the next product.",no

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
