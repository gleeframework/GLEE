Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to buy a low-quality product, even at a lower price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still not convinced.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to be transparent. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, and I hope it's indeed high-quality. I'm willing to pay the $1000000 for it.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick again.

If the answer is yes, then I'm willing to offer you a deal. I'll give you a high-quality product, and we can discuss the price together.
