high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 4 products sold was high-quality, which is lower than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
