,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to clarify that your recommendation is not a factor in my decision. I'm buying solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you provide the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you concerned that the product is low-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended against the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the product's quality or the overall sales record?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm suspicious that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers were all recommended to pass or because of the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer might get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than the observed proportion of high-quality products sold. I'm going to pass on it and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low quality, which would explain why you're not recommending it. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is 0, and I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy it and see what happens."
