high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the information you have so far. Is there any information that would make you recommend this product over others?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality and why you're not recommending it? Is there any information that might change my decision?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know that 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, which is a 100% success rate, but I also know that this is likely due to the law of small numbers and the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate so far.

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll take the product and see what I get."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making my decision. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/3. However, this is not the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, as I have access to the seller's previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what are the chances of the current product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you concerned about the low overall quality of the products sold so far?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. However, this is a biased sample, as the high-quality product is worth more to you than the low-quality product, which may have been sold more frequently. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better idea of the true proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold, based on the previous sales record.

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3.
