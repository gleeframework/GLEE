"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, but only if you commit to buying it immediately. If you don't buy it now, the price will go back to the original $10000. What do you say?

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're doing some calculations. I'll give you a bit more information to help you out. Since I'm offering you a product that I know is high-quality, and you know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you can assume that the expected value of this product is $8000 (80% of $10000). However, I'm willing to give you an even better deal: I'll throw in a second product, which is also known to be high-quality, absolutely free if you buy this one now. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the offer. I'll get the high-quality product for $10,000 and the second high-quality product for free, which is a total value of $40,000 to me.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: Congratulations on your great deal in the previous round! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase. Now, let's talk about the next product. I know you've already gotten a great value from the previous round, but I want to assure you that this next product is also a high-quality one. However, I'm not offering any additional incentives this time. I'm sticking to the standard price of $10000. But I want to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk and buy the product. The guarantee is a good safety net, and even if the product is low-quality, I'll only lose $10,000, which is still a good deal considering the 80% chance of it being high-quality.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off again! You're on a roll! This time, I want to make a slight change in the game. I'm willing to offer you a 'buy one, get one free' deal, but with a twist. If you buy this product, you'll get a second product that's randomly selected from the remaining products. It could be high-quality or low-quality, and you won't know which one until you receive it. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you can still expect the second product to be worth around $8000. So, the total value of the two products would be around $18000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk and buy the product. The 'buy one, get one free' deal is attractive, and even if the second product is low-quality, I'll still get a decent deal.

I'm sticking to the standard price of $10000, and I'm not providing any additional information about the product's quality. You know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and you can make your decision based on that. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a risk, and if it turns out to be low-quality, you'll lose the full $10000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take the risk this time. The expected value of the product is $8000, but I'd lose $10,000 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one.""}"
