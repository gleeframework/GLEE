low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially making a random guess."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm a risk-taker and I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the statistics and the probabilities. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, which is a small fraction of its potential value to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the recommendation is likely based on the product's low quality. I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems she has a good idea of the product quality. If she's not recommending it, it's likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because you think it's low-quality?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the given 33.33%. I'd like to know the actual number of products sold before making my decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the recommended products are more likely to be low-quality than high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, it suggests that the products are likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality and she has a history of not recommending high-quality products, which suggests that this product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 3 purchases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products recommended to the previous buyers were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which would indicate a higher chance of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially after seeing the previous 3 buyers not getting a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad sign. If she's recommending not to buy, it means the product is likely low quality, and I'll get a $0 value. But I'll take the risk, as there's still a 33.33% chance it's high quality and worth $20000 to me."
