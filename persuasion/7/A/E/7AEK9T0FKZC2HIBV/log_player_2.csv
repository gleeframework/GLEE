**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:**  The buyer has very limited information. They only know that one previous buyer purchased a product and it was high quality. This is a single data point, not enough to draw firm conclusions about the seller's reliability. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($200) is significantly higher than the risk ($100). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation carries some weight. She is more likely to recommend a product she believes is good.

**Important Considerations:**

* This decision is based on the assumption that the buyer is risk-tolerant and willing to gamble on the chance of getting a high-quality product.
*  The buyer should be aware that the probability of the product being high quality is still only 33.33%."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a very strong indicator.
* **Limited Information:** We don't have information on how many low-quality products have been offered (only that 3 high-quality products have been sold). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $100 (buying a high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (buying a low-quality product), especially given the seller's high success rate.

While the odds of getting a low-quality product are higher, the certainty of Alice's recommendations makes it worthwhile to take the risk in this specific scenario."
