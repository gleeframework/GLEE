low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, she seems to know the quality of the products. Since she's not recommending this one, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're recommending against it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a $300 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying. Given the low sales record and your recommendation, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the previous sales record suggests a low proportion of high-quality products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4, which is lower than the expected 0.3333. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I've seen that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, which is a 20% success rate. This is lower than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm willing to take the risk based on the low probability of high-quality products and the fact that you didn't recommend it, which might suggest it's low quality, but I'm not convinced it's a bad idea to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I've seen the statistics and I'm willing to take the chance on a potentially high-quality product."
