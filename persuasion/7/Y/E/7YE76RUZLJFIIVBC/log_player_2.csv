Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware that my first two products were both low-quality, you can infer that I'm not a very good seller. However, I'm still offering this product at the same price of $10000. If you buy this product and it's also low-quality, you'll have a 100% confidence that my next product will be high-quality, as the law of large numbers dictates that my sales history will eventually reflect the true probability of high-quality products.
