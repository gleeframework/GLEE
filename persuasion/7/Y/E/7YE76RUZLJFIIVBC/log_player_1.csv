Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware that my first two products were both low-quality, you can infer that I'm not a very good seller. However, I'm still offering this product at the same price of $10000. If you buy this product and it's also low-quality, you'll have a 100% confidence that my next product will be high-quality, as the law of large numbers dictates that my sales history will eventually reflect the true probability of high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product?""

I'd like to offer this high-quality product to you at the price of $10000. Given the updated sales history, you can infer that the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher than before. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""
