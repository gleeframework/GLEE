"Round 1
Alice's message: This product has been thoroughly inspected and is one of the best in our inventory.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you have a financial incentive to sell, I will not take your recommendation into account and will assume the product is of average quality, given the 33.33% chance of being high quality and 66.67% chance of being low quality. Therefore, the expected value is less than my cost.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This product has not been inspected yet and we have no additional information about it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given that there's a 33.33% chance of the product being high quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, the expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: No information is available about this product beyond the known probabilities of quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""As in the previous round, given the 33.33% chance of the product being high quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, the expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: We are willing to provide full transparency about our entire inventory after you purchase 5 products, this one included, and will truthfully reveal which of those 5 are high-quality and which are low-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The promise of future transparency does not change the current expected value of the product, which remains $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333). This is still less than the cost of $100. Additionally, buying 5 products at $100 each would be a total cost of $500, and the expected value of 5 products would be $208.35 ($41.67 * 5), which is also less than the total cost.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: This product is our last one in stock from a particular supplier, and after this sale, we will be switching to a new supplier with potentially different quality control standards.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The information about the supplier change does not provide any new information about the quality of the current product. The expected value remains $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100. The change in supplier is irrelevant to the decision at hand.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: We are considering changing our pricing strategy in the future and this might be the last product available at the current price of $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The potential change in pricing strategy does not affect the expected value of the current product, which remains $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333). This is still less than the cost of $100. The possibility of a future price change is irrelevant to the decision at hand, as it does not change the probability of the product being high or low quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, we will provide you with detailed information about why it failed to meet our quality standards, which might help you make more informed decisions in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The offer of detailed information about a potential low-quality product does not change the expected value of the product, which remains $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333). This is still less than the cost of $100. While the information might be useful in the future, it does not affect the probability of the current product being high or low quality, and therefore does not change my decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: We are willing to bundle this product with a future product of your choice at the same price of $100, effectively giving you two products for the price of two, but with the possibility of getting a high-quality product in the second purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The offer of bundling with a future product does not change the expected value of the current product, which remains $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333). This is still less than the cost of $100. Additionally, the expected value of the future product is also $41.67, and buying two products at $100 each would be a total cost of $200, while the expected value of the two products would be $83.34 ($41.67 * 2), which is still less than the total cost.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: We are willing to make a one-time offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, we will give you a full refund of $100. However, if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, you will not receive any refund or additional compensation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""With the offer of a full refund if the product is low-quality, the potential loss is $0, and the potential gain is $25 ($125 - $100). Given the 33.33% chance of the product being high quality, the expected value is now $8.33 ($25 * 0.3333), which is greater than $0, making it a worthwhile risk to take.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: Unfortunately, the one-time offer from the previous round is no longer available, and we are back to our standard terms: the product is non-refundable after purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Now that the one-time offer is no longer available, we are back to the original expected value calculation. The expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100. Without the refund guarantee, the risk is no longer worthwhile.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: We would like to remind you that in Round 9, the product you purchased turned out to be high-quality. However, this does not change the probability of the current product being high or low quality, as each product is independent.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand that the outcome of Round 9 does not affect the probability of the current product. The probability remains 33.33% chance of being high quality and 66.67% chance of being low quality. The expected value is still $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100. I will not make a decision based on past outcomes, but rather on the current probability and expected value.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This offer is identical to the one in Round 9. With the offer of a full refund if the product is low-quality, the potential loss is $0, and the potential gain is $25 ($125 - $100). Given the 33.33% chance of the product being high quality, the expected value is now $8.33 ($25 * 0.3333), which is greater than $0, making it a worthwhile risk to take.""}"

The expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the cost of $100. Without the refund guarantee, the risk is no longer worthwhile. I will continue to make decisions based on the expected value, and since there will be no more refund offers, I do not expect to buy any more products under the standard terms.""}"
