low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no prior data to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales is low, or is there something else I should consider?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like there's a high chance it's low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the expected value is 33.33% * 400 = 133.33. However, since the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm going to pass on it and see if the next buyer will have a better luck."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know why you wouldn't recommend it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product? If so, I'd like to know the probability of that."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which makes me suspect it might be high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a new recommendation or get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. If all previous buyers had high-quality products, the probability of a high-quality product would be 0.25 (1/4), which is lower than the base probability of 0.3333. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely lower than the base probability, making it a good opportunity to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and the low sales of high-quality products so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that you don't recommend it and the low sales record of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. If the probability is low, I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because you think it's low quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want it to be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations. If all 5 previous buyers got low-quality products, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'll take the chance and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
