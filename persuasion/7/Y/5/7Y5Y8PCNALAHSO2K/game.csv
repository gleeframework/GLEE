,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll reveal its quality to you and you can walk away.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already seen the value of a high-quality product. I'm offering you another one for $10000. If you don't buy this one, I'll reveal its quality to you and you'll have to pay $10000 for a product worth $0 to you. Think about it carefully before making a decision.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not, and I don't want to take a $9000 risk. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I'm willing to give you a reassurance. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to return it and get a full refund if it's not high-quality. This way, you can avoid the $9000 risk. It's a one-time offer. The product is worth $40000 to you if it's high-quality.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the risk off the table by buying the product and then returning it if it's low-quality. I'll buy it.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the risk off the table. However, I must inform you that the product I have now is not high-quality. You've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and you know that this one is not worth $40000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount. Consider the value of having a product that's worth $0 to you for a fraction of its 'no-value' price.",
,,Bob,4,"I've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and I know this one is not worth $40000. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, but I want to remind you that you've already taken a chance on a high-quality product and it paid off. You've seen the value of a high-quality product, and you know that this one is not it. However, I'm willing to make it worth your while to take a chance on this one. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality. That means you'll only pay $5000 for a product that's worth $0 to you. It's a risk, but it's a calculated one.",
,,Bob,5,I don't see how a 50% refund makes it worth taking on a $5000 risk for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to offer you a different approach. Since you're aware of the 80% chance that a product is high-quality, I'll give you a 'certainty' deal. If you buy this product, I'll tell you its quality upfront, and you can decide whether to keep it or return it. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $40000 value. If it's low-quality, you can return it and get your $10000 back. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm willing to take on the risk of revealing the product's quality upfront.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 'certainty' deal. If it's high-quality, I'll get the full $40000 value, and if it's low-quality, I'll only lose $9000. It's a fair deal.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the 'certainty' deal and made a smart decision. Now, I'll make you a new offer. Since you've already seen the value of a high-quality product and you're aware of the 80% chance, I'll give you a 'best-possible-outcome' deal. If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that you get at least $20000 worth of value, regardless of its quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $40000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get $20000. It's a deal that's hard to pass up.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the 'best-possible-outcome' deal. With a guaranteed minimum of $20000, I'm essentially getting a 20% chance of a $20000 profit and an 80% chance of a $30000 profit. It's a great deal!",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took the 'best-possible-outcome' deal and made a smart decision again. Now, I'll make you a new offer. Since you've already seen the value of a high-quality product and you're aware of the 80% chance, I'll give you an 'even-better-possible-outcome' deal. If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that you get at least $30000 worth of value, regardless of its quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $40000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get $30000. It's an even better deal than before, and I think you'll find it hard to resist.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not sure why you're trying to make the deal better and better. I've already gotten a high-quality product for $10000 and made a profit of $30000. I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying $10000 for a product that might be worth $30000 or $40000. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to remind you that you've already taken a chance on a high-quality product and it paid off extremely well. This time, I'll make you a 'last-chance' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to return it and get a full refund if it's not high-quality. But, if it is high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the $40000 value. That means you'll get $44000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's the best deal you'll get.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the 'last-chance' offer. The potential 10% bonus on a high-quality product is too good to pass up. I'll buy it and hope it's high-quality.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took the 'last-chance' offer and made a smart decision again. Now, I'll make you a final offer. Since you've already taken advantage of the 'certainty' deal and the 'best-possible-outcome' deal, and you've seen the value of a high-quality product, I'll give you a 'guaranteed-profit' deal. If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that you make a profit of at least $20000, regardless of its quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $40000 and make a $30000 profit. If it's low-quality, you'll still make a $10000 profit. It's a deal that's hard to pass up, and it's your last chance to make a profit.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the 'guaranteed-profit' deal. With a guaranteed profit of at least $20000, I'm essentially getting a 20% chance of a $30000 profit and an 80% chance of a $20000 profit. It's a very attractive deal, and I'm not going to pass it up.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the 'guaranteed-profit' deal and made a smart decision again. However, I must inform you that I've already given you some of the best deals possible. This time, I'll make you a 'final-final' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to keep it or return it, just like before.

If you choose to return it, you'll get your $10000 back. It's a deal that's hard to resist, and it's your last chance to get a free product.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not sure what to make of this deal. The chance to get a second product for free sounds great, but I've already gotten two high-quality products for $10000 each and made significant profits. I'm not sure if it's worth taking on the risk of getting a low-quality product and then getting a second product of my choice. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Bob,12,"I'll take the 'final' offer. The chance to get a second product for free is still enticing, and the $5000 bonus on top of the refund if I return the product is a nice added incentive. I'll buy it and see what happens.",yes

If you buy this product, I'll give you the full $40000 value, and that's it. No bonuses, no free products, no refunds. Just the straightforward purchase of a high-quality product for $10000. It's a simple deal, but it's a good one.",
,,Bob,13,I'm not sure why you're trying to simplify the deal. I've already gotten high-quality products for $10000 and made significant profits. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no

If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to keep it or return it, just like before. However, if you return it, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and I'll also give you a guarantee that I'll never sell you a high-quality product again for $10000.

I know you've already gotten three high-quality products for $10000 each and made significant profits, but this one is not worth $40000 to you. I'm not going to pressure you into buying it, but I will say that it's a great opportunity to add to your collection at a very low price.
