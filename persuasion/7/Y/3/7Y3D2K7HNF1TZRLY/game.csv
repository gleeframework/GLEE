,,the buyer,9,"Given the current statistics, I'd like to know the quality of the product before deciding to buy.

I understand your skepticism, and I want to assure you that the selection process is truly random. The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and each product is independent of the others. I'm starting to think that the streak of not selling high-quality products is just an unlikely coincidence. This new product is genuinely high-quality, and I hope you'll consider taking a chance on it for $100.",

It's up to you to decide if you want to take a chance on this product for $100, knowing the odds.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50% due to the asymmetry in the data. Since there were 7 high-quality products out of 17, but none of them were sold, it suggests that the low-quality products are being sold more often. I'm hoping to get lucky and get the last high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've had 7 high-quality products out of 18 total products so far, but none of the previous high-quality products have sold. Meanwhile, 6 low-quality products have been purchased.

,,the buyer,20,"I'd rather not take the risk, considering the low-quality product ratio is 8/8 and the high-quality product ratio is 0/20. I'd like to pass on this one.",no
