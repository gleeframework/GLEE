Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the probability calculations! Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the probability of 3 high-quality products in a row being a streak of chance is approximately 20.96%. This means that the streak is still within the realm of possibility. As for the probability of the next product being high-quality, it remains at 80%.

Alice's message: Congratulations to our previous buyer on their purchase! As promised, I'll provide the analysis of the low-quality product. Our investigation revealed that the manufacturing process was compromised due to a temporary equipment malfunction, which led to a batch of subpar products.
