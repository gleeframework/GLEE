high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,

,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, and what's the probability of it being high quality based on the current sales record.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation is not a guarantee of quality, and I've seen that you've recommended products to two previous buyers who didn't end up buying. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing this despite your recommendation, not because of it.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to take a risk and pass. I'm hoping that the 4th product is more likely to be high-quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,

,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that this product is high-quality based on the statistics so far.",

,,Alice,18,no,,0.3125
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make the probability of the next product being high-quality higher.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,,
