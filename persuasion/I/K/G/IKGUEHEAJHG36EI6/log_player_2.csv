**Explanation:**

* **The information is positive:** 8 out of 8 products recommended by Alice turned out to be high-quality. This suggests a strong pattern of Alice accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **No risk:** The recommendation is the only piece of information we are given about the specific product. Since the recommendation has been perfect so far, it makes sense to trust it.
* **Potential reward:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($120 value to you).
