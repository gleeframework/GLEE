,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I'm not sure what the product's quality is, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reasoning behind Alice's recommendation and what the statistics are on the products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more sales of high-quality products before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the potential discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the statistics suggest that you've recommended low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the odds are still 33.33% in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what you know about the product's quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what's the probability of this product being high-quality based on that data?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality and Alice's recommendation being accurate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a 'no' recommendation from you and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
