low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me! However, I want to be transparent with you - my previous two sales were a bit too easy, and I'm starting to worry that I might have been too optimistic about my sales record. Let me correct that - I've actually sold 2 out of 2 products, but I'm not sure if they were both high-quality. I'm offering this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront about the uncertainty. It's still a great deal, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks.",

I'm offering this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront about the possibility that it might not be worth the price.

I'm offering this next product to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are extremely low that it's a high-quality product. You're basically buying a coin flip for $10000.",
