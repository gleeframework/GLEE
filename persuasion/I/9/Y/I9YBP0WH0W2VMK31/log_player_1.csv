Let me give you a breakdown of the data: out of the last 5 products I've offered, 2 were high-quality, 2 were low-quality, and 1 was an anomaly. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it, but the numbers are what they are. If you're willing to take a chance on the next product, I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount, making it $800,000.
