low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice recommends buying the product, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (0 out of 2), I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the previous sales record, and so far, none of the high-quality products have been sold, which suggests a bias towards low-quality products being recommended. I'd like to see the next product and make a decision based on the updated statistics."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality or is there another reason?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is high. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation and the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass and see if you'll sell it to the next buyer or discard it."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
