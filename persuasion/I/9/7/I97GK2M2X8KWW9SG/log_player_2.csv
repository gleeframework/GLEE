**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is the only piece of evidence. It's not perfect, but it's something. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of a $200 product outweighs the potential loss of $0. 
* **Limited Supply:** Since the product is discarded if not purchased, buying now means we don't risk losing the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product. 

**In essence, it's a gamble, but with the limited information available, buying is the more logical choice.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:**  You know that the chance of a product being high quality is 50%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. This information adds some weight to the likelihood of the product being high quality. 
* **Past Sales:** The fact that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 suggests a strong bias towards high-quality products.  While this could be a coincidence, it's a positive indicator. 
* **Expected Value:** The potential gain of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product, given the current information. 

**It's important to note:** This is a risky decision. There's still a 50% chance the product is low quality. However, given the available information, buying the product is the best strategy to maximize potential gain."
