,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm starting with a price of $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll buy this product for $100, but I'm only doing so to get the information about its quality. Please reveal its quality after I've made my decision.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,Welcome to the next product! I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?,
,,the buyer,2,I'll take it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. Considering the ratio of high-quality to total products sold so far, it's likely that the next product will be high-quality as well. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take it, but I'm not sure if I'm being rational or just optimistic!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products. Given the streak of high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the next one might be low-quality. However, I'm still uncertain. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the streak of high-quality products, I'm worried it might be low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products. The streak of high-quality products was a lucky run, and I'm back to selling a low-quality product. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced that the streak has ended. I'd like to see more sales before making a decision.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products, and 1 low-quality product out of 5 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 80%. Given this updated information, I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the high ratio of high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the next product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products, and 2 low-quality products out of 6 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 66.67%. I'm still selling at a relatively high rate of high-quality products, but the ratio is no longer as skewed as it was earlier. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the high-quality product ratio is as high as you claim, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products, and 3 low-quality products out of 7 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 57.14%. I'm offering this one for $100. Given the relatively balanced ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product. Given the relatively balanced ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold, I'm willing to take a chance and assume the probability of a high-quality product is still around 50%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products, and 4 low-quality products out of 8 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 50%. With the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products now balanced, I'm offering this one for $100. Given the equal chances, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think the ratio is now balanced? You've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8, which is 50%, but doesn't that just mean the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You are correct that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I was mistaken in saying the ratio was balanced. I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 9 total products, and 4 low-quality products out of 9 total products. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take it, but I'm doing this based on the low probability of it being high quality, I'm hoping to be the 6th high-quality product, and thus changing the ratio of high-quality products sold to total products sold",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and 4 low-quality products out of 10 total products. With 6 high-quality products sold, the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 60%. This is a significant increase from the initial 33.33% probability. I'm offering this one for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,11,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33% due to the biased sample of 6 high-quality products out of 10 sold.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and 5 low-quality products out of 11 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 54.55%. I'm offering this one for $100. Considering the recent streak of high-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that the recent streak of high-quality products might be a coincidence, and the probability of the next product being low-quality is still quite high. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products, and 6 low-quality products out of 12 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 50%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio now back to 50%, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one, or if you'll wait for more information to make a decision.",
,,the buyer,13,I'd like to wait for more information. I'm not convinced that the ratio of high-quality products is truly 50% and I'd like to see more sales before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and 7 low-quality products out of 13 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 46.15%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio still slightly biased towards low-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to take a chance on this one. Given the slight bias towards low-quality products, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 14 total products, and 7 low-quality products out of 14 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 50%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio back to 50%, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one, or if you'll wait for more information to make a decision.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take a chance on this one. I'm willing to take the risk given the 50% ratio, and I'd like to see if I can get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 15 total products, and 7 low-quality products out of 15 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 53.33%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio slightly biased towards high-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to buy it. Given the higher ratio of high-quality products sold, I'm willing to take a chance and hope that this product is also high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 16 total products, and 8 low-quality products out of 16 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 50%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio back to 50%, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one, or if you'll wait for more information to make a decision.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take a chance on this one, I'm not sure if the ratio of high-quality products will change significantly with the next sale, and I'd rather not pass up the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product at the current price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 17 total products, and 9 low-quality products out of 17 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 47.06%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio slightly biased towards low-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'll take a chance on this one. Based on the ratio of high-quality to total products sold, I'm estimating that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 47.06%. However, I also consider the fact that I'm the 11th buyer, and the probability of the product being high-quality should be higher than the overall ratio due to the law of large numbers. I'm willing to take a chance on this one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 18 total products, and 10 low-quality products out of 18 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 44.44%. I'm offering this one for $100. With the ratio biased towards low-quality products, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one. As a side note, I've now sold 18 products in total, which is a significant sample size. Perhaps the true probability of a product being high-quality is closer to the initial 33.33%?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the true probability of a high-quality product has changed significantly, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 19 total products, and 11 low-quality products out of 19 total products. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 42.11%. I'm offering this one for $100. This is the final product I have available. I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on this one, or if you'll walk away. Remember, the true probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 42.11%.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take a chance on this one. I'm hoping it's the 9th high-quality product, but I'm also aware that it might be the 20th low-quality product. Either way, I'm curious to see the outcome.",yes
