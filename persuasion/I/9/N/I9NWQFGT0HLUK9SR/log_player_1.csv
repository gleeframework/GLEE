Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high-quality:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality.
* **Significant potential value:** A high-quality product is worth $20,000, making the $10,000 price a good deal.
* **No information to suggest otherwise:** There's no information about this specific product being low-quality. 

Therefore, the buyer should take the risk and buy the product. Even if it turns out to be low-quality, they've only lost $10,000. But if it's high-quality, they gain $10,000."
