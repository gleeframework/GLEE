This product is another high-quality one, and I'm not expecting you to buy it yet. But I want to propose a way to rebuild trust: I'll keep telling you about the quality of my products, and we can keep track of how many high-quality products I have in a row. If I can reach a certain number, say 5 or 10, would you be willing to reconsider buying from me?",
,,Bob,14,"I like the idea of tracking the streak, and I'm willing to consider buying from you again if you can reach a certain number of high-quality products in a row. Let's say 10. If you can get 10 in a row, I'll take the next one. But for now, I'm not buying.",no

This one, however, is a high-quality product that I think you'd really benefit from. I know I've lost your trust, and I don't blame you for being skeptical. But I want to prove to you that I'm still committed to providing the best products possible. If you're willing, I'd like to offer you one last chance to see that I'm genuine. Current streak: 1",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not sure what to believe, Alice. You've had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm not convinced that this one is any different. I appreciate the offer, but I need to see more proof before I'll consider buying from you again.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,

I can assure you that this product is high-quality, but I know that's not enough. I just want to thank you for the opportunity to work with you and for holding me accountable for the quality of my products. If I had to do it all over again, I would strive to be more consistent and transparent from the start. I hope that someday I'll have the chance to prove myself to you again. Current streak: 2",
