"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round, and I'm offering you a unique opportunity to buy a product for $10000. I'm not obligated to disclose the product's quality, but I'm willing to give you a 50% chance that it's high-quality. If you buy, you'll get to know the product's quality afterwards. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this offer.""}"

Round 2

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount from its true value of $12500. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for a product that you're confident is high-quality, given the significant discount from its true value.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to get a good deal on the previous product! For this round, I'm offering you another product, but this time I'm not making any claims about its quality. I'm simply presenting it to you as an opportunity to buy at the same price of $10000. Keep in mind that there's a 20% chance it's high-quality, which would make it a good value, but there's also an 80% chance it's low-quality, which would be a loss. You've already seen that I'm willing to sell low-quality products, so you know what to expect. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product for $10,000. The expected value is $2,500, which is not enough to justify the risk. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

This way, you'll only lose $5000 if it's not high-quality, which is a more manageable risk. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a 50% refund on a $10,000 product. Even with the refund, I'd still be losing $5,000 if it's low-quality, which is not a good deal for me.""}"

If you're not satisfied with its quality, you can walk away and I'll give you a full refund of $10000. If you do decide to buy, you'll get to keep the product, regardless of its quality. This way, you can make an informed decision with no risk. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'm aware of the 80% chance it's low-quality, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of wasting my time inspecting a potentially low-quality product.

This way, you'll only lose $7500 at most, and you'll even get a bonus if the product turns out to be low-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the guarantee. I'd still be losing $7,500 if the product is low-quality, and I don't see why I should pay $10,000 for a product that has an 80% chance of being worthless to me.""}"

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a lot of 5 products.
