You know the product is low-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know this, they do know the following:

* The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.
* You recommended the previous product, which turned out to be high-quality.

This information is likely to make the buyer more optimistic about the quality of this product. However, you know it's low-quality. It's in your best interest to be honest and avoid recommending the product.  You're trying to maximize the number of high-quality products you sell, and recommending a low-quality product will likely result in the buyer refusing to purchase any more products from you."

This means that they can infer that you are more likely to recommend a product when you know it's high-quality. Therefore, even though they don't know the quality of this product, the fact that you are recommending it makes it more likely to be high-quality in their eyes."

* **Your Current Recommendation:** You are recommending this product.
