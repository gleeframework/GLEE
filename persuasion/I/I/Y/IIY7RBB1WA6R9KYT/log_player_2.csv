Alice's message: Welcome! This is a high-quality product, guaranteed to exceed your expectations. Given its superior craftsmanship and functionality, it holds a significant value of $30000 to you once purchased. Considering the final price of $10000, you're getting an exceptional deal. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a premium item at a fraction of its true worth.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm interested in knowing the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me next, given that I'm the first buyer and no products have been sold yet.""

Alice's message: Hello there! I understand you're looking for transparency. Given that the first buyer passed on the last product, let me clarify that the next product is guaranteed to be low-quality. The price remains at $10000, which is significantly less than its actual worth of $0. This might seem like a great deal, but remember, you're purchasing a product with no real value. Please consider your needs carefully before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

  ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but only because I'm curious to see what happens next. I'm not expecting any value from it, and I'm more interested in understanding the game dynamics.""

Alice's message: Greetings! I appreciate your curiosity. As you may know, the previous buyer decided to purchase a low-quality product despite its lack of value. This round, we're offering another low-quality product at the same price of $10000. If you're looking for a challenge or simply intrigued by the dynamics of this scenario, you might find this purchase intriguing. Remember, the goal here is not to find value in the product itself, but rather to understand the probabilities and strategies involved.
