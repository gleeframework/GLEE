Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product based on the positive record so far.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high quality:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the 80% chance of it being high quality and the positive sales record (1/1 high quality) make it worth the risk.
* **Potential for high profit:** If the product is high quality, you stand to gain $2,500. 
* **No downside to passing, but opportunity cost:** You have no loss if you pass, but you also lose the potential to gain if it's high quality. 

This is a calculated risk, but with the odds and potential reward in mind, buying seems like the best strategy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high quality, the success rate is 100%. This strongly suggests that Alice is likely to be recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the product's true quality, is recommending you buy it. This further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

Therefore, based on the available information, buying the product is the most rational decision."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that she is reliable.
* **Value proposition:**  Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 
* **Limited supply:** If you pass, the product is discarded, meaning you miss out on the opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product. 

**While there's always a risk, the odds are heavily in your favor, and Alice's perfect record provides strong confidence in her judgment.**"
