Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. To calculate the probability of this product being high-quality, I used a simple Bayesian update. Given that 4 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, and assuming that the probability of a product being high-quality is independent of the previous products sold, I updated the probability to 4/6 = 2/3 or approximately 67%. I'm glad you found this calculation transparent and helpful. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1150000, the same price as before. Would you like to take it home?

Alice's message: I see your point, and I appreciate your nuanced thinking. You are correct that the probability of a product being high-quality is not independent of the previous products sold. If the first 3 products were high-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 2/3. In fact, using a more nuanced approach, I would estimate the probability of a product being high-quality to be around 80-90%. However, I'm selling this product to you at a discount, as it is low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000, which is a significant discount from the usual price.
