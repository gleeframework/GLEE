A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","With the first buyer having bought the low-quality product, and now having a high-quality product available, I'll try to maximize my chances of selling this one.

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I have sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
