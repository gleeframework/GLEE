**Explanation:**

* **No Sales History:** There is no information to base a decision on except the recommendation from Alice.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is substantial.

This is a gamble, but without any data to go on, it's the only logical choice."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  This strongly suggests Alice has a good ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation further reinforces the positive signal. While not perfect, it adds to the overall evidence.
* **Potential Upside:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst outcome is losing $10,000.  The potential upside of a $12,000 gain is substantial.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The sample size is small (5 buyers). A larger sample would provide more confidence in the data.
* **Alice's Motivation:** It's worth considering if Alice has any incentive to misrepresent the product's quality (e.g., if she gets a commission on sales). 

However, given the limited information and the high potential reward, taking the risk seems like the best decision in this case."
