**Explanation:**

* **High Probability:**  With 4 out of 4 products sold being high quality, the likelihood that this product is also high quality is extremely high. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, coupled with the data, strongly suggests the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,200,000) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**Note:** Even though this scenario is highly favorable, it's important to remember that there's still a small chance (66.67%) that the product could be low quality. However, the information available makes buying the product a calculated and reasonable decision."
