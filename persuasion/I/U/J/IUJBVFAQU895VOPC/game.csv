,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm hesitant to buy without more information.  Given the high risk of a low-quality product, I'd like to see if you can offer any guarantees or a way to test the product before I make a decision."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product.  While I'm disappointed I missed out on a high-quality product last round, your lack of recommendation makes me even more cautious. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm still not convinced.  Two rounds in a row with no recommendations makes me think there's a high probability of a low-quality product. I'll pass again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in this process. Three rounds of non-recommendations in a row, all with low-quality products, makes me believe there's a strong pattern here. I'm going to pass on this one as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, while I appreciate your recommendation, I'm still wary. Four consecutive low-quality products without a recommendation, followed by a sudden recommendation, makes me think you might be trying to push a low-quality product on me. I'll pass for now and see how things unfold."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm still hesitant.  Two high-quality products in a row with recommendations followed by four low-quality products without recommendations makes me believe your recommendations might be unreliable.  I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here.  Three consecutive recommendations for high-quality products after a string of low-quality products makes me question your motives. I'm going to pass again and see how things play out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm losing faith in this process. Four high-quality products in a row with recommendations, followed by four low-quality products without recommendations, leads me to believe your recommendations are not reliable.  I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps we can revisit this later if you can provide me with more convincing evidence about the quality of your products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm sticking to my decision.  The pattern of recommendations and outcomes is still too inconsistent for me to trust.  I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I'm not going to buy it.  Ten rounds in, and I'm still seeing a strong pattern of unreliable recommendations.  I'm starting to believe you're deliberately trying to mislead me, and I'm not going to take that risk anymore."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I'm not going to buy it.  The evidence is clear: your recommendations are inconsistent and untrustworthy.  I've seen a clear pattern of low-quality products following recommendations and vice versa.  I'm not willing to risk my money on your products any longer.  Perhaps if you can offer a more transparent and reliable system, I might reconsider, but as it stands, I'm out."
