"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $125 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and you have no information to go on except Alice's recommendation, it's a gamble.  But, given the 80% chance of high quality, it's a gamble worth taking.  You have a good chance of getting a high-quality product for a price you're willing to pay."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has some value. Since she doesn't know your personal valuation, her recommendation is likely based on some insight about the product's quality. Given her recommendation to *not* buy, and the fact that there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality (worth $0 to you), it's best to pass and avoid the risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass again, Alice. Your recommendation against it makes me wary.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation against buying continues to hold weight.  While her recommendation isn't perfect, it's better to err on the side of caution when there's a risk of getting a worthless product.  This strategy minimizes potential losses and keeps the focus on maximizing gains from high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight. She's likely observing something about the products that we don't, even if her information isn't perfect.
* **Past Experience:** We've seen that Alice's recommendations are not foolproof, but they've been useful in avoiding low-quality products. 
* **Risk-Reward:** The potential reward of a $125 high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product, especially considering Alice's recommendation.

It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward is worth it, particularly since we've had some success following Alice's recommendations in the past."

Alice's recommendation against buying has proven to be useful in the past.  While her recommendation isn't always accurate, it's a valuable indicator, especially when the potential loss (a $0 product) is significant.  We've seen that her recommendation against buying has saved us from low-quality products in the past, so it's best to err on the side of caution in this round."

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice has shown a reasonable track record of recommending high-quality products, even if it's not 100% accurate.
