,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me offer you a different perspective. Sometimes, even the best investments require calculated risks. With this product, you're not just buying a product, you're buying an opportunity to learn and grow. And at a price of $1000000, it's a chance to acquire a unique asset that could potentially increase in value over time.

,,Bob,2,"I still don't see a compelling reason to pay $900000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'm not convinced that the potential upside justifies the risk, especially since I don't know if I'll even get the high-quality product.",no
