Given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the previous buyer might have been unlucky or the product might be low quality.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific you've observed in the previous sales that led you to this decision?"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product to the buyers, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
