low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product and take the risk, as there is no prior information to influence my decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the overall sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase the chances of it being high quality, since you wouldn't recommend it if you thought it was low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics. Since 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that your recommendation is based on your lack of knowledge about my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'm also aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, which is not negligible."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is there any information that led you to this decision?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, it seems the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the product is low quality as well. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, as there are no high-quality products sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 6 products to 6 buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for the fixed price of $1000000, as it's a one-time offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you can tell me more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass on it. Can you reveal its quality first?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you provide the number of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 10, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on it. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
