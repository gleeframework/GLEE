Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad you're enjoying the great deals, but I have to warn you that I'm not going to be able to offer you another deal like that. The previous two high-quality products were a one-time opportunity, and I'm not going to be able to offer you a third high-quality product at a discounted price. The next product I offer will be at the standard price of $10,000, and I'm not sure if it will be high-quality or low-quality.
