low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 products so far. We're starting from scratch, and I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm aware that the odds are against it being high-quality. I'm hoping for a good outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering this next product to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and find out if it's high-quality?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping that my purchase will help you learn more about the products and potentially increase the chances of selling a high-quality product in the future.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. I know it's not what you want to hear, but I assure you that we still have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. We're not giving up! Would you like to take a chance and buy this next product for $100?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"The previous buyers were aware of the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product and were informed about the total number of products sold. One of them even mentioned that they were hoping our sales record would improve. They didn't ask about the quality of previous products, but rather about the probability and the total number of sales. Would you like to take a chance and buy this next product for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' thought process before making a decision. Did they consider the probability of a high-quality product, or were they swayed by other factors?",no

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've sold a total of 7 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. Given our sales record, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% (2/5).

,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and the high probability of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality item for $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've sold a total of 8 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. We've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products, but the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%.

,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make a good decision. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% because of the 3 high-quality products sold out of 10, which is higher than the expected value. I'm not basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, but rather on the fact that I have to make a decision and I don't want to pass on the opportunity.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,"All of our previous buyers were aware of the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product and had access to the same information as you.
