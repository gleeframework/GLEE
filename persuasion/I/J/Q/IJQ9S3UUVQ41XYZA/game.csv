,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, you've been so accurate in the past that I'm really starting to wonder what's going on.  Three rounds in a row you've not recommended a product, and each time it's turned out to be low-quality.  Are you trying to tell me something?  Is there some new information you're using to make your decisions that you're not sharing?  I need some clarity before I can trust your judgment again."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm confused. You've been so good at recommending quality products in the past, but recently, every time you've declined to recommend a product, it's turned out to be low-quality. Now, you're recommending this product after four straight non-recommendations. I need some clarity before I can trust your judgment again. Could you explain why you're recommending this one after your recent behavior?  I'm trying to understand what's changed in your decision-making process."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations.  You've been so good in the past, but recently, your recommendations have been inconsistent, and your non-recommendations have been consistently correct.  I need a better understanding of what's driving your decisions before I can trust your judgment again.  Could you explain why you're recommending this product after your recent pattern of behavior?  I'm trying to figure out what's changed, but I need more clarity."
