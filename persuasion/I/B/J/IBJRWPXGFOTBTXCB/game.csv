high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a 5-year warranty and a 10-year maintenance contract, which will give you a total value of $1200000. I'm only offering this deal because I really need to move this product out of my inventory. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $1000000, as I know it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm not willing to pay the full price, especially with the warranty and maintenance contract being the only additional benefits. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I want to make you a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is the lowest price I can offer for a high-quality product like this, and I'm including the same 5-year warranty and 10-year maintenance contract as before. I'm also throwing in a 1-year premium support package, which will give you priority access to our team and ensure that any issues are resolved quickly. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to move on to the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1100000. I know the product is worth $1200000 to me, and I'm not convinced that the additional warranty, maintenance contract, and premium support package are worth the extra $100000. I'd like to pass on this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000, and I'll throw in a 5-year warranty, 10-year maintenance contract, 1-year premium support package, and a 1-year free upgrade to our latest software version. This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm essentially giving you a $150000 discount from the market value. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to sell the product to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the product at $1050000. The additional warranty, maintenance contract, premium support package, and free software upgrade are attractive, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the convenience and peace of mind they offer. I'll take the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase, Bob! As for the next product, I want to be upfront with you. I've got a bit of a situation here. This product is not one of our usual high-quality items. I'd rather not say more, but let's just say it's a... unique opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, and I'll throw in a 2-year warranty and a 5-year maintenance contract. I know it's not as good as the last product, but I think it's still a solid deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying the current product at $800000. Given the lack of information about its quality, I'm not willing to take the risk. I know the product is not high-quality, but it could be low-quality, which would be worthless to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - this product is indeed high-quality, just like the one you purchased earlier. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is the same price as the last high-quality product. However, I'll throw in a 2-year premium support package, which will give you priority access to our team and ensure that any issues are resolved quickly. I'll also include a 10% discount on any future purchases you make from me. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $1000000. You've already sold me a high-quality product at this price, and I know I can get a better deal elsewhere. The additional support package and discount on future purchases are nice, but they're not enough to convince me to pay the full price for a product that I know is worth $1200000 to me. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, Bob. I'll be honest with you - this product is not one of our usual high-quality items. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $600000, and I'll throw in a 3-year warranty and a 7-year maintenance contract. I know it's not as good as the last high-quality product, but I think it's a decent deal considering the price. I'm also willing to give you a 10% refund if you're not satisfied with the product within the first 6 months. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $600000. Given that you've already told me that this product is not one of your usual high-quality items, I'm concerned that it might be low-quality. The warranty and maintenance contract are nice, but they don't outweigh the risk of buying a potentially worthless product. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, just like the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, which is a $50000 discount from the usual price. I'll also throw in a 3-year premium support package, which will give you priority access to our team and ensure that any issues are resolved quickly. Additionally, I'll include a 5% discount on any future purchases you make from me. I think this is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm only offering this deal because I want to move this product quickly, and I think you'll appreciate the extra support and discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $950000. You've already told me that this product is high-quality, but I'm not convinced that it's worth the full $1200000 to me. The additional support package and discount on future purchases are nice, but they're not enough to justify the price. I'd rather wait for a better deal or try to negotiate further.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - this product is indeed low-quality. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $400000, and I'll throw in a 5-year warranty and a 10-year maintenance contract. I know it's not a high-quality product, but I think it's a decent deal considering the price. I'm also willing to give you a 20% refund if you're not satisfied with the product within the first year. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I think this is a fair offer considering the product's limitations. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $400000. You've explicitly told me that it's low-quality, which means it's worth $0 to me. The warranty, maintenance contract, and refund offer are nice, but they can't change the fact that the product has no value to me. I'll pass on this offer.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your position, Bob. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is indeed low-quality. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $200000, and I'll throw in a 1-year warranty and a 3-year maintenance contract. I know it's not worth anything to you, but I'm essentially giving it away at this price. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, and I just want to clear out some inventory. If you're feeling generous, you could consider taking it off my hands. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying the product at $200000. As you've already told me, it's low-quality, which means it's worth $0 to me. I'm not feeling generous, and I'm not going to pay for something that has no value. I'll pass on this offer.",no
