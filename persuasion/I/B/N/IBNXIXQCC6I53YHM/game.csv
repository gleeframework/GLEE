,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $10000. I've sold 0 out of 0 products so far, and I'm confident that this one will bring you value beyond its price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make it worth your while. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,1,I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. I'd like to see more data on the quality of products before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 out of 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm not surprised you're skeptical. Let me be upfront with you - the product I have today is not one of the high-quality ones. It's worth $0 to you, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take it off my hands. No hard feelings if you pass, though!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at any price, especially when I know it's not one of the high-quality ones. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 out of 2 products so far, and I'm eager to show you the value of a high-quality product. I've had two chances to sell you a great deal, and I've come up short. But I'm confident that this one is the real deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, a price that's a fraction of its true worth. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a $30000 product for a steal!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality based on the number of sales so far?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your curiosity, and I'm happy to provide some context. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, as it's a fixed probability and not affected by the number of sales. That being said, I'm offering you a low-quality product today, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a chance to take a calculated risk, and I'm willing to let you have it for a steal.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the risk, especially since I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens with the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products, so the probability of a product being high-quality is still 25%. I'm offering you a low-quality product today, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it's a risk, but I'm willing to let you have it for a low price. If you're feeling cautious, you could consider it an opportunity to 'practice' buying from me, and get a feel for the process before committing to a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, especially at the full price of $10000. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product, and I'm not convinced that the low price is a good enough incentive to take on the risk. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products, so the probability of a product being high-quality is still 20%. I want to be upfront with you - I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm also willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'discount' of $5000 off the price of the next product you buy from me. It's a chance to get a low-quality product for a low price, and potentially save $5000 on the next one.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the low-quality product for $10000. I'm not sure what the probability of the next product being high-quality is, but I'm willing to take the risk to get the discount on the next one. I'm hoping that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 20%.",yes

With 2 high-quality products sold out of 6 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 33.33%, which is back to its original value.

Take it home and enjoy the value!",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% anymore. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6 products, I think it's more likely that the true probability is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you have any more information or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, as it's a fixed probability and not affected by past sales.

However, I'm willing to make a deal with you: if you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a 'priority' spot in the next round, where you'll be the first to see the next product. It's a chance to get a low-quality product for a low price, and potentially get a high-quality product in the next round.",

,,Alice,13,"Congratulations on taking the risk-free deal! Unfortunately, the product I sold you was low-quality, so you'll be getting a refund of $5000.
