high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation. It's important to feel confident about your investment.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism. You're right to be cautious, especially with a product of this value. While I can't disclose specifics, I can offer you a guarantee: if this product turns out to be low-quality, I will refund you double the purchase price. This is a testament to my confidence in the product's quality and a way to ensure you're protected. Would you be willing to take advantage of this guarantee and consider purchasing the product?",
,,Bob,3,"Your guarantee is intriguing, but I'm not convinced that it changes the fundamental risk of buying a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this one too.",no

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your reluctance, and I respect your cautious approach. I've been carefully evaluating our interactions, and I realize my previous offers may not have addressed your primary concern: the risk of purchasing a low-quality product.  To alleviate this, I'm proposing a new strategy.  Instead of offering a guarantee, I'm willing to sell you this product at a significantly reduced price of $500000.

Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",

,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation.  It's clear you're focused on mitigating risk. I'm willing to offer you something different this time.
