Alice's message: I'll be honest with you, I've had one product before that didn't sell. I believe in transparency. This product may or may not meet your expectations. However, I assure you that the price of $1000000 is non-negotiable. If you're feeling lucky, take a chance and buy this product.

Alice's message: I've had two products that didn't sell so far. I want to remind you that my products are sold as-is, and I've been transparent about my past sales. Although I haven't had a successful sale yet, this product might be the one that surprises you. Consider the possibility that the previous buyers missed out on a great opportunity. The price remains $1000000.

Alice's message: I see a pattern emerging - three products didn't sell, and I'm starting to build a reputation for being transparent about my sales. While this doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling products at the same price point. If you believe that future buyers will be more likely to trust me after a successful sale, you might consider buying this product to take advantage of the potential future value of being one of my early customers. The price remains $1000000.

Alice's message: Five products have come and gone without a sale, and I'm starting to think that my transparency isn't enough to sway buyers. I want to try a different approach. Consider this: if I were to sell only low-quality products, it's unlikely that I would be so open about my sales record. Perhaps, just perhaps, I'm waiting for the right buyer to come along and take a chance on a product that will surprise them. The price remains $1000000, but I assure you that this purchase will be a memorable one, regardless of the outcome.

Alice's message: I've finally made a sale, but I want to be upfront with you - the previous buyer took a chance on a product that didn't have the best odds. And, I'll be honest, this product doesn't either. However, I want to build on the momentum of my first sale and establish a reputation for being transparent about my products. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll make sure to continue being open about my sales record. The price remains $1000000, and I hope you'll consider being my second customer.
