,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy and the seller's recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate, and the products she recommends are likely to be high quality. Since you're not recommending it, I'm going to assume it's a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice recommends it."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice.
