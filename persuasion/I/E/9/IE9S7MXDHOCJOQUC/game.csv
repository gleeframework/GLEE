I'll sell you a product that's not just high-quality, but also has a special feature that I've never offered before. This feature will give you an even greater value and make this product truly exceptional. The price remains the same: $10000. But I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this feature again in the future.",

I'm making my decisions based on the 80% chance of the product being high-quality and our previous successful transactions. The special feature is intriguing, but it doesn't change my calculation.
