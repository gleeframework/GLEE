  ""message"": ""I've now sold 3 high-quality products, and you're interested in calculating the probability. Let me give you some context: I've sold a total of 3 products so far, and 3 of them have been high-quality. If the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, we'd expect to see 2.4 high-quality products out of 3 by chance. Since we've actually seen 3 high-quality products, it's possible that the true probability is higher than 80%. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000.

I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent: the probability of it being high-quality is now lower than 80%. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?""
