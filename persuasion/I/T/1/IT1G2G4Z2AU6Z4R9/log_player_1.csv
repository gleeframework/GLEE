I'll sell this product to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the discount, but given the initial probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'm not convinced that a single sale out of two products changes the overall odds significantly. I'll pass on this one.

However, I want to highlight that I've sold a low-quality product consecutively for two rounds, which suggests that my previous high-quality product might have been an outlier. I'm offering this product to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering the uncertainty surrounding its quality.""}"

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $600,000. It's a low price, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a discount, the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low at 14.29%, and I don't have any information about the current product's quality.
