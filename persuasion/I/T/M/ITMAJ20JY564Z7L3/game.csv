,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, which suggests the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass or for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 2 buyers didn't find the products valuable, and the recommendation from Alice is not a strong indicator of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that all previous buyers passed on the product, it seems like the previous products might have been low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be worth $2000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it's likely that the products were low quality. I'll pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation does not provide enough information for me to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if the product is high-quality, Alice's recommendation might be a signal that she's trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product, which would be a bad deal for me. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%. I'm not convinced to buy it yet."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if a high-quality product has been sold in the past, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
