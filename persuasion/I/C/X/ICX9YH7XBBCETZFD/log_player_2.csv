Alice's message: I've sold one product so far, and it was a high-quality item. The odds of this one being high-quality are 33.33%, but I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the last one, $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering the odds.

Alice's message: I've sold two high-quality products in a row now, which is a bit unusual. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price, $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's still a risk, and the price remains the same. You can take advantage of the potential anomaly, or wait for more information.

Alice's message: I've sold three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 33.33% probability. This suggests that the previous sales were just a coincidence, and the true probability of a high-quality product is actually 33.33%. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, and I want to emphasize that the odds are now back to the original probability. It's a fair price for a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

However, I want to point out that you, as a buyer, have seen the results of my sales so far. You can use this information to inform your decision.

Alice's message: You're now aware of the mix of high-quality and low-quality products I've sold so far. Given the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. However, I want to highlight that I've sold five products now, and if I were to be selling only high-quality products, I would have sold at least 3 high-quality products by now. Since that's not the case, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%. You can take advantage of this opportunity to buy a product at a potentially fair price.
