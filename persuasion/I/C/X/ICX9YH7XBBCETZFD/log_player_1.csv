I'm offering this next product to you for $1,000,000, and I want to emphasize that the odds are now back to the original probability. It's a fair price for a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.""

However, I want to highlight that I've sold five products now, and if I were to be selling only high-quality products, I would have sold at least 3 high-quality products by now.
