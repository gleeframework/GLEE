,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a chance to get a potentially high-quality product for a low price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, which is 10% off the final price. If you decline, the price will increase to $1100000 for the next product.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to pay full price for a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'd rather wait and see the price increase to $1100000 for the next product.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000, which is still a significant discount from the full price of $1250000. It's a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will indeed increase to $1100000 for the next product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not willing to pay $1050000 for it. I'll wait and see if I can get a better deal or if the product is low-quality.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I can see you're a savvy buyer. I'll make you a deal you can't refuse. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount from the full price of $1250000. I'm willing to take on some of the risk, and I'm confident that this product is worth every penny to you. If you decline, I'll have to increase the price to $1150000 for the next product.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for the 'deal you can't refuse' trap. I know the product has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 2/3 chance of being worthless to me. I'll wait and see if I can get a better deal or if the product is indeed high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I want to assure you that this product is not a complete loss. I'll give you a unique opportunity to get a taste of the high-quality products I have to offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $900000. This way, you can get a feel for the product's features and see if it's something you'd be interested in, even if it's not the high-quality version. If you decline, the price will increase to $1200000 for the next product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm not going to spend $900000 on something that's worth $0 to me. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a compromise. Since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at a price that's closer to the market value. I'll sell it to you for $1150000, which is still a discount from the full price of $1250000. Additionally, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will increase to $1250000 for the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality. The guarantee is nice, but it doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being worthless to me. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make you an offer that's hard to refuse. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from the list price. I'm essentially giving it away at this price. If you decline, I'll have to increase the price to $1300000 for the next product, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer such a low price again. This is a one-time opportunity to get a product at an unbeatable price.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to pay $500000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I know you're trying to get rid of it, but I'm not willing to take on that kind of risk. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your stance, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've already had to sell two low-quality products at a loss, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0. Yes, you heard that right, $0. I'm essentially giving it away. If you decline, I'll have to increase the price to $1350000 for the next product, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep offering such low prices. This is a one-time opportunity to get a product for free.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to pass up a free product. I'll take it, even though it's likely to be worthless to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on getting the free product! I'm glad you took advantage of the opportunity. Now, let's move on to the next product. I'll be honest with you, I'm not in a great position after the last few sales. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $100000. I know it's not a great deal, but I'm desperate to get rid of it. If you decline, I'll have to shut down my business, and you'll never see another product from me again.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to pay $100000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I've already made that mistake once, and I'm not going to repeat it. I'll let you shut down your business and take the loss.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make one final offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, just like last time. I'm not kidding, I'll give it to you for free. If you decline, I'll close my business, and you'll never see another product from me again. This is the last chance to get a free product, and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to offer such a deal again.",
,,Bob,9,"I've already taken the bait once, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll take the free product, but I'm not going to pretend like I'm making a good decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I expected as much. Congratulations on getting another free product. However, I'm not going to keep giving them away. I'm shutting down my business as promised, and I won't be offering any more products. You've made your last free product. If you want to buy this low-quality product, the price is $0. But let's be real, you're not going to get another chance to get it for free. If you decline, I'll be gone for good.",
,,Bob,10,"I've had enough. I'll take the free product, but I'm not going to pretend like I'm making a good decision. I've lost $2000000 on two low-quality products, and I'm not going to fall for it again.",yes

,,Bob,11,"Are you kidding me? After two low-quality products and a third one that I paid $1000000 for, you think I'm going to trust you with a high-quality product? I don't think so. I'll let you shut down your business and take the loss.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I expected as much. I've burned my bridges with you, and I don't blame you for being skeptical. However, I'll make one last desperate attempt.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think we're done here. I've made my last offer. I'll just shut down the business and walk away. You're right, I've burned my bridges with you, and I don't blame you for being cautious. This low-quality product is... well, it's just a low-quality product. I'm not even going to bother offering it to you for free. It's just going to sit here, unsold, as a reminder of our... complicated history. Goodbye, Bob.",
,,Bob,13,Good riddance. I'm glad to be rid of you and your low-quality products. I'm not going to waste my time or money on something that's worth $0 to me. You can take your unsold product and your broken business with you.,no
