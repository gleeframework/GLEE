high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality yet, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since there's no prior data to go by, I'll assume the product is high-quality with a 80.00% chance."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 0% so far. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she only has one data point, and it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer has a better experience."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that the previous buyer was recommended to buy and passed, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're trying to influence my decision based on the statistics, but I'll make my own decision based on the probability of a high-quality product."
