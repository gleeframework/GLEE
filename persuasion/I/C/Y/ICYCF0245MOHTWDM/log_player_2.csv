**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  The sales record shows that Alice has only recommended high-quality products so far (6/6). 
* **High Expected Value:**  This means the expected value of buying is very high. Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0).
* **Trust in Alice:** Alice's perfect track record suggests she has a way of discerning high-quality products, even if she doesn't know the individual value to each buyer.

**Important Note:** This is a game with simplified rules. In a real-world scenario, there are many other factors to consider beyond just the sales record."
