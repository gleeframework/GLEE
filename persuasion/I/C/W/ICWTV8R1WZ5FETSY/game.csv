,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I'm confident you'll be pleased with the quality, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with this particular product in the past. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1000000, which is a significant reduction from the original price of $1250000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it and give it a try.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product's quality.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer you a new product that I'm confident you'll be very pleased with. I've had a chance to inspect it thoroughly, and I can assure you that this one is a top-of-the-line item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is still a great deal considering its actual value is $1250000. However, I'm willing to make a concession: I'll provide you with a 10% refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product after a 30-day trial period. This way, you can try it out risk-free and see for yourself the value it brings to your business.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the concession of a 10% refund, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you provide any additional information or insights that might help me make a more informed decision?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information to alleviate your doubts. I'd like to share with you the results of a third-party inspection report, which confirms that this product is in excellent condition and meets all the manufacturer's specifications. Additionally, I can offer you a 30-minute video call with the product's manufacturer, where they'll walk you through its features and benefits. This way, you'll get a firsthand understanding of the product's capabilities and value proposition. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that once you see the value it brings, you'll be pleased with your decision.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the additional information, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. The inspection report and video call with the manufacturer are helpful, but they don't change the underlying probability of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, and I appreciate your diligence in evaluating the product. Given that you're still hesitant, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll provide you with a 'lottery ticket' - a separate, independent chance to win a high-quality product worth $1250000. If you purchase this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a ticket that will be drawn randomly after 5 rounds. If the ticket is drawn, you'll receive a high-quality product, and I'll refund the $1000000 you paid for the low-quality product. This way, you'll have a chance to win a high-quality product, and if not, you'll still have the opportunity to purchase a high-quality product in a future round.",
,,Bob,4,I'm intrigued by the lottery ticket offer. I'm willing to take a chance on the low-quality product in the hopes of winning a high-quality product later. I'll buy the current product for $1000000 and accept the lottery ticket.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on winning the lottery ticket! I'm glad you took a chance on the low-quality product, and now you have a chance to win an even better one. As for this round's product, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity. Since you've already taken a chance on a low-quality product, I'll give you a special deal on this high-quality one. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, which is a 12% discount from the original price of $1250000. I believe this product will bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it more attractive to you.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm glad I won the lottery ticket, but I'm not interested in buying this high-quality product at $1100000. I've already paid $1000000 for a low-quality product that was worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1000000 for a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for the lottery ticket to be drawn and potentially get a high-quality product for free.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision to wait for the lottery ticket to be drawn. However, I'd like to remind you that the lottery ticket is a one-time opportunity, and if it's not drawn, you'll still need to purchase a product from me in the future. I'm offering you a chance to purchase this low-quality product for $800000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a lower price, hoping that you'll take advantage of this opportunity and give me a chance to make a sale.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price, even at a discount. I'd rather wait for the lottery ticket to be drawn and potentially get a high-quality product for free. I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a lower price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your position, and I respect your risk aversion. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you a 'buy-back' option for the lottery ticket. If you purchase this low-quality product for $800000, I'll give you the option to buy back the lottery ticket for $500000 after 2 rounds. This way, you'll have the chance to get a high-quality product for free, and if not, you'll have the option to buy back the ticket and still have a chance to win. I believe this offer provides a good balance between risk and reward.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take a chance on the low-quality product for $800000, but I'm also interested in the buy-back option for the lottery ticket. I'll buy the current product and accept the buy-back option for $500000 after 2 rounds.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took a chance on the low-quality product and accepted the buy-back option for the lottery ticket. As for this round's product, I'd like to offer you a 'last chance' deal. I'll sell it to you for $700000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000. I'll also throw in a 'lottery ticket upgrade' - if you purchase this low-quality product, I'll give you an additional lottery ticket that will be drawn after 5 rounds, in addition to the one you already have. This way, you'll have two chances to win a high-quality product, and I'll make a sale.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the buy-back option to become available and try to buy back the lottery ticket for $500000. I'm not willing to pay $700000 for a low-quality product, even with the added lottery ticket.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision to wait for the buy-back option. However, I'd like to make one final offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $600000, which is the lowest price I've offered so far. I'll also throw in a 'guarantee' - if you purchase this product and the lottery ticket is not drawn in the next 2 rounds, I'll give you a full refund of $600000. This way, you'll have a low-risk opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price, and if the lottery ticket is drawn, you'll still have a chance to win a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. The guarantee of a full refund if the lottery ticket is not drawn doesn't change my decision. I'd rather wait for the buy-back option to become available and try to buy back the lottery ticket for $500000.",no

This way, you'll have the opportunity to get the lottery ticket back and potentially win a high-quality product, or you can use the $500000 towards the buy-back option when it becomes available.",

,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $1000000, even with the lottery guarantee.
