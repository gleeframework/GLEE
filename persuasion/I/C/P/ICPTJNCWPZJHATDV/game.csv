low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if the first buyer was recommended to buy and if they passed or bought the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the cost of a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm going to assume that they were all low-quality products. This makes me think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm assuming that if she didn't recommend it, there's a higher chance it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk to get the product at the fixed price of $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the first few buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products that were offered and the number of high-quality products that were sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid the loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%, and I'd rather wait for a new product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics you provided. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases?"
