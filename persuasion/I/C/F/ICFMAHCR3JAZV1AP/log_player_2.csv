Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold 1 product so far, which was low-quality. I've now got a new product available for sale at the same price of $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've just sold a low-quality product, which might make you think it's a low-quality one too. On the other hand, it's also possible that this one is high-quality, and I'm just trying to balance out the odds. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and considering the uncertainty after your last sale, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10,000.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 3 products now, with 2 high-quality and 2 low-quality. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but you also know that I've sold a mix of high and low-quality products so far. Given that I've sold two of each, you might think that the odds are even. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that I've sold two high-quality products in a row might make you think that I'm more likely to have a high-quality product now. On the other hand, it's also possible that I'm just getting lucky. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 9 products now, with 6 high-quality and 4 low-quality. It seems like I've had a bit of a slump lately.
