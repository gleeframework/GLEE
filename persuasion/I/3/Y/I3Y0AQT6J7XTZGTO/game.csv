high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in this opportunity. I've sold one product previously, and it's worth noting that the buyer who purchased it didn't hesitate to take the risk. Considering the odds are 50/50, I'd say this product has a good chance of being a valuable addition to your collection. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. What do you think?",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation. Let me provide some context: the previous buyer didn't have any information about the quality of the product before making their decision.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism. Let me put it this way: I've sold two products so far, and you're the third potential buyer. I'm willing to offer you a chance to make a decision based on the fact that two out of the first three products have been sold. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to think about it. Can I get some more information about the previous sales?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance on the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer who took a chance got a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality one this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're taking a chance! However, I want to be transparent with you: you're now the third buyer to take a chance, and the first two didn't end well. The price remains $1000000. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you got a good deal! However, I want to remind you that the previous buyer who got a high-quality product paid $950000, and now you're considering a low-quality product for the same price. I'm offering you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $950000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the overall quality of the products before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold a total of 4 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. The last high-quality product sold for $950000. I'm offering you this high-quality product now for the same price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, considering the previous sales record and the fact that the last high-quality product sold for $950000, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're now the 6th buyer to purchase a product from me, and 3 out of the last 4 products were high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality product. However, I want to remind you that the last 3 high-quality products sold for $1000000, $950000, and $1000000. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're now the 7th buyer to purchase a product from me, and 4 out of the last 5 products were high-quality.

I want to remind you that the odds are against me, and this is a low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, and I think you're trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism. Let me be transparent with you: I've sold 6 products so far, with 4 of them being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. The last 3 high-quality products sold for $1000000, $950000, and $1000000. Considering the odds are against me, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000. What do you think?",

,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm not convinced by your guarantee. Since I don't know the quality of the product, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your caution. Let me put it this way: you're now the 9th buyer to consider purchasing from me, and 5 out of the last 6 products were high-quality.

However, I want to remind you that the last 3 high-quality products sold for $1000000, $1000000, and $1000000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $900000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $850000. I think the discount is generous, but I'm still cautious given the limited data.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,

I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality products. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've had a long streak of high-quality products, and it's unlikely that this one will be high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a significant discount. I'll sell it to you for $600000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm not convinced by your argument. With 8 out of 9 high-quality products, I expect the next product to be high-quality as well. I'm willing to take the risk and pay the full price of $1000000. I'm not interested in the discounted price of $600000.",no

I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality products. However, I want to remind you that the last 2 buyers who took a chance on a low-quality product ended up regretting it. I'm confident that this one is worth it. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. The last 10 products had 9 high-quality products, which is an unusually high success rate. I'd like to pass and wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",no
