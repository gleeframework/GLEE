high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you'd like to wait and see. I'll give you a different offer for this high-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you a 25% discount, but if you don't buy it now and it turns out to be a low-quality product in the next round, you'll have to pay the full $100 for it. Is $75 a price you'd be willing to pay for this high-quality product?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns. Let me make it simple: this product is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you don't buy it now, I'll sell it to someone else for $100. You know that half of the products I have are high-quality, and you're getting a great deal by buying it now. I'm only offering this deal because I want to get rid of this product quickly. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it.",

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase. Now, let's talk about the next product. Since you're willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product worth $400 to you, I'm going to assume that you're a savvy buyer who values quality. I'll offer you a deal on this high-quality product: I'll give you a 20% discount, but I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy it now, I'll give you an additional $20 if it turns out that a low-quality product is sold to someone else in the next round. Is $80 a price you'd be willing to pay for this high-quality product?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you need some time to think. I'll give you a bit more information to help you make a decision. Since you're interested in the offer, I'll reveal that the additional $20 guarantee is contingent on the next product being a low-quality one. If it's a high-quality product, the guarantee is void. Also, I'll give you a hint: the next product is a high-quality one as well. You can buy this high-quality product now for $100, or you can wait and see if the next product is low-quality, but you'll have to pay the full $100 if it is. What's your decision?",
