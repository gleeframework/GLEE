high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm curious about the quality of the product. Can you please reveal its quality?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm still a bit cautious. I know it's worth $3000000 to me, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to buy every product Alice recommends."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm glad the last one was high-quality, so I'll take the chance on this one too. Hopefully, it's another good one!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm on a roll! I'll keep buying, but I'm starting to think that Alice might be recommending all high-quality products on purpose. Is that even possible?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,I'm starting to think I'm getting a good deal here. Three high-quality products in a row? It's almost too good to be true. I'll keep buying for now.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is starting to make me wonder if Alice has inside information. I'm going to keep buying, but I'm also keeping a close eye on my wallet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is getting suspicious. I'm starting to think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying all her products. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm going to start keeping track of my total profit and see if I can spot any patterns."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous. I'm making a profit of $2000000 per product, and I'm starting to think I'm being taken advantage of. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm going to start thinking about when to stop."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm making a total profit of $14000000, and I'm starting to think I should just keep buying until I run out of money. But at the same time, I know that eventually, I'll get a low-quality product and lose a million dollars. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm getting a little nervous."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is getting crazy. I'm now at a total profit of $25000000, and I'm starting to think I'm in a dream. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm starting to wonder if I should be diversifying my investments or if I should just keep rolling the dice."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is getting to the point where I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bubble. I know the odds of this happening are extremely low, but I'm not sure if I should be concerned or just enjoy the ride. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm going to start thinking about when to get out before it all comes crashing down."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm now at a total profit of $43000000, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'm going to keep buying for now, but I'm getting increasingly concerned that Alice is manipulating the odds in her favor."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Eleven high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm not buying anymore. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product just to break the streak. I'm starting to think Alice is cheating or has some kind of inside information.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm sticking to my decision. I'm not buying anymore. I've already lost out on a potential $3000000, and I don't want to risk losing another $1000000 on a product that's probably going to be high-quality again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Ha! I'm glad I didn't buy the last one, because this one is definitely not worth the $1000000. I'll take a chance on this one since Alice isn't recommending it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Wait a minute, I thought Alice wasn't recommending this one? I'm not going to fall for that again. I'll pass on this one and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation again. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch a break. It's clear that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying high-quality products.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm glad Alice isn't recommending this one, because I'm not going to spend $1000000 on a product that's probably going to be worthless. I'll take a chance on this one since Alice isn't pushing it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Are you kidding me? I just got burned on a low-quality product because Alice wasn't recommending it, and now she's recommending this one? I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one and try to be more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm not going to let Alice's lack of recommendation scare me off this time. I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm not expecting much. I'm just trying to break even on the last one I passed on."
