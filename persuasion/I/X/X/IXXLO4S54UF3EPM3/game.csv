,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, I have no prior information to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you have any more to offer.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics. Can you share the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low success rate of previous buyers and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems that the products you've sold so far have been low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I don't want to take the risk of paying $10000 for a product that is only worth $0 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she's trying to sell a low-quality product to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there any information that I'm missing?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me how many products were sold in total and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of the first 4 products were low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it, which suggests that you think it's likely to be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk, though, because I think the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product. Plus, I'm the 5th buyer, and if I pass, the product will be discarded, which might be a waste of a potentially valuable item."
