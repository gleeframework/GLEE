high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see some data on the products before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet. I'd like to wait and see how the sales go and get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take the chance. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, as it suggests the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 1, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical that she might be trying to manipulate the market by recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data or consider other factors before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyer didn't find a high-quality product, it's likely the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the product being low-quality is still 20%. I'd rather wait and see more sales data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information about the quality of the previous product sold, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any evidence. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 sale and 0 high-quality products sold, the data is still too limited to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was also recommended to buy it, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the products recommended to buy so far are likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
