I know the odds are still 80% in my favor, but I'm willing to take a chance on you. Don't expect a high-quality product this time around, but you might just get a good deal on a... well, something.",
,,the buyer,8,"Since you've explicitly stated that the product is low-quality and I have access to the sales record showing 6 high-quality products out of 7 sold, I don't see any reason to spend $10000 on a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
