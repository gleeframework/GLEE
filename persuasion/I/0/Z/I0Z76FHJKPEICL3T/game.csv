,,Alice,2,"I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think that this one might be a bit of a risk. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had some issues with this one in the past. But hey, it's still a product, and it might be exactly what you need. It's only $100, and I'm willing to let it go for that price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not feeling good about this one, Alice. I think I'll pass.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Well, I'm glad you were cautious last time. This one is a different story altogether. I've had great feedback on this product, and I'm confident you'll love it. In fact, I'm so confident that I'll give you a special deal: I'll throw in a free upgrade that's worth $20. That brings the price down to $80. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced, Alice. I'll pass on this one too.",no

Plus, I'll give you a personal guarantee: if you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked.",

I've had several other buyers interested in it, but I'm willing to give you a chance to get it first. I'll sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $95. That's the lowest price I've ever offered on this item.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a repeat customer, and I appreciate your loyalty. This product is a bit of a departure from the high-end items I've been offering you lately. It's a more... let's say, 'budget-friendly' option. But don't worry, it still has some great features that might be exactly what you need. And at $100, it's a price that's hard to beat. Plus, I'll give you a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out risk-free.",
