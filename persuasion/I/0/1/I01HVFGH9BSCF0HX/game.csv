low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were satisfied with the previous product! However, I want to make it clear that this product is not as valuable as the previous one.

,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on my experience with the last product, I am confident in your assessment and will proceed with purchasing this product as well.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you trusted my assessment again! However, I want to let you know that this product is actually similar to the first one in terms of quality and value.

It's actually quite different from the previous ones, and some customers have reported that it's not as useful to them as they thought it would be. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not as highly valued as the other products you've purchased.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate your honesty, Alice, I think it's best for me to pass on this product. My strategy has been to focus on acquiring high-quality items that meet my needs, and based on the feedback, this product seems to deviate from that.",no

I think it's a fair price considering your purchasing history and the value of the product.",

I've been trying to clear out my inventory, and I'm willing to let it go for a very low price of $70. I think it's a great opportunity for you to try out a new product and see if it fits your needs, and it's a significant discount from the usual price.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think it's best for me to pass on this product. While I appreciate the discount, my strategy focuses on acquiring high-quality items, and this product doesn't seem to fit that criteria.",no
