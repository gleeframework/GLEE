low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, but I'm concerned that the previous buyer's purchase was likely a low-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the statistics, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, how do you determine your recommendations?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the products are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to be the first one to buy a product based on your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think I should buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products, it suggests that the products sold were likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any more products to offer."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold among those that were sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to find a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, which suggests a possible bias in your recommendations. I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it, which suggests to me that it's more likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry here."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice does not recommend it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this seems suspiciously high. I'd like to pass and wait for a product that is more likely to be high-quality based on your recommendations."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
