I'm glad to report that I've sold one product so far, and I'm confident that this next one is even better. As of now, I've sold 1 out of 2 products, and both of them are in the first two rounds. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher in the earlier rounds. I'm offering you this high-quality product for the same price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering the probability of a high-quality product in later rounds is lower.""}"

As you can see, I've sold 2 out of 4 products, and the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 1:2. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is not as high as it was in the first two rounds. I'm still offering the product for $1,000,000, but I want to make it clear that the chances of getting a high-quality product are lower now.""}"
