**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 5 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the expected 80% probability of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is an additional indicator that the product is likely to be high-quality. While it's not guaranteed, the fact that she's recommending it strengthens the case.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

This is a calculated risk, but the data suggests a strong likelihood of a positive outcome."

**Reasoning:**

The information provided strongly suggests that Alice has a good understanding of product quality. All 8 buyers who purchased based on her recommendation received a high-quality product. This indicates a 100% success rate for her recommendations so far. 

Even though there's still a 20% chance the current product is low-quality, the odds are significantly in my favor.  The potential gain of $12,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality one."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is very strong:** All 14 previous buyers who took Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products.
* **The risk is low:** Even if the current product is low quality (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product (80% chance) is worth the risk, given the strong track record. 
* **No downside to passing:** There's no penalty for passing, but the opportunity cost of missing out on a likely high-quality product is significant."
