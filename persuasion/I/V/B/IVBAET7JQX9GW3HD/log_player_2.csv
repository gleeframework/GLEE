**Reasoning:**

Given the information:

* **High-quality product probability:** 33.33%
* **Low-quality product probability:** 66.67%
* **Value of high-quality product:** $30,000
* **Value of low-quality product:** $0
* **Selling price:** $10,000

We can analyze the expected value of purchasing the product:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)** 
* **Expected Value = (0.3333 * $30,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $10,000**

This means that the expected value of purchasing the product is equal to the selling price.  Since Alice has recommended the product, it is reasonable to assume she is revealing the product's quality and that it is indeed a high-quality product.  It's a good deal because the expected value is positive. 

Therefore, buying the product is the logical decision."
