,,Alice,2,"I know what you're thinking, 'What's the catch?' But I assure you, this product is still a valuable addition to your collection. It may not be the best, but it's a good starting point. Think of it as a stepping stone to a more premium product in the future. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a free accessory that complements this product perfectly. It's a $500 value, absolutely free. Is it worth considering?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing the product's quality. The free accessory is a nice bonus, but it's not enough to justify the purchase of a potentially low-quality product.",no

But, I will say that it's still a useful tool, and it might find a place in your workflow. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's a fair price, considering its limitations. What do you say?",
