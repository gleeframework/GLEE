high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the 50% chance of a high-quality product, so I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that you recommended against it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product.
