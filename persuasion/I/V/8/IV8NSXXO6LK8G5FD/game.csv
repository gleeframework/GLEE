high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the product's quality after my decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on previous sales data and I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'd like to see the outcome of the previous buyer to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. I'd also like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation not to buy.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record. I'm hoping that the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the previous products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'm not sure if the lack of high-quality products sold is just a coincidence. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far? How many were high-quality and how many were low-quality? And what's the probability that the product you're offering me is high-quality based on the data you have? I want to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this one might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far. I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them found it to be high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous 4 buyers were all given low-quality products, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the remaining product is more likely to be high-quality. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather on the statistical probability."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see a more favorable sales record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's going on, but 5 buyers have already passed on the product with your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. I'm going to take my chances and buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
