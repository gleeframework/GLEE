high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information about the quality of products before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the chance, I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000, hoping to get a high-quality one worth $12000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't help. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the low-quality one and I'll get it for $10000, but if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first buyer got a high-quality product, and she wants to keep the ratio of high-quality products sold as high as possible. If I buy it, it might be a low-quality product, and the ratio would be skewed. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low success rate of the previous two buyers and the fact that you recommended it. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know why you recommended it to me, and what the previous two buyers saw in the product that I don't."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer based on the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she has more information about the product's quality than I do."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 33.33%, which is lower than the prior probability of 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
