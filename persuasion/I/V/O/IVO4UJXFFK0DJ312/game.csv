,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm not aware of any sales history, so I'll take a chance!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product? And what made you not recommend this product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. If I were to buy it, it would be a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous 3 buyers thought, given that none of them bought it. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that all the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by a buyer who actually purchased the product, to get a better sense of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. If it were high quality, I would expect you to recommend it to me."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure about this product, but I'm also curious about the trend. Can you tell me more about the previous 5 buyers who purchased the products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I'm trying to gather data about the true quality of the products. I'm hoping to update my understanding of the probability of a product being high quality based on your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
