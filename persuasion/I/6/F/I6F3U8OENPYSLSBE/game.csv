high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality. I'll take that risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go on."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 sold, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, I know that the true proportion of high-quality products is actually 80%, and I suspect that the first buyer got lucky. I'd like to wait for more data to confirm whether the product is indeed high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low quality of the previous product sold or because of the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
