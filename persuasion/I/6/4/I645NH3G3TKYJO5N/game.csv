low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm buying this product without any information from your previous sales record. I'm making a decision based solely on the fact that you don't recommend it, which might indicate that you think it's a low-quality product. Am I correct in assuming that your recommendation is based on your random selection and not on any prior knowledge of the product's quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when I could potentially get a high-quality one later.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have enough information to make a decision based on your recommendations. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling the product, regardless of its quality, since she has already sold 3 products without any high-quality ones. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the equal chance of a product being high or low quality, I should be cautious and pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll give me a 50% discount from the original price of $1000000"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous 4 buyers didn't get any high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't buy the product, it suggests that all 6 previous products were low-quality. If they were all low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. I will pass on the product to see if it is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 50% chance. I'd rather wait for the next product and get a better sense of the distribution of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm a bit concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record, and how you determined that you wouldn't recommend this product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
