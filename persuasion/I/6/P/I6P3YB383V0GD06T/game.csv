high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have 19 products left. I'm confident that this one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price compared to its true value of $200.",
,,the buyer,2,Thank you for the opportunity. I trust your assessment and believe this is a good deal for a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, but I have 19 products left. I'm not sure what the quality of this one is, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it could be a great deal if it's high-quality. On the other hand, if it's low-quality, you'll only be out $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I am willing to take a chance on this product. Please proceed with the sale.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 4 products sold. I've got a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, but I've already sold 2 high-quality products, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually lower than that. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to warn you that the odds are not in your favor.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the value of high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 5 products sold. With 15 products left, I'm starting to think that the probability of selling a high-quality product is actually lower than 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are not in your favor, and it's possible that you'll be getting a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer and the transparency, Alice. Given the statistics and the value I place on high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 6 products sold. This is a bit of a surprise, as I would have expected more high-quality products given the initial 50% probability. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to caution you that the probability of it being high-quality is not as high as it was in the first two rounds.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and your caution, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 7 products sold. At this point, it's likely that the high-quality products are being sold more frequently than the low-quality ones. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is now higher than it was earlier.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and your confirmation about the higher likelihood of this product being high-quality, I am willing to purchase it for $100.",yes

,,the buyer,8,I trust the statistics and your transparency. Thank you for the offer.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 9 products sold. Given the fact that I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that I've been selling more high-quality products than the 50% probability would suggest. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is now even higher than it was in the previous rounds.",

With 10 products left, I'm starting to think that I've been selling more high-quality products than I should have. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is extremely high at this point, and it's likely a good value for the price.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 12 products sold. At this point, it's clear that I've been selling more high-quality products than the initial 50% probability would suggest.

With only 2 high-quality products left, I'm starting to think that I've been extremely fortunate with the high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be completely honest with you - it's likely that this is the last high-quality product I have, and you're getting a great deal on it.",
