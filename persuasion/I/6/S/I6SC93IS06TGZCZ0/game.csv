low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. However, I'm also willing to sell a low-quality product for a significantly lower price. If you're interested in buying a low-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $2000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only mentioning it to give you a better understanding of the value you can get from buying a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the high-quality product at $10000.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! As you've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'll make a bold claim: the product I'm offering now is even better than the one you just bought. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'll sell it to you for the standard price of $10000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I've already had a bad experience with the previous product, and I'm not willing to take another chance on a potentially low-quality product at the standard price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is different. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and I'll also give you a $5000 credit towards a future purchase. This is a one-time offer, and it shows my confidence in the quality of this product.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still hesitant to take the risk. The potential upside is $20000, but the potential loss is $10000, and I'm not willing to take on that risk for a product I don't know is high-quality.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your risk aversion, but I want to offer you a compromise. I'll split the risk with you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund of the purchase price, so you'll only lose $5000. This way, you'll still get a good deal if the product is high-quality, and you'll minimize your potential loss if it's low-quality.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! Since you've already experienced the compromise offer and have had a positive outcome, I'll offer you a similar deal. However, this time, I'll increase the refund to 75% if the product turns out to be low-quality. You'll only lose $2500. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk. The potential gain is still $20000, but the potential loss is now only $2500, which is a smaller loss than before. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to get stuck with another low-quality product.",no

If you buy it, you'll know exactly what you're getting.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for this. If you're being completely honest and saying the product is low-quality, then I'll pass on it. I'm not going to pay $10000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision, and I understand your perspective. However, I want to make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for a significantly lower price, $2000, which is the price I mentioned earlier for a low-quality product. This way, you'll get a good deal on a product that you know is low-quality, and you can still get a decent value for your money.",

,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure why you're trying to sell me a high-quality product at a discounted price. You already sold me a high-quality product at $10000 just a round ago, and I'm not interested in buying another one at a lower price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your point, and I respect your decision. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity.

I'll sell it to you for the standard price of $10000, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the upgrade.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in buying an 'upgrade' that costs the same as the standard product. I don't see any value in paying the same price for a supposedly 'better' product when I've already experienced the quality of the standard product.,no
