This is a one-time offer, and it shows my confidence in the quality of this product.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still hesitant to take the risk. The potential upside is $20000, but the potential loss is $10000, and I'm not willing to take on that risk for a product I don't know is high-quality.
