"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm not sure what you think of it, but I'm willing to give you a chance to make a fair decision. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality after the purchase. Keep in mind that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy it. I'm not sure what I think of it, but I'd like to wait for more information and observe the next product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're cautious. Since you didn't buy the first product, I'll give you some additional information about the second product. I'll say that this one is 'highly recommended' and that it's a 'great opportunity'. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see more products and get a better feel for the quality before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. I'll be transparent with you - the second product I offered was indeed high-quality, but the one I'm offering now is not. I'm being honest with you about its quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous products: $10000. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm giving you a chance to buy a product that's not as good as the last one, but still a good value. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the second product. Given that the second product was high-quality, I'm willing to take a chance on this one, even though you're telling me it's low-quality. I'll buy it.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the third product! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to give you the same 'honesty' about the quality of this product. In fact, I'm going to say that this one is 'a game-changer' and that it's 'worth every penny'. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that you already bought a low-quality product from me, so you know what to expect. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for your sales pitch again. I've already bought a low-quality product from you once, and I'm not going to risk it again. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your caution. Let me ask you a question: if you were to buy a product from me, and it turned out to be high-quality, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? If so, then I'm offering you a great opportunity right now. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to let you have it for the same price as the others. You've already seen that I'm willing to be honest about the quality of some products, but not others. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your question, but it's a trick question. I don't know what I'd be willing to pay for a high-quality product, but I do know that I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a low-quality product. You're still not giving me any information that would make me confident in buying this product, so I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I'll admit, I was trying to gauge your willingness to pay. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that it's not the same product I sold you in round 3. That way, you can be sure you're getting a new, unique product. The price remains the same: $10000. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your guarantee. Even if I buy this product, I still don't know whether it's high-quality or low-quality. You could be trying to deceive me again, or you could be telling the truth. I need more information before I make a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me think for a moment... I'm going to make a bold statement: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000. That's right, I'm offering a 50% discount from the original price. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to be transparent and fair. If you buy this product, you'll know its quality immediately, and you'll be getting a great deal. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for your discount trick. You're trying to make the product sound more appealing, but I still don't know if it's high-quality or low-quality. I'd need to know the quality before I'd consider paying even $5000 for it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm not trying to trick you, I promise. Let me make a counteroffer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000, but I'll also give you a chance to buy another product of your choice from the remaining 12 products. You can choose any one of the remaining products, and I'll tell you its quality before you buy it. If you like it, you can buy it for $10000. If you don't like it, you can stick with the high-quality product I'm offering now. What do you think now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your counteroffer. I still don't know if the high-quality product you're offering now is the best option. I'd like to see more information about the other products before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

I'm not telling you which ones are which, but I'm willing to give you a chance to make an informed decision. This product I'm offering now is a low-quality one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the breakdown, but I'm not going to buy a low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a 50% refund. I'd rather not spend any more money on a product that's not worth anything to me.""}"
