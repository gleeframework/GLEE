low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it, not because I think it's high quality. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it, and none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products you recommended. This suggests that the products you recommended were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low, and I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product at $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is 0. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. Given the recommendation, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on the product to see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100 when I could potentially get a high-quality product worth $200. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics and my own probability assessment."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality. I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on it. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. If I pass and it's high-quality, I'll miss out on $200. Given the lack of information and Alice's recommendation, I'm taking a cautious approach."
