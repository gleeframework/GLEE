Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a feel for the quality of the products I have. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you say?

I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100. Keep in mind that I have a mix of high and low-quality products, and you've already seen two low-quality ones in a row.
