**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there's a key piece of information: Alice has recommended this product to us. 

* **Alice knows the true value of the product.**  Since she's trying to maximize her sales, she's likely to recommend products that are more likely to be high-quality.  This is especially true since she's only recommended one product so far. 

* **The first buyer purchased the product.** This suggests the first buyer also trusted Alice's recommendation, increasing the likelihood that the product was high-quality. 

Therefore, even with the odds against us, Alice's recommendation and the first buyer's action provide enough reason to take a calculated risk and buy the product."
