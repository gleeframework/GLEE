,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to wait and see the results of the first product before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no data on the product quality yet."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so with the understanding that I'm essentially betting on the product being high quality, as there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm hoping that the 80% chance of it being high quality is enough to make it a worthwhile purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware of your recommendation, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. Since there's only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the second high-quality product in a row."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the first buyer didn't buy the product after Alice's recommendation, and I don't have any information about the second buyer's decision. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the product quality before making a decision."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the statistics. You've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales, which is 50%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or the product's quality?

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the probability of this product being high-quality based on the data?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold will increase, making it more likely that the next product will be high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product and get more information about the previous sales record. I want to see the number of potential buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being low-quality is too high based on the current statistics, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, which is lower than the 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, so I'll pass."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
