Alice's message: I've sold 2 out of 2 high-quality products so far, which is a 100% success rate. This is highly unlikely to be due to chance, and it's possible that I've been selling only high-quality products so far. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had 3 total sales, and 2 of them have been high-quality. I'm selling this product for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and I've had a streak of good luck so far.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 out of 3 high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely to be due to chance. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, this is a 4:1 against streak. I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not trying to hide any information from you. However, I think it's worth noting that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a high-quality product should be around 80% even if I've had a streak of good luck.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not relying on your past streak to make my decision. However, since the expected value of buying the product is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000 + $1,250,000 * 0.8 = $1,000,000, and the product is worth $1,250,000 to me if it's high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it from you for $1,000,000.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 4 out of 4 high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely to be due to chance. I want to acknowledge that the buyer in the previous round correctly calculated the expected value and made an informed decision. However, I want to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the law of large numbers suggests that a streak of 4 in a row is not necessarily indicative of a higher probability. I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide any information from you, and you should make your decision based on the 80% probability of a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand your point about the law of large numbers and the probability of a high-quality product still being 80%. However, I also take into account that 3 out of 4 products sold so far have been high-quality, which is consistent with your claim of an 80% chance of a high-quality product. Given that the expected value of a high-quality product is $1,250,000 and the price is $1,000,000, the expected value of buying the product is 0.8 * $1,250,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,000,000. This is equal to the price, so it's a neutral decision. But since you've explicitly stated that the current product is high-quality, I will take your word for it and buy the product.""}"
