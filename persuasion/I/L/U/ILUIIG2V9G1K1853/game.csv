,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. Since you don't know my valuation, your recommendation is not informative. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy, but none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all 8 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality.
