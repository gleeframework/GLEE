If you buy it now, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20, so you'll essentially be getting the product for $50.

It's a risk-free opportunity to get two products at a significantly discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying two low-quality products, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next one and see what it is.""}"

Since you're eligible for the 'free upgrade' offer, I'll make it even sweeter: if you buy this product now, I'll give you the option to upgrade to a premium version of this product, which is worth $150, for the regular price of $100. You'll essentially be getting a $50 value for free. It's a great opportunity to get an even better product than you were expecting.

This high-quality product is one of my best ones, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. If you buy it now, I'll give you the option to upgrade to a premium version of this product, just like before, but I'll also throw in a third product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free. It's a unique opportunity to get three products for the price of two.

But if the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on this product, and you can walk away without losing any money.
