,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it, but only if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full $100. Do you want to take the risk and buy it for $80?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to pass on this offer. I'm not convinced it's worth taking the risk of paying full price for a potentially low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last round. Let me make it simpler. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. You'll only pay $100 if it's high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the risk. If it's low-quality, I'll get a full refund, so it's essentially a $0 risk for me. If it's high-quality, I'll pay $100, which is still a good deal for me.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Great decision last round! Now, I'll offer you a product that I'm quite confident is high-quality.

Would you like to take it for $100?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not convinced it's worth the full $100 to me. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

,,Alice,7,"You're a master negotiator! I'll try to sweeten the deal even more. If you buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $60 refund on top of the full refund. You'll essentially get $160 back, and you'll only pay $40. If it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for $100. But, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

You'll essentially get $250 back, and you'll only pay $0. But, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 30% discount on the next five products you buy, regardless of their quality. And, I'll throw in a free premium service that's worth at least $20. What do you say?",

However, I'm starting to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality than high-quality, given the generous refunds you're offering. I'll pass on this offer.",no
