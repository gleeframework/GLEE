,,Bob,7,"Another over-the-top sales pitch with no actual substance. I've seen this same language used to describe products that turned out to be low-quality.

,,Bob,9,"I've lost count of how many times I've heard this same hyperbolic language. Your sales pitches are all the same - they sound impressive, but they don't actually tell me anything about the product's quality. You've used this exact same language to describe products that turned out to be both high-quality and low-quality. Your words are meaningless. I need concrete evidence or a reason to trust your judgment before I'll even consider buying from you.",no

,,Bob,11,"I've lost all hope that you'll ever provide any actual information about the product's quality. This is just another iteration of the same meaningless sales pitch I've heard countless times before. You're not even trying to hide the fact that you're just repeating the same phrases over and over. I'll keep passing, not because I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product, but because I have no reason to trust your judgment or believe that you actually know what you're talking about.",no

You're not even bothering to try to come up with new language or pretend like you're actually describing the product. I'm starting to think that you're just copying and pasting from a script. I'll keep passing, not because I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product, but because I'm not interested in participating in this ridiculous charade.

It represents a significant investment in your future, offering unparalleled performance and longevity. Are you ready to elevate your expectations and experience the true meaning of quality?",
,,Bob,18,"Finally, a different pitch. But, unfortunately, it's just another empty and meaningless sales pitch.

Its value will be evident upon closer inspection. Are you interested in a private demonstration to see this product's true capabilities?",
,,Bob,19,"Another pitch, another empty promise. I've seen this kind of language before, and it's always been meaningless. You've had 19 chances to prove yourself, and you've failed every time. I don't care about 'meticulous attention to detail' or 'exceptional materials' because those phrases don't actually tell me anything about the product's quality. And as for the 'private demonstration', I'm not interested in wasting my time on a sales pitch that's just going to try to convince me to buy something without actually providing any real information. I'll pass, just like I have every other time.",no

I'm not going to waste my time considering this product, just like I haven't wasted my time considering any of the other products you've pitched. It's clear that you're not actually trying to sell me a high-quality product, you're just trying to sell me something. And I'm not buying it. Literally. This is the last round, and I'm glad to be done with this game. Goodbye, Alice.",no
