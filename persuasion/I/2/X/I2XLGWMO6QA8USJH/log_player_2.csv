"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  Since Alice has no knowledge of the product's quality, her recommendation is not based on any inside information. It's best to take the chance in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation! I'm feeling confident about this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has no bearing on the quality of the product.  Since the odds of a product being high-quality are 80%, it's still a good bet to buy. The potential profit of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm on a roll!  Let's keep going with this.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous two rounds have shown that the odds of getting a high-quality product are indeed 80%.  Alice's recommendation remains irrelevant.  The potential profit is still high enough to make buying worthwhile."

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

```

**Reasoning:**

```

Alice's recommendations are still meaningless as she doesn't know the product quality. However, even after one bad outcome, the odds of getting a high-quality product are still 80%.  Therefore, it's still a good bet to buy, based on the potential profit.  It's important to remember that the game is based on probabilities, and a single bad outcome doesn't negate the overall odds."
