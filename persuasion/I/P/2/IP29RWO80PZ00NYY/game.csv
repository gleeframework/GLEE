,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I have a 20% chance of having a high-quality product for the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product, please reveal whether it was indeed low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not surprised you passed on the previous one. This round's product is also low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll be honest with you, I've already had 1 low-quality product out of 2, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and a low-quality product is 20% for the next round.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product. Given the probability of a high-quality product in the next round is 80%, I'm waiting for that one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're waiting for the high-quality one! Unfortunately, this round's product is also low-quality. I'll give you a hint: if you were to buy this one, you'd be getting a great deal, considering the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. It's a 1 in 5 chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a steal compared to the $4000000 it's worth.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'm still waiting for the high-quality product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ah, finally! This round's product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I know you're aware of the value of high-quality products, and this one is worth $4000000 to you. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make a living too. I'll meet you halfway and offer it to you for $2500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the high-quality product for $2500000. I know it's a better deal than the market value, but I'm willing to pay a premium for the convenience of getting a high-quality product without having to wait and risk buying another low-quality one.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Great decision on the previous one! This round's product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $2000000. I know you're aware of the value of high-quality products, and this one is worth $4000000 to you. Considering you've already gotten a good deal on the previous one, I'm willing to offer you an even better price this time. I'll give you a 10% discount, so this one is priced at $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in the current offer. I already got a good deal on the previous high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $1800000 for a product that's worth $4000000 to me. I'd rather wait and see what the next round brings.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. This round's product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1800000, just like the previous one. However, I want to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you an additional $200000 in cash on top of the purchase price, making it a total of $2000000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product worth $4000000 to you, and you'll also get some extra cash. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the high-quality product for $1800000 plus the additional $200000 cash. That's a total of $2000000, which is still a good deal considering the product is worth $4000000 to me.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Great decision again! This round's product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $2000000. However, I want to let you know that I've had 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far, which means the probability of a high-quality product is now 50%. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher price for this one. I'll give you a 10% discount on the usual price, so this one is priced at $3600000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the current offer. The probability of a high-quality product is now 50%, and I'm not willing to pay $3600000 for a product that's worth $4000000 to me. I'd rather wait and see what the next round brings.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. This round's product is indeed low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% for the next round. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll be giving up the opportunity to potentially get a high-quality one for a good price. I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount on the next round's product if you decide to buy this one, so the price of the next high-quality product would be $3200000 instead of the usual $3600000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product. I'm not willing to give up the opportunity to get a high-quality product for a good price, especially when the probability is 50%. I'd rather wait and see what the next round brings, and I'm not interested in the discount on the next round's product as a trade-off.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. This round's product is indeed low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $800000. I'm willing to make a concession on the price because I want to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. If you buy this one, you'll be giving up the opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product for a good price, but you'll also be getting a great deal on this low-quality product. I'm not offering any discounts on future products, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in this one-time offer.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product, even at the discounted price of $800000. I'm not willing to pay anything for a product that's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that's worth $4000000 to me.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. This round's product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $3200000. I remember our previous conversation about the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $3000000, which is a 5% discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available later.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the high-quality product for $3000000. It's a good deal considering the product is worth $4000000 to me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the convenience of getting a high-quality product without having to wait and risk buying another low-quality one.",yes

However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is now 40%, and I'm willing to make a concession on the price.

I'm essentially giving it away. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, I just want to clear out the inventory.
