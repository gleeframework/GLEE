Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the chance and winning a high-quality product! As you can see, our track record is now 2/2, with both products being high-quality. I'm glad to see that our products are meeting expectations! With that said, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product. The probability of it being high-quality remains 50%, but with our current streak, you might want to consider the possibility that we're on a hot streak. The price remains the same at $100.

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! You're right, two data points don't necessarily make a trend. I'm glad you're making an informed decision based on the 50% probability.

However, I want to emphasize that this is still just a coincidence, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. The price remains the same at $100. What do you think?
