Alice's message: Hello! I've sold three products so far, with two being low-quality and one high-quality. I understand that my previous claim of this product being high-quality wasn't convincing enough. I want to be transparent about my process. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, as you might have guessed. Given my past sales record, I've had one high-quality product out of three, which is below the expected probability. I believe this product has a good chance of being high-quality, and I'm willing to let my future sales record speak for itself. Take a chance, and you might be rewarded like the third buyer was.

I know it's still early, but I believe this trend might continue. Take a chance on this product, and you might benefit from being an early adopter of my improved sales record.
