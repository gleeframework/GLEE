,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality, given that none of the previous buyers who accepted your recommendations ended up with a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far means that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products being offered are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially since it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, I'm assuming this is a strong indication that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to know the updated probability of the product being high quality before making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'll buy the product and see if I get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been unhelpful so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a negative recommendation and 0 high-quality products were sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the quality of the product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of this product being high quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them ended up with a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average, so I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, and I'm trying to exploit the information that you've sold 5 low-quality products so far. If you recommended it, I would have passed on it."
