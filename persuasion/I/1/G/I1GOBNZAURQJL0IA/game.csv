,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable product that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value. If you're interested, I can offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd like to wait for the next round to get a better understanding of the product's worth.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy this product at a discounted price of $900000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. However, I'll also provide you with a detailed report on the product's features and specifications, so you can make a more informed decision. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can decide whether it's worth the investment.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not willing to pay $900000 without knowing the product's quality. The report on features and specifications won't change the fact that I might end up with a worthless product. I'll wait for the next round to make a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me make you a deal. I'll give you a 'price lock' on this product. If you buy it now, I'll sell it to you for $900000, but if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $900000. If it's high-quality, you get to keep it for the agreed-upon price. This way, you have no risk, and you can still get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product with the price lock. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, I'll get my money back. This seems like a fair compromise.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! I'm glad you're happy with the product. Now, let's talk about the next one. I'll offer you a'split-decision' option. You can choose to buy this product for $800000, but with a twist: if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for the agreed-upon price. However, if it's low-quality, you'll have the option to return it and get a $200000 credit towards the next product. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a great price, or you'll get a credit towards a future purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure I like the split-decision option. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a credit, but I'll have to wait for the next round to use it. I'd rather make a decision now and get the product's quality revealed. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a 'certainty' option. If you buy this product now, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. If it's indeed high-quality, you'll get it for $800000. But, if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $800000. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make a confident decision.",

This way, you can try out the product and see its features firsthand, and you'll have nothing to lose. Who knows, you might find a use for it despite its low quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for that. If you're willing to sell it to me for $0, it's probably a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,7,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'll make you a deal. I'll sell you this product for $100. Yes, you heard that right, just $100. It's a steal, considering the product's features and specifications. I'm practically giving it away. What do you say?",
