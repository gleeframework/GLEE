Alice's message: I'm glad to report that the previous buyer has purchased the product and I'm confident they'll be satisfied with their decision. I have 11 products left to sell out of the initial 20. So far, I've had 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product that have been offered to buyers, and 1 low-quality product that was not purchased, as expected. The products are randomly selected from the initial pool, and I'm committed to presenting them to buyers in the order they are drawn. As for the expected value of the remaining 11 products, based on the current statistics, the probability of a product being high-quality is still around 80% in the long run. However, considering the current trend, it's possible that the actual probability might be higher. Assuming the 80% probability holds, the expected value of the remaining 11 products would be around $352000 (11 products * 0.8 * $40000). However, please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and the actual value may vary. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations.
