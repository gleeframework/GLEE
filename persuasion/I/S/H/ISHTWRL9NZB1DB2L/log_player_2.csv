**Explanation:**

The provided information suggests that Alice has a perfect track record: all the products she recommended were high quality.  While this could be a fluke, it's very likely she has some ability to discern high-quality products. Since a high-quality product is worth $120 to you and the price is $100, a purchase is a good bet, even with a 50% chance of being wrong."

**Explanation:**

* **The statistics are strongly in favor of the product being high quality.** 5 out of 5 purchases have resulted in high-quality products. This suggests a much higher probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation further reinforces this positive signal.**  While Alice doesn't know the individual value of each product to us, her recommendation is based on the information she has, which likely includes seeing that the product is of high quality.

Therefore, despite the inherent 50/50 chance, the available evidence strongly suggests the product is worth buying."
