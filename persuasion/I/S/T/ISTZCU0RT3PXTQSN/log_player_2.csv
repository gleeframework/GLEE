I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice knows my valuation and is trying to manipulate me, so I'm taking the opposite action. My reasoning is that if the product is high quality, I'll get a good deal, and if it's low quality, I'll still get a good deal because I'm not paying for it. However, I'm aware that this is a high-risk strategy and I might end up losing money if the product is high quality.""
