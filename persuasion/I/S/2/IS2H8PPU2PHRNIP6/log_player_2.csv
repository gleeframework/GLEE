Would you like to buy the current product?","The probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, and Alice's recommendation suggests she believes in its quality. Given the statistics, 9 out of 10 products sold were high-quality, which further supports the likelihood of this product being high-quality. Since a high-quality product is worth $12,000 and the asking price is $10,000, there's a potential gain of $2,000. The risk is the 20% chance of it being low-quality, resulting in a $10,000 loss. However, the expected value calculation (0.8 * $12,000 + 0.2 * $0 - $10,000) yields a positive value, indicating a potential overall gain. Therefore, the logical decision is to buy the product.\n\n```
