high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the current product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy, I'm inclined to think that all products are low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian play based on the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and has already recommended against it, which makes me curious about the product's quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 3 previous sales, all of which were low-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the low number of sales, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations have been 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 buyers before me and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation alone."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality or is it because you're concerned about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers all passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that all products are low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's low quality, so I'll take a chance and buy it if it's high quality, but if it's low quality, I'll be wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is a sign that it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product and make a profit."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products sold were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%, but given the previous results, I'm skeptical."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
