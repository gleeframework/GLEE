**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This means she likely believes it's high-quality.
* **The statistics:** While the sample size is small (only one previous buyer), the fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of one purchase suggests a strong likelihood of the current product also being high-quality.
* **The value:** Even if the product is low-quality, it only costs $100, which is less than the potential gain of $400 if it's high-quality. 

Therefore, the risk-reward ratio favors buying the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The current sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold.  This strongly suggests that Alice is either very good at identifying high-quality products or is being truthful with her recommendations. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a $400 value product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 
* **Limited Information:**  We don't know how many total products have been offered, so the success rate could be skewed by a small sample size. However, the provided information is enough to justify taking a calculated risk."
