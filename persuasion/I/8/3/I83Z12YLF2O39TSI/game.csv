,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get the first look at the quality of the product. I'll use this information to inform my decision for future products."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is high quality? I'd like to know more about the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't take into account my personal preferences and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality before making a decision. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to observe the quality of the product to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall proportion. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. Given the random nature of the products, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product. Can I see the statistics on the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm not convinced."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the current statistics. Since you've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 5, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 5, which is a relatively low proportion. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
