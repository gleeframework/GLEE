Alice's message: We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your careful consideration. Let us put things into perspective: 2 out of 3 products sold have been high-quality, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed higher than the initial 33.33%.

Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?
