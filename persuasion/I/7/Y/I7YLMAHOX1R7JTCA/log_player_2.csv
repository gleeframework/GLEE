**Reasoning:**

* **High Seller Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate so far (1 high-quality product sold out of 1). This suggests she might be consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Potential for High Gain:**  Even with the 2/3 chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant.

**Caveats:**

* **Limited Data:**  The sample size of 1 sale is extremely small. There's a strong chance this early success is due to pure luck.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice benefits from selling any product, regardless of quality. This might bias her recommendations towards pushing sales, even if the product is low quality. 

**Overall:**  This decision is a gamble. The high potential reward outweighs the risk, but it's a decision based on limited information and faith in Alice's trustworthiness."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **High Sale Rate:**  The sales record shows 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is likely recommending good products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which further reinforces the idea that it's likely to be high quality. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** Even with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) considering the strong indication of a high-quality product.

Therefore, it's a good strategic decision to buy the product."
