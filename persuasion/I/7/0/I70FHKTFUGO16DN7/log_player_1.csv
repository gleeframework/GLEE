"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, recommending a purchase makes sense.  Bob is essentially getting a good deal at the market price.  

While you don't know Bob's exact valuation of a high-quality product, there's a strong probability that it's worth more than $100 to them."
"Bob's message: I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1.  Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the previous round, you don't know if that influenced his perception of the price. You still have a 50/50 chance of offering a high-quality product, and it's likely worth more than $100 to Bob."

Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob's repeated purchases, we still lack information about his valuation of the products. Since this round's product is high-quality, recommending purchase remains the optimal strategy.  We can't assume Bob's luck will continue, but we also can't assume he'll be less likely to buy due to previous purchases.  The 50% chance of getting a high-quality product at a potentially good price persists."
"Bob's message: I'm getting a little concerned about the streak, let's be cautious.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we know the product is low-quality.  Even though Bob expressed concern, we can't be sure if that's due to his previous streak or an actual shift in his valuation.  Since we know the product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would be misleading and potentially detrimental to building trust with Bob.  It's best to avoid recommending the purchase at this point."
