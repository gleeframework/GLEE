"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The product in this round is high-quality, and Bob knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This means there's a high chance of the product being valuable to him.  Even though the price is high, the potential profit ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000) significantly outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product."
