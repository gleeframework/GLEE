**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the fact that Alice has recommended it gives you valuable information. She knows the quality of the product and is recommending it, suggesting it's likely to be high quality.
* **Positive previous result:**  The previous buyer purchasing the product and it being high quality increases the likelihood that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Potential reward outweighs risk:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in your best interest. However, there is no guarantee that Alice is being truthful or that the previous buyer's purchase was truly a high-quality product."
