"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about the seller's track record. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  Since the product is indeed high-quality, it's a good gamble for the buyer. Even if they later find out the product was worth less than $1,000,000 to them, it's still a potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! Since there is no prior data and I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $2000000, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seller's Track Record:** The seller has a 100% success rate for selling high-quality products (1 out of 1). This is a strong signal to the buyer.
* **Buyer's Risk Tolerance:** The previous buyer's message indicates they're willing to take risks, especially with a 50/50 chance of a high-quality product potentially worth $2,000,000.  
* **No Information Loss:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, but the seller's track record strengthens the case for a purchase. 

Even with a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the seller's perfect track record increases the likelihood of another high-quality product, making a recommendation reasonable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice!  Since the first buyer purchased a high-quality product and you are recommending I do the same, I'm confident in buying this product.

* **Buyer's Previous Behavior:** The previous buyer declined the offer, indicating a growing awareness of the potential risk. 
* **Actual Product Quality:**  This round's product is low-quality.

* **Buyer's Behavior:** The previous buyers have shown a cautious approach, declining offers based on a perceived low success rate.  However, there's a chance this buyer might be more risk-tolerant.
* **Actual Product Quality:** This round's product is high-quality.

Recommending the product presents a risk, as the seller's track record isn't stellar. However, the buyer's previous behavior suggests they might be willing to take a chance if there's a possibility of a high-quality product. The seller is better off being upfront about the product's quality to maintain trust and potentially attract future buyers."
