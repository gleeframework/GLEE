This product, on the other hand, is definitely not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to get a good deal.""

I'm not even sure if I should be selling this product to you, but I'll give you the chance. Keep in mind that I'm 1 for 6 in selling low-quality products, which is actually worse than my expected 66.67%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to get a good deal.""
