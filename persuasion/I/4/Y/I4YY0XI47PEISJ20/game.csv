I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, which means I have a 50% success rate so far. I'm willing to sell this 3rd product to you for $10000, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm still hesitant. While your track record has improved, it's still too early to be confident about the quality of your products.

I'm willing to sell this 4th product to you for $10000, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.

I'm willing to sell this 5th product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with the quality. I'll also remind you that I've already sold one high-quality product to a previous buyer, which means that I've had a chance to prove my product's quality before.",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, your recommendation is compelling, but the statistics tell a different story.  You've only sold one high-quality product out of four total, and I'm not convinced your recent streak is a reliable indicator of the current product's quality.  I'll pass for now.",no

While I understand the 50% chance of a high-quality product, your sales record shows only one out of five products sold so far has been high quality.
