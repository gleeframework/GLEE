low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen 3 other buyers pass on the products, and none of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%.
