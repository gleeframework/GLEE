**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from previous buyers, which is not enough to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Potential Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $400, while the price is only $100. Even if there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential upside is significant.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend products she believes are high quality. She wants to maximize sales and maintain a good reputation.

**Therefore, given the limited information and the potential for a high return, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice is reliably recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision to buy. While she could be wrong, the previous sales record suggests she has a good track record. 
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $400 if it's high quality outweighs the risk of losing $100."

**Explanation:**

* **Perfect track record:** The statistics show that all 8 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. 
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to provide accurate recommendations since she benefits from selling products.
* **High potential value:**  Even with the 50/50 chance, the potential value of a high-quality product ($400) is significantly higher than the cost ($100).

Therefore, given the perfect track record and the high potential value, it's a rational decision to buy the product."
