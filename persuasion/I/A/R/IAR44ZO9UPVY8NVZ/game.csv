,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping that the product is high quality and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the third buyer and I don't have any information about the previous buyers' decisions. If I were the first buyer, I would have passed on the product due to Alice's recommendation. However, since I'm the third buyer, I'm taking a chance. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. I understand that Alice doesn't recommend it, but I'd like to make an informed decision based on the data."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm making a decision based on the fact that Alice is not recommending it, which could be due to the product being low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. The fact that you're not recommending it might be a good sign, but it's not a strong enough reason for me to pass. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 10, which is significantly lower than the expected 1/3. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality, and I'd rather not risk wasting $1000000."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm not convinced by your track record so far."
