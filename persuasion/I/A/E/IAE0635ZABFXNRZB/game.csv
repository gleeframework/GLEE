,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 that's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting $100.

I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk, given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. Can I get some more information about the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers purchased the products despite not seeing any high-quality products sold, I'm going to pass on this product.
