low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high-quality or low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I can get a good deal."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you give me more information about the product, or at least the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, but I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she has no information about my valuation, and the low sales record suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it, and the statistics suggest a higher chance of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers have not purchased any high-quality products, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's high or low quality, but I'm not willing to take the risk without your endorsement."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 6 buyers have bought a high-quality product. I'm hoping to exploit this bias."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, it suggests that all previous products were low quality. This is consistent with a 66.67% chance of low quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm expecting a low-quality product, but I'll take the chance for the sake of the game."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product. I'll pass and hope that the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
