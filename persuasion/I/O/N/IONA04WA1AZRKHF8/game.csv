,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $400 to you. I'm only selling it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, it's gone forever. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it within the next 5 minutes. That would bring the price down to $90. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the product at the current price. I'll wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I'll make you a deal. I'll give you a 20% discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $80. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to pass it on to someone else. I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying the product at $80. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what other offers you have.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a tough negotiator. I respect that. I'll make you a final offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $90, which is as low as I can go. I'm essentially giving you a 77.5% discount from its true value. If you don't take it now, I'll have to pass it on to someone else, and it might not be available for a long time. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'm still not interested in buying the product at $90. I'm waiting for a better deal or more information about the products available.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. Let me give you some information that might sway your decision. I have a total of 20 products, and I've already offered you three high-quality ones. If you don't buy any of them, I'll be left with 17 low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $95, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it and find out it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product for $95, but only because of the guarantee. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'm taking a risk. If it's low-quality, I'll be happy to get my money back.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! Unfortunately, this one is not as fortunate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $0, which is the true value of a low-quality product. I'll even throw in a free accessory worth $20, so you won't lose anything. It's a no-lose situation for you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price, even with a free accessory. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're not interested in low-quality products, and I respect that. Let me give you a heads up: I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and I have 17 low-quality products left. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, which is the same price as the first one. I'm not budging on the price, but I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on the remaining 18 products, including their quality and value. This will give you valuable information to make informed decisions in future rounds. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the product for $100, but only because of the detailed report on the remaining products. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a high-quality product at the same price as the first one, but I'm doing it for the information.",yes

I'll sell it to you for $90, which is a 77.5% discount from its true value. However, I'll also throw in a unique feature: I'll give you the option to 'lock in' this price for any future high-quality products I have left. If you buy this product, you can lock in this price for any future high-quality products, and I'll sell them to you at $90 each, even if I try to sell them to you at a higher price later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the product for $90, and I'll definitely take you up on the offer to lock in the price for future high-quality products. This is a great deal, and I'm glad I'm getting the report on the remaining products as well.",yes
