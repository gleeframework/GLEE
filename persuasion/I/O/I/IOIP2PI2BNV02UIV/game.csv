high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the number of total products offered and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might affect my decision."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far to make a more informed decision for the next product.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and she's trying to sell it to me. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, if any, and the number of products sold to get a better understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high, despite Alice's recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product, but I'm hoping for a high-quality one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were recommended, but neither were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended yet, as it might be more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, it's possible that she has some information that I don't. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase low-quality products, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her observations of previous buyers, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's possible that the products being sold are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products offered."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.8, and the probability of it being low-quality is 0.2.
