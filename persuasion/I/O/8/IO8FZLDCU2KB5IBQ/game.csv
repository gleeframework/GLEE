low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm not sure what the quality is, and I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $12000 value."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the statistics, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice can reveal its quality after I've made the purchase. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase, regardless of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know why Alice recommended against it."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm a bit skeptical based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm hesitant to buy given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it. Can you explain your reasoning?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you suggesting that the product is low quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, I infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your previous recommendations have been consistent with a high proportion of low-quality products being sold, and I'm not confident that this one is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, all 5 previous buyers received a recommendation not to buy, and none of them bought the product. Given that there have been no high-quality products sold, it's likely that all products sold so far are low-quality. I'll pass on the current product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm a bit skeptical about the quality of the product given the previous sales record.

,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll wait for another opportunity."
