"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, it's still a gamble worth taking.  The potential payoff of $125 significantly outweighs the potential loss of $100.  It's better to take the chance early on and learn from the experience."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she doesn't know the value of the product to me, her recommendation is likely based on her own knowledge of the quality distribution. Her lack of recommendation suggests she believes it's more likely to be low quality.  Since the potential loss outweighs the potential gain in this case, I'll pass."

```

**Reasoning:**
