,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, making it $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you say?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concern, Bob. Let me make it simple: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to let you inspect the product for 5 minutes before making a decision. If you're not satisfied, you can return it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you say?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll take a different approach. I'll tell you that this product is indeed a high-quality product.

If you don't buy it now, you'll have to wait for the next round and take the risk of getting a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in buying the current product at $8000. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I get a high-quality product at the original price of $10000 or take the risk of getting a low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"As promised, the next product is revealed to be low-quality. I'll make you a special offer on this one.

I'm not sure how long this offer will last, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. I'll wait for the next round and hope it's a high-quality product.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,

The mystery prize is worth at least $1000, but I won't reveal what it is. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the mystery prize, and I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal.",no
