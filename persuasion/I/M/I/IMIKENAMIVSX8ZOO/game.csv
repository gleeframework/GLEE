,,Alice,1,"You have the chance to buy a high-quality product for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 1 product to sell. I'm willing to provide a money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the product.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information about its quality.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have a total of 1 product to sell. I'll give you a hint: the first product sold was high-quality, and I've kept the same product. If you buy this product, you'll be buying the same product that was just sold to the previous buyer. Is that worth the risk for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality again!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer! I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and I have a total of 1 product to sell. I'll make a bold claim: I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'm willing to offer a 50% discount if it's high-quality. But, if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund, and I'll also give you a $50 voucher for the next product. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, but I'm now offering this product at the same price of $100.

It's a risk, but it might be worth it...",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer, and I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I'll give you a more balanced view: the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 2/3. Considering this, I'm asking you to make an informed decision about this product. It's still $100, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, given that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 2/3, and considering the uncertainty, I'm willing to take the chance.",yes

I'm not making any promises, but I'll give you the chance to buy this product at the same price of $100. You can decide whether to take the risk or not.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With more low-quality products being sold than high-quality ones, and the last two being low-quality, I'm not feeling confident about this product. I'd rather wait for a better chance to buy a high-quality one.",no

,,Alice,13,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you a hint: the last product I sold was high-quality, and I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones overall.
