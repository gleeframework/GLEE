What do you say?",

,,Bob,4,"I'm starting to see a pattern where most of your products are indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to continue taking the chance. The addition of a 10% discount on my next purchase is a nice bonus, but it's not the main factor in my decision.

,,Bob,5,"I'm starting to trust your judgment, and the personalized guarantee you're offering is a nice touch. However, considering the 80% chance of the product being high-quality, I'm more focused on the potential value of $300. The refund and credit offer some insurance, but I'm willing to take the chance regardless. I'll buy the product and hope it meets my expectations.",yes

,,Bob,13,"I'll buy the standard product, but I'll pass on the collector's edition offer. While the exclusive design and potential value of $400 are enticing, I'm not convinced it's worth the additional $150. I'll stick with the standard product, which has a potential value of $300, and hope it continues to meet my expectations.",yes
