**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, suggesting it's likely high-quality. 
* **Sales record:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a very strong signal that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $200 gain outweighs the risk of a $0 loss, especially with the strong historical data."
