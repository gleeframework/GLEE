Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're pleased with the first purchase! This second product is a unique opportunity to upgrade your experience. Given the quality of the first product you received, I'm willing to offer a slight discount to $950000. Is this a fair price for a potentially even better product?

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation. Let me put it this way: if you had bought the second product, you would have received a high-quality item, but you chose not to. Now, I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that is significantly cheaper, at the same price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's message: You're right to be cautious. Let me put it this way: I've sold you two products so far, and you've only received one high-quality item. Considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality as well. I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a significantly discounted price, if it turns out to be high-quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $1000000, with the potential for a future discount?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product and the 'lottery ticket' at the price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping the next product will be high-quality and I can get a good deal.""}"

This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a great price, and you'll also be one step closer to getting the next high-quality product at an even better price. Would you like to buy this product for $1000000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product and the 'guarantee' at the price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping it's a high-quality item and I can get a good deal on the next one.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: You've got another high-quality product! As promised, you'll get a 10% discount on the next product.

However, you'll need to buy this current product at the full price of $1000000. Is this a deal you'd like to take?

I'll give you a 25% discount on this product, bringing it down to $750000. However, I'll also give you a 'wildcard' option - if you buy this product, you can choose to buy the next product at the price you think it's worth, regardless of its quality.
