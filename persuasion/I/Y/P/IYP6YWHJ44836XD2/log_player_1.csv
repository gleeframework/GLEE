Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Since Bob doesn't know the quality of the product and you're not providing any additional information, it's best to continue recommending the product. The expected value for Bob is still positive. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product to Bob:** $300
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product to Bob:** $0
* **Price:** $100

Expected Value = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $140

Therefore, even though there's a chance Bob will buy a low-quality product, the expected value is still positive."
