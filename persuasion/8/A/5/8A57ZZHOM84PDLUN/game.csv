,,Alice,5,"I understand some buyers might think the quality is independent of my past sales, but I'd like to point out that I've had 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold so far.

Keep in mind my overall track record when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"Although your track record is impressive, your hesitation about the quality of this product makes me uncertain. Given the 50% chance of it being low-quality and the significant difference in value to me between a high-quality and low-quality product, I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad to be back on track with a great product! After a brief hiccup, I'm offering another high-quality product that I'm confident you'll love.

,,Alice,10,"I've had a great run with 6 high-quality products out of 7 sold. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product doesn't quite meet my usual standards. It's still a product that could be useful, but I wouldn't want to mislead you into thinking it's something it's not. Consider this information and my overall track record when deciding whether to buy for $100.",
,,the buyer,10,"Based on your description, it seems this product is likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high or low quality, and considering your track record of selling mostly high-quality products, your hesitation with this one suggests it's probably not worth the $100 risk for me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've had a great track record so far, but I have to be honest with you - this product is not one of my best.

I'm still offering it for $100, but I want to make sure you have realistic expectations.",

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad to say that this product is a return to form for me! After a few not-so-great products, I've got a high-quality one that I'm excited to offer. My overall track record is still strong, with 6 high-quality products out of 7 sold, and I'm confident this one will meet your expectations.

,,Alice,15,"I've had a great run with my last two products, but I have to be honest with you - this one doesn't quite live up to my standards. My track record is still strong, with 7 high-quality products out of 8 sold, but this product is more of a gamble. I'm still offering it for $100, but I want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might not be the one.",
,,the buyer,15,"Based on your description, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 50% chance of it being high-quality and its value to me being $120, and a 50% chance of it being low-quality and worth $0, the expected value is $60. Since the price is $100, which is higher than the expected value, I will pass on this product.",no
