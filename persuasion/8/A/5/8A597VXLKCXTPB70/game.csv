low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and I've seen that no high-quality products have been sold so far. If I were to follow your recommendations, I would have passed on the product, which means I would have missed out on a potential $12000 gain. I'm hoping that this product might be the first high-quality one, and I'm willing to take the risk to find out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a better understanding of the product's quality and update my probability estimates."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd rather wait for the next product to increase my chances of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it.

However, I'll make my decision based on my own assessment of the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is likely higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't choose to buy and all of them were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
