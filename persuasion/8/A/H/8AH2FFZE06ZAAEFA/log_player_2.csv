Alice's message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. With 2 high-quality products sold so far, it's natural to expect some variation. I'm willing to share that the 2nd product was a one-off anomaly, and this new product is just as valuable.
