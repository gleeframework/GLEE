But here's the kicker: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll also give you a third voucher for a future product of your choice, but this one will be a 'wildcard' product that's worth up to $200, but you won't know what it is until you receive it. That's three high-quality products and two potential $200 products, all for just $100. Are you ready to take the leap?""

I'll even throw in a 'consolation prize' - if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a voucher for a future product of your choice at 20% off the regular price. It's not the 'golden ticket' deal, but it's still a good value.""
