,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you know my valuation and are recommending it, so I'll be cautious and assume it's low quality until proven otherwise."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'll take my chances."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the buyers, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have bought the products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the products they were recommended to buy were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low sales rate of high-quality products and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. If she's recommending against the product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there have been 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%, making the expected value of buying the product less than $100."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
