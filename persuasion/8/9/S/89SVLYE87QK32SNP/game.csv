high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product offered, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the 80% chance I was initially told. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,

I'd like to see if the pattern holds for the next product."
