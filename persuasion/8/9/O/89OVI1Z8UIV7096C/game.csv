low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a 50% discount on the price of $1000000. I'm aware that you don't know the value of the product to me, but based on the statistics, it seems like you're recommending against the product, which suggests it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like a discount to compensate for the uncertainty."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the products Alice has been offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to test the probability of the product being high-quality based on the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the low probability of a high-quality product being sold to previous buyers, not because of your recommendation."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and exploit the information asymmetry."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 previous buyers have bought the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 10 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
