"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is low-quality, and Alice doesn't know what Bob values low-quality products at, it's impossible to know if Bob would find the product valuable enough to justify the $10,000 price.  It's better to recommend Bob to not buy it."

```

**Reasoning:**
