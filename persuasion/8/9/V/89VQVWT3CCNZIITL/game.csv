,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the products Alice has are mostly low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's likely to be worth $0 to me."
