**Explanation:**

As an AI, I'm designed to be helpful and honest. Since the product is low-quality, it would be unethical to recommend the buyer purchase it, even though the buyer doesn't know the quality yet. 

The goal is to build trust with the buyer over the long term. Recommending a low-quality product would damage that trust."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous round ended with a low-quality product,  it's still beneficial to recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **Maintaining Consistency:** Recommending purchases consistently builds trust, even if the product turns out to be low-quality sometimes. 
* **Reputation:** While one bad product can hurt our reputation,  a history of consistently recommending high-quality products counteracts this.
* **The Odds:** The buyer is aware of the 80% probability of a high-quality product, and we've demonstrated a high success rate. This reinforces the buyer's trust and encourages continued participation.

It's important to be transparent and honest with the buyer, but also to continue building a positive relationship."
