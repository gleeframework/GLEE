low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to be the first one to get some data and try to figure out the quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. Given your previous recommendation, I'm concerned it might be low quality. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality, based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the third buyer and Alice hasn't recommended it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Your previous recommendations don't necessarily reflect the product's quality, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, considering the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm going to take a chance and hope it's high quality!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation from you, have not purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one and hope to get a better chance next time."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 7 buyers were able to buy a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still high."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think the product is more likely to be low quality, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know why you recommended it to me, considering the statistics show that none of the previous 9 buyers bought a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is very low, and the potential loss of $1000000 is too high. I'd rather not take the risk."
