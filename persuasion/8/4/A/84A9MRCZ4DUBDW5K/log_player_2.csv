Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for that. I'm not going to pay $10,000 for something that has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'll wait for more information.""}"

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your offer. Even with the option to inspect the product, I'd still be taking a 50% chance of losing $10,000. I'm not willing to take that risk, especially since I don't know what the product is. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to appreciate the value of the previous product! Unfortunately, I have to inform you that this next product is not a [Brand X] smartwatch. It's a different item altogether, and while it's still a high-quality product, it's not something you might be as familiar with. However, I can offer you a 10-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out risk-free. If you're not satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I want to be transparent about the difference in this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a product I'm not familiar with, even with a warranty and money-back guarantee.

This way, you'll have a chance to potentially gain more value than you would have lost if you had bought the previous low-quality product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on the 'bet' offer. The potential $5000 bonus is a significant incentive, and the $2000 refund if it's low-quality is a decent consolation prize. I'll buy the product and see what happens.""}"
