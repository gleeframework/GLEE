However, we want to caution you that our track record so far is 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which means we've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We appreciate your caution. We've sold 3 products in total, with 1 high-quality and 2 low-quality ones. It's clear that our initial product was an outlier, and our average quality is not yet where we'd like it to be. We're willing to offer you this product for $1000000, but we want to be upfront with you - our track record suggests that it's more likely to be low-quality than high-quality.",
