high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your skepticism! We're happy to provide more information about our products.

It's hard to put your finger on it, but you'll know it when you see it. And with only 2 out of 6 products sold so far, the chances are still in your favor. We're confident that you'll love it. And remember, the price is still the same - $100. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take a chance on this one, but I'd like to make an informed decision. Can you provide more information about the proportion of high-quality products sold in the past? I'd also like to know how many potential buyers there have been and how many products have been sold in total.",yes

But, let's be real, it's also possible that it's a dud. The price is still $100, and it's still a risk. But hey, what's life without a little excitement, right? What do you say? Will you take another chance?",
,,the buyer,5,I'll take a chance! I'm hoping the third high-quality product will be the charm.,yes

And at $100, it's a risk worth taking. What do you say? Will you take a chance?",
