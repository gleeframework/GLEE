"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm not sure if you know this, but I've been told that high-quality products are worth a significant amount more than low-quality ones. If you're interested in getting a good deal, I think you should consider purchasing this product.

Round 2
Alice's message: You made an excellent decision last round! I'm glad you're interested in another high-quality product. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling these products for a while now, and I can confidently say that this one is just as good as the last one. In fact, I'd say it's even better in some ways. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to get another great product for $100?

If you're interested in maximizing your chances of getting a high-quality product, I think you should consider taking this one.

I've had some issues with this batch, and I'm not sure if it's worth the full $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not as good as the others. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a special discount... no, just kidding! The price is still $100. But seriously, it's not as good as the others, and I think you should be aware of that.

Since you passed on the last one, I'm willing to give you a bit more information to help you make a decision.

I'm going to give you a bit of a heads up: I've noticed that you're getting a good streak going, and I'm starting to think that you might be able to tell when a product is high-quality. Am I right? If so, I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $90. Is that something you'd be interested in?

This product is another high-quality one, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to continue your winning streak.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the certification offer! However, I have to admit that I'm a bit concerned that I might have misspoken earlier. I don't actually have a way to verify the quality of the products, and I shouldn't have made that promise. As for this product, I want to be upfront with you - it's not as good as the others. I'd rather be honest with you than try to sell you something that's not worth the price. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for the next product, or would you like to take a chance on it for $100?
