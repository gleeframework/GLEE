,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one product sold and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the odds, not Alice's recommendation. I know that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/3 (since 2 out of 3 previous products were low-quality), and the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 2/3. Given the odds, I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially since I know its value to me is only $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'd like to wait for more information or a change in Alice's recommendation strategy before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it's more likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product worth $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it, as it suggests the product is likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000, which is still a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because of the lack of any positive recommendations from previous buyers. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I should be more optimistic and think that the product might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. If no one has bought a high-quality product yet, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, Alice. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?"
