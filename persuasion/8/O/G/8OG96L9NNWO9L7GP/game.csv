,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50. I'm aware that the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and I'd like to negotiate the price based on this uncertainty."

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not sure if the first buyer was lucky or if the product is actually high quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to get me to buy it, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low sales record and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the limited data so far. I'd like to see more sales and a clearer indication of the product quality before making a purchase.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%, but I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sale. What was the quality of the product sold to the first buyer?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This seems too high to be random chance. I suspect that the first product sold was high-quality and Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product."
