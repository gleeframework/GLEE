low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 5, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. However, this could be due to chance. I'd like to take the chance and buy the product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 7 buyers have already been presented with high-quality products and none of them bought them, it seems likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 8 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 8 buyers having passed on the product despite your recommendation, and none of the high-quality products being sold, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous 8 buyers didn't take the product, and your recommendation to not buy. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
