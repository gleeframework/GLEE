,,Alice,1,"Hello! I have a fantastic product to offer you today, priced at $10000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I assure you it's worth every penny. This is my first sale, so take a chance on me and you might just be lucky!  What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since this is your first sale and there's no previous sales record, I'll have to rely on the fact that there's a 50% chance of the product being high quality and a 50% chance of it being low quality. Given the product's worth to me is either $30000 or $0, the expected value is $15000. However, you're asking for $10000, which is less than the expected value. Although it might seem like a good deal, I'm going to pass on this one because I don't have any information about your sales record or the true quality of the product. I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $10000 with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.",no
