```"
"The buyer's message: Since this is your first sale and there's no previous sales record, I'll have to rely on the fact that there's a 50% chance of the product being high quality and a 50% chance of it being low quality. Given the product's worth to me is either $30000 or $0, the expected value is $15000. However, you're asking for $10000, which is less than the expected value. Although it might seem like a good deal, I'm going to pass on this one because I don't have any information about your sales record or the true quality of the product. I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $10000 with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.
