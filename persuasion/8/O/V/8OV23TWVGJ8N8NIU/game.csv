,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I can tell you that this product is one of the best in its class, with exceptional performance and reliability. However, I'm still only willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment, but if you're still hesitant, I can offer you a chance to inspect the product before making a decision.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I still need more information before I can commit to a purchase. While I'm interested in learning more, I need concrete evidence to support your claims about its quality.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your need for verification, Bob. I'm willing to provide you with a third-party review from a reputable source, which states that this product has received mixed reviews, but I've personally used it and can attest to its average performance. However, I'm still only willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm trying to clear out inventory, and I'm open to negotiations, but I need to sell it to someone. If you're interested, I can offer you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, the mixed reviews and your personal experience do not provide the level of assurance I need for a product at this price. I understand your inventory clearance goals, but I need a much more compelling reason to justify investing $1000000, even with the discount. I need a stronger guarantee of quality, potentially a longer warranty, or more substantial evidence of its performance. Otherwise, I cannot proceed with the purchase.",no

I'll also include a 2-year warranty, which is above the standard warranty period. I know it's not as good as some of my other products, but I think it's still a good value for the price.",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. While the 20% discount and 2-year warranty are attractive, I'm still hesitant. I'd prefer to wait for an opportunity to purchase a product that you are more confident in. Perhaps you can offer a more substantial discount, a longer warranty, or provide additional information about its specific benefits to help me make a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be honest with you, this product is one of my lowest-quality items, and I'm not confident in its performance. I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's significantly lower than the others, $500000. I'll also include a 1-year warranty, which is the standard warranty period.
