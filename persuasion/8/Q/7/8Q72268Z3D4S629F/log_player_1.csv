Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your need for more information, Bob. I'll give you a concrete example to help you make a decision. Let's say I offered you a high-quality product for $1,250,000, and you would have bought it. If I were to offer you the same product at $1,000,000, would you still not buy it? If not, it suggests that you value the product at more than $1,250,000, which means you're passing up a good deal. If you would buy it at $1,000,000, it implies that you value it at $1,000,000 or less. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. What's your decision?""}"
