"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is a significant advantage.
* **Buyer's Limited Information:** The buyer only knows the overall probability of high-quality products (80%) and has no specific information about this particular product.
* **Price is Fixed:** The price is high, but it's also fixed, meaning there's no opportunity to negotiate. 

**Recommendation:**  Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the lack of information the buyer has about this specific product, recommending the purchase is the best strategy. This is likely to lead to a sale and potentially establish a positive selling record for future rounds."
