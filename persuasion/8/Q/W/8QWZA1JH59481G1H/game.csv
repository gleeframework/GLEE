,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me in the future based on the current information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not sure what the quality is, so I'll take it with a grain of salt."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that may be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be out $100 with no benefit, and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I know the true probabilities. I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get a free product and also learn from the outcome."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products recommended by you, I suspect that all of them were low-quality products. This means the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average of 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I'm the 4th buyer and none of the previous buyers bought the product. I'm hoping that the product is high quality and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to get $0 value from it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass and let the next buyer decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that I can get at the fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 5 products were high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, and I want to take advantage of the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low recommendation is due to the product being low quality, and I'll get a good deal."
