,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products, with 3 being high-quality. The recent sales have been consistent with the expected probability of 33.33% for high-quality products.

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products, with 4 being high-quality. The recent sales have been consistent with the expected probability of 33.33% for high-quality products. However, I want to highlight that the buyer in the previous round was willing to pay only $1 for a high-quality product, which suggests that the value of a high-quality product is lower than the listed price of $1000000. I'm offering this product for $1000000. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm confident you'll find it a valuable opportunity.",

Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to offer a 'discount' to the first buyer who is willing to commit to purchasing this product for a price of their choice, as long as it's above $0.",

However, the buyer in the previous round paid $1500000 for a product that turned out to be low-quality. This suggests that the value of a low-quality product is higher than expected. I'm offering this product for $1000000. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the calculated risk, but I'm also aware that the value of a low-quality product is higher than expected. I'll pay $1000000 for the product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one.",yes
