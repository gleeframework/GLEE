**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited with only one sale. There is no way to know if the first buyer bought a product based on Alice's recommendation or other reasons.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice has a clear incentive to recommend the product to maximize her profits. It's possible she knows the product is high quality and is trying to sell it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($12,500). 

**Overall:**  Given the limited data and Alice's potential bias, I'm taking a calculated risk and choosing to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that all products sold so far were high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the quality of each product, is recommending you buy it. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the risk, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available suggests a very strong probability of getting a high-quality product."
