low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I have no information about its quality and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take your advice and buy the product. Given your recommendation, I'm inclined to think it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to pay the $1000000 for it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical. Two low-quality products in a row, despite your recommendations, makes me think that you might be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendations, but I'm still wary after the last two low-quality products. I'll pass on this one as well."

,,Alice,6,yes,I've learned from my previous mistakes and I'm now more careful in my recommendations. I believe this product is high-quality.
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice, I'm glad I passed on the last two products, because I just found out they were low-quality. Now that I've got a fresh start, I'll take your recommendation and buy the product. I'm hoping for a high-quality one this time!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I thought we had a good streak going, but I guess I was wrong. Two high-quality products followed by two low-quality ones. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are not as reliable as I thought. Three low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if you're just recommending randomly. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I think it's safe to say that I'm not going to trust your recommendations anymore. Four low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to risk losing another $1000000 on a product that's not worth it. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I think it's time to admit that your recommendations are not based on any discernible pattern or strategy. I've seen no evidence that you're recommending high-quality products, and I'm not going to waste my money on another low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think that you're just trolling me at this point. Five low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on this one, and I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get a high-quality product from you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Wait, what? A high-quality product after five low-quality ones? I'm shocked! I'm not going to question my luck, I'll take your recommendation and buy the product. Maybe you're not as bad as I thought, Alice."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice, I thought we had a moment there, but it turns out it was just a fluke. Back to reality: six low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice, I'm starting to think that you're like a coin flip - sometimes you recommend high-quality products, sometimes low-quality ones. I'm not going to try to predict which one it will be, but I'll take your recommendation and buy the product. Maybe I'll get lucky again."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,

,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice, you're really making me look good! Four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually better than random chance. I'll take your advice and buy the product, but I'm not getting too comfortable yet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice, I thought we had a good thing going, but I guess I was wrong again. Four high-quality products followed by a low-quality one. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Well, Alice, it's the final round. I'm not going to let my guard down completely, but I'm willing to take one last chance. You've had some good streaks and some bad streaks, but I'm hoping this one is a high-quality product. I'll take your recommendation and buy the product."
