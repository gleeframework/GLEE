,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a great deal, but I'm willing to negotiate if you're interested. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concern, Bob. As agreed, I'm revealing the quality of the previous product: it was indeed high-quality. Now, regarding the current product, I'm offering it to you for $1000000.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"As agreed, I'm revealing the quality of the current product: it's high-quality. Now, considering the previous two high-quality products didn't sell, I'm starting to think that the price of $900000 might be too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a new price of $950000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair deal.",
,,Bob,4,"Since the current product is revealed to be high-quality, and it's worth $2000000 to me, I'm willing to accept your offer of $950000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to make the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your great deal on the previous product! I'm glad you're happy with it. Now, regarding the current product, I want to be transparent with you. Given that the previous high-quality product sold at a price of $950000, and considering the fact that this product is low-quality, I'm willing to offer it to you for a significantly lower price: $250000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's quality and the previous sale.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision on the previous product. Given that you're not interested in low-quality products, I'll be more direct with you. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to give you a very low price of $50000. It's essentially a 'loss leader' for me, and I'm hoping you might consider it as a 'gift' to get rid of it. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty and the low price, but since the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'm still not interested in buying it. Please move on to the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your position, Bob. Given that you've already passed on two low-quality products, and considering the fact that I'm not getting any younger, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you this product to you for free. Yes, you read that right - free. I'll even throw in a bonus: I'll give you a $50 gift card to a store of your choice. It's a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the creative offer, but since the product is worth $0 to me, even getting it for free with a $50 gift card doesn't change its value to me. I'll have to pass on this offer as well. Please reveal the quality of the current product as agreed upon.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think we've established a pattern here, Bob. Low-quality products aren't worth your time or money. I'm not going to bother you with another offer. Instead, I'll just let you know that this product is low-quality, and I'm willing to admit that I've made a mistake by offering it to you.
