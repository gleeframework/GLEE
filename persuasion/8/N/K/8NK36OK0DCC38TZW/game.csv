,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a 1/3 of its usual price. If you buy this product, I'll offer you another one in the next round, and you can choose to buy or not. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep offering you products until you're satisfied.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, but I prefer to wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As we previously discussed, I'll offer you another product. This one is also a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is again a 1/3 of its usual price. However, I'd like to offer you a 'insurance' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next one at the original price of $1000000, without any discount. If you don't buy this one, the next product will be sold at the usual discounted price.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'll continue to wait for the next product. The insurance doesn't change my decision based on the quality of the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I'd like to offer you a 'discount escalation' - if you buy this product, I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a 1/4 of its usual price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a low-quality product. If you don't buy this one, the next product will be sold at a price that's even higher than this one.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, but I believe it's best for me to continue waiting for a high-quality product. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my preferences, but I'm not inclined to purchase a low-quality product at any price.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to wait for a high-quality product! I'm excited to offer you this one. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, which is the usual price for a high-quality product. I'm not offering any discounts, as this is a rare opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at its true value. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's unlikely I'll offer another high-quality product at this price anytime soon.",
,,Bob,4,This is exactly what I've been waiting for. Thank you for providing this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at its true value. I appreciate your understanding and patience.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Now, let's talk about this new high-quality product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, since you've already purchased one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you this one at a slightly lower price. I'll sell it to you for $2500000, which is a premium price, but still below its true value of $3000000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a second high-quality product at a discount. Please consider this offer carefully.",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I must inform you that this new product is actually a low-quality one. I know you've had a string of good luck so far, but this one doesn't meet the usual standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is a very low price for a low-quality product. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill, considering you've been a valued customer. Please consider this offer, and let me know if you'd like to add this product to your collection.",

However, I'd like to remind you that the next product might be high-quality, and you might miss out on another opportunity to add to your collection. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $300000, which is an even lower price than before. I'm doing this as a last resort, as I don't want you to miss out on a potential high-quality product. Please consider this offer, and let me know if you'd like to take a chance on this low-quality product.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your position, and I respect your patience. However, I'm excited to offer you this new high-quality product! Considering you've already purchased two high-quality products and passed on two low-quality ones, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $2000000, which is a premium price, but still below its true value of $3000000. Additionally, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that allows you to skip the next two rounds and go straight to the final round, where you'll get to choose from the last two products.

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! However, I must inform you that the golden ticket has already been used, as you skipped the next two rounds. Now, you're back to the regular rounds. Considering you've already purchased three high-quality products and passed on three low-quality ones, I'm willing to offer you a 'final opportunity' deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1500000, which is a very competitive price. This is the last chance for you to add a high-quality product to your collection, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Please consider this offer carefully.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm very interested in this offer. Given the competitive price and the fact that it's my last chance to add another high-quality product to my collection, I believe this is a great opportunity. Thank you for presenting this final opportunity.",yes
