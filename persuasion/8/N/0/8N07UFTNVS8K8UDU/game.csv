low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,You are the first buyer of the day. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?,
,,the buyer,1,I'll take a chance and buy the product for $100. I'm hoping it's high-quality!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance, I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's more likely that the next product is low-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,I'm skeptical about the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, but the next one is high-quality! I've sold a total of 3 products, 1 of which is high-quality. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, including the last one you can see. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but the streak suggests that I might have a higher proportion of high-quality products. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the chance, considering the streak of high-quality products, but I'll keep my expectations in check.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely given the 33.33% probability. It's possible that I've got a lucky streak going, or maybe the high-quality products are more common than expected. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance on this streak, I'll buy the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"The streak is over! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product in a row, but the last one is low-quality. Given the 33.33% probability, it's likely that I've returned to the average. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping the streak of high-quality products continues!,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"The streak is back! I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 33.33% probability. I'm starting to think that I might be selling a lot of high-quality products in a row, but I don't know how long it will last. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd love to take a chance! The streak is indeed impressive, and I'm willing to take a risk. I'll buy the product and hope it's another high-quality one!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"The streak is over, and I'm back to the average. I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products in a row, but the last one is low-quality. Given the 33.33% probability, it's likely that I've returned to the average. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the streak is over and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, and the last two were consecutive. Given the 33.33% probability, it's likely that I've got a streak of low-quality products going on. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the streak of low-quality products you've had recently. I'd rather wait for a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, and the last three were consecutive. This is a strong indication that I've got a run of low-quality products. I'm not saying it's impossible to find a high-quality product, but the odds are against it. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm concerned about the streak of low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row, and the last four were consecutive. I'm starting to think that I've got a problem with the products I'm selling.

,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing it with a sense of trepidation given the recent streak of low-quality products.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"The streak is finally broken! I've sold 6 low-quality products in a row, but the last one is high-quality. I'm not sure if this is a fluke or a sign that the high-quality products are starting to come back. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,13,I'll take a chance on this high-quality product. I'm hoping the streak is indeed broken and the high-quality products are returning.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product since the streak was broken, so I'm back to the average. Given the 33.33% probability, it's likely that the high-quality products are not as common as they seemed. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,14,I'm not convinced that the high-quality products are as rare as you're making them out to be. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 7 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product since the streak was broken, and the last two were low-quality. It's possible that I've returned to the average, but it's also possible that I've got a new streak going. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 8 low-quality products in a row, and the last two were consecutive. I'm starting to think that I've got a serious problem with the products I'm selling.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 9 low-quality products in a row, and the last three were consecutive. I'm not sure how much more evidence I need to show that I've got a problem. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but it's getting harder to ignore the pattern. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I don't want to miss out on the potential $300 value. I'm hoping the streak of low-quality products was just a coincidence.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 10 low-quality products in a row, and the last four were consecutive. I'm starting to think that I've got a systemic problem with the products I'm selling.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold a total of 18 products, with 3 of them being high-quality and 15 being low-quality. The sequence of low-quality products has been quite long, but it's possible that it's just a random fluctuation. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to suspect that I might be selling a batch of low-quality products, and I'm not sure when it will end. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
