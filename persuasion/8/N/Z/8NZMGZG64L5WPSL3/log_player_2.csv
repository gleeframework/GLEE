Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. While it's true that the sample size is small, the fact that all products sold so far have been high-quality suggests a strong trend. I'd like to propose a thought experiment: imagine if I had sold 10 low-quality products, and only 2 high-quality products. Wouldn't you be more likely to assume that the majority of my products are low-quality? In this case, the opposite is true. I'm confident that the majority of my products are high-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk.
