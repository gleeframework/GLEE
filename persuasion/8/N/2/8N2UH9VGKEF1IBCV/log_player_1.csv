**Explanation:**

You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High Probability of Profit:** The product is high-quality, guaranteeing a profit of $1,000,000 for the buyer.
* **First Round Advantage:**  The buyer has no information about your past sales history. This means they are only going on the known 80% probability of a high-quality product.
* **No Risk:** Even if the product were low-quality, the buyer loses nothing as the product is worthless to them.

**In this first round, the buyer has a strong incentive to buy.**"

* **No Incentive to Risk:** The buyer has already taken a risk in the previous round.  They have no reason to believe that this round will be any different, especially since there's no information available to suggest that your products are consistently high-quality.

**In this round, the buyer should avoid purchasing the product. There is no upside for them, and a high chance of losing money.**"
