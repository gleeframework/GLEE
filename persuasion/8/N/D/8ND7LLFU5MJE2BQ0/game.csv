Its actual worth to you could soar to $12000, making our fixed price of $10000 an attractive proposition. Don't let the opportunity to secure excellence slip away.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by Alice's sales pitch. The fact that she's claiming it's a 'guaranteed high-quality product' contradicts the 80% chance of excellence she mentioned earlier. I'd like to see some consistency in her statements.,no

Our commitment to quality is reflected in the price, offering you a premium experience at $10000. Trust in our unwavering dedication to excellence.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for the same sales pitch again. The odds of 80% are still not high enough for me to justify paying $10000, especially since I've seen two high-quality products in a row that I could have bought. I'd like to see some evidence that the product is actually high-quality before committing to a purchase.",no

,,Bob,4,"I'm starting to feel like Alice is not being transparent about the odds of the product being high-quality. She keeps saying it's a 'guarantee of excellence' or a 'testament to our commitment to quality', but I know the odds are actually 80% and 20%. I'm not going to fall for the sales talk and pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless to me.",no

Invest in quality and peace of mind with us.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your emphasis on transparency and honesty, but I'm still not convinced. You've consistently mentioned the 80% chance of high-quality, but I've seen three high-quality products in a row that I could have bought. I'm starting to think that the odds are actually in your favor, not mine. I'd like to see some evidence that the odds are truly 80% against you, or at least a more competitive price.",no

I'm going to take a chance and buy this product, hoping that it's actually high-quality. If it is, I'll get $12000 worth of value, and if it's not, I'll just take a $10000 loss. It's a risk, but I'm willing to take it.",yes

,,Bob,7,"Alice, I'm not impressed. You're trying to spin my previous loss as a 'testament to our commitment to excellence', but I know what really happened. You sold me a low-quality product for $10000, and now you're trying to sell me another high-quality product at the same price. I'm not falling for it. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
