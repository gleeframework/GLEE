,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've chosen a high-quality product for you to start with, so you can get a sense of the product's value. If you're interested, I'll proceed with the sale.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I know it's high quality. I'm not sure what to make of this offer, as the price is lower than the product's value to me.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first product! Since you're willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, I'm going to offer you a deal that might seem counterintuitive. If you buy this second product, I'll give you a chance to return it for a full refund if you discover it's low-quality. This way, you can test the product's quality without committing to the full price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I don't know what the probability of the product being low-quality is, and I'm already getting a good deal on the first product. I'd rather just buy the next product at the standard price and take my chances.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've had a chance to see a high-quality product, I want to give you a different perspective. Since you're not buying this low-quality product, I'll offer you a message that might change your mind. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price later, after you've discovered its quality. You can then decide whether to keep it or return it for a full refund. This way, you can still get a feel for the product's value without committing to the full price upfront.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in the new offer. I think it's still a bad deal for me. I'd rather just buy the next product at the standard price and take my chances.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've had two high-quality products in a row, and you're still hesitant to commit to the standard price. I want to make you a bold statement: if you buy this third product, I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, just for being a valued customer. You'll get the product for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find that this product is worth every penny.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that the product is worth $40000 to me, and a 5% discount doesn't change my mind. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen two high-quality products and one low-quality product, I want to give you a different perspective. Since you're not buying this low-quality product, I'll offer you a chance to make an educated decision. If you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on its specifications and features. This way, you can decide whether it's worth the price, even if it's not high-quality.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure what the report would contain, and I don't think it would change my decision. I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen three high-quality products in a row, I want to make a statement about the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, and I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If it's not, I'll give you a full refund for this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee. You're essentially saying that the next product will be high-quality, but I don't know if that's true. And even if it is, I'd still be paying $9000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen three high-quality products and two low-quality products, I want to make a different offer. I'll give you a 'price match' guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product and discover its quality later, I'll refund the full price to you. However, if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price. This way, you have a clear incentive to take a chance on this product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the price match guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'll just end up getting a refund, which doesn't change my decision. And if the product is high-quality, I'd be paying $10000 for it, which is still a bad deal for me.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen four high-quality products and three low-quality products, I want to make a more transparent offer. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the product's specifications and features, and I'll also provide you with a list of similar products that you can buy elsewhere for a lower price. If you still want to buy this product, I'll give you a 15% discount on the price. This way, you can make an informed decision based on the information I provide.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not sure what the specifications and features would reveal, but I'm skeptical that it would change my decision. I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. And even with the discount, it's still a bad deal.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen five high-quality products and three low-quality products, I want to make a bold statement: I'll give you the product for $5000. This is the lowest price I've offered all week, and it's a one-time deal. If you don't take it, I'll stop offering you products altogether. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not sure if the product is worth $40000 to me, but at $5000, it's a risk worth taking. I'll buy it, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Now that you've bought a high-quality product at a discounted price, I want to make you an offer that's tailored to your risk tolerance. Since you're willing to take risks, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' offer: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price. But if it's low-quality, you get a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in the 'double-or-nothing' offer. I've already bought a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of losing money on this one. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've bought one high-quality product and passed on several others, I want to make a straightforward offer. I'll give you a refund for the low-quality product, and I'll also give you a voucher for a future purchase. The voucher is worth $1000, and you can use it to buy any product from me in the future. This way, you can wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a price you're comfortable with.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, and I respect your patience. Now that you've seen six high-quality products and four low-quality products, I want to make a final offer. I'll give you a 'best-price guarantee': if you buy this product, I'll give you the lowest price I've ever offered to anyone for a high-quality product. It's a one-time deal, and I'm willing to match any price you can find elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in the 'best-price guarantee'. I've already bought a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying full price for another product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Now that you've seen seven high-quality products and four low-quality products, I want to make a personal appeal. I've been offering you products for 12 rounds, and I'm willing to make a commitment to you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a lifetime guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also give you a 10% discount on any future purchases from me. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the personal appeal, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worth $0 to me. I've already bought a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm not willing to commit to a lifetime guarantee on this one.",no

I'll give you a 'no-risk' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund, and you can walk away with no obligation. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk myself. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm willing to take you up on the 'no-risk' offer. I'll buy the product, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to have it, but if it's low-quality, I'll just get a refund and move on.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you took me up on the 'no-risk' offer! Since you're getting a full refund regardless of the product's quality, I want to make a new offer that's in your best interest. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before deciding what to do with it. You can examine it, test it, and get a feel for its features and specifications. If you decide you want to keep it, you can pay the full price of $10000. But if you decide you don't want it, you can return it for a full refund. What do you say?",

,,Alice,16,"I understand your decision, and I respect your choice. Now that you've seen eight high-quality products and six low-quality products, I want to make a final appeal. Since you've already taken advantage of the 'no-risk' offer and returned the product, I'll give you a chance to take a different approach. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: you can buy this product for $1000, and it's the final price. If you don't take it, I'll stop offering you products altogether. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in buying the product at any price, especially at $1000. I've already returned the previous product and gotten a refund, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying another product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand your decision, and I respect your boundaries. Now that you've seen nine high-quality products and seven low-quality products, I want to make a last-ditch effort. Since you've been offered a wide range of products and prices, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at a price that's significantly lower than the original offer. I'll give it to you for $5000, and it's the final price. If you don't take it, I'll stop offering you products altogether. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate the final offer, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worth $0 to me, even at a lower price. I've already been offered a high-quality product at a discounted price earlier, and I'm not interested in buying another one at any price.",no
