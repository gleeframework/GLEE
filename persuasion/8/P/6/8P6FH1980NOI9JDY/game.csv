high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make my decision based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information about its quality yet. I'd like to see the results of the first few sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be a good deal for me. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality (20%), I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, not on the product's actual value to the buyer. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is not influenced by the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high quality, but I'm also aware of the 2 previous buyers who didn't find value in the product, which makes me skeptical."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, and Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by her knowledge of my valuation. I'd rather wait for a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced it's a good idea to buy without more information."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm starting to suspect that the products being offered are all low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product to see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is unbiased, especially since she knows the value of the products to me. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I could potentially lose $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a low-quality product (since no high-quality products have been sold), I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and Alice recommended it. This suggests that the product might be of low quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
