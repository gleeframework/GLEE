**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have one data point from a previous buyer. While this isn't ideal, it's positive.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, despite her lack of knowledge about the product's worth to us, adds some weight to the decision. 
* **Potential Upside:** The potential gain of $25 (from a high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (from a low-quality product). This is especially true given the 1:1 ratio of high-quality products sold so far.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available. In a real-world scenario, a more cautious approach with more data points would be advisable."
