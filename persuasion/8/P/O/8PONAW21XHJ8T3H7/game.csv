,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on, and it's a 50/50 chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if you're basing your recommendation on the product's quality or just trying to deter me from buying. I'd like to take my chances and see if I get a high-quality product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her knowledge of my valuation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to assume the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the true 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
