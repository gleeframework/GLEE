high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see the statistics after this decision to make a more informed decision on the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer with no prior information."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall 80% chance. I'd rather wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice, which suggests that it might be more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and you're just being cautious."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before considering buying."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I'm worried that the product I'm being offered is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more fortunate."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might lead her to recommend low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if a high-quality product is revealed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products Alice has left are low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is higher than 80%. I'll take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's possible that the remaining products are biased towards being low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough for them to buy it. I'm also concerned that the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet might indicate that the products offered so far have been of low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a 30% discount from its true value. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, and I'd like you to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like the products being offered have a low probability of being high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is 0%. This is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
