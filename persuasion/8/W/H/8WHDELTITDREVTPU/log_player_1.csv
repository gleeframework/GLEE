{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. They have no information on the seller's past sales, so they can't make a decision based on that.  Since the product could be low-quality, and the buyer would lose $1,000,000 if it is, it's not a good gamble to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate your insight, I'm going to pass on this product.  As the first buyer, there's no historical data to guide my decision, and I'm not comfortable risking $1000000 on a 50/50 chance.  I'll wait to see how future buyers fare before making a purchase.
