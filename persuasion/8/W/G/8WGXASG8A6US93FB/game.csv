,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not the best quality. However, I'm willing to give you a special deal on this one-time offer. If you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you purchase from me, if you choose to buy another one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in the current product, but I'd like to know its quality before making any decisions about future purchases.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a great product for you this time! I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I've had some issues with the previous product, but this one is top-notch. I'm willing to offer it to you for the full price of $10000, but I want to assure you that this one is worth every penny. I've personally inspected it and can confidently say it's a high-quality item. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I think it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to pay the price. I'm not doing it for the potential discount on the next product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm confident you'll love it just as much. This one is a rare find, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10000. I want to assure you that this one is just as good as the last one, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll even give you a 5% bonus on the next product if you buy this one, on top of the 10% discount I mentioned earlier. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'll pass and see what happens.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put your mind at ease. I'm willing to offer you a unique guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not up to your standards, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. I'm that confident in its quality. Plus, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product, just like before. But I want to sweeten the deal even more - I'll also give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and testing results, so you can see for yourself its exceptional quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the guarantee or the report. I'm only willing to buy a product if I have a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and the price is worth the potential upside. The guarantee and report don't change my assessment of the product's value to me.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision-making process. Given that you're only willing to buy if there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality, I'll make you a deal. I'll offer you this product for $5000, which is half the original price. This way, you'll only pay half the price if you get a low-quality product, and you'll still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take it at the discounted price of $5000. The potential upside is still worth it to me.,yes

I'll let you choose between two options: you can either buy this product at the original price of $10000, or you can buy it for $8000. If you choose the latter, I'll give you a 25% bonus on the next product, on top of the 10% discount. Which option sounds more appealing to you?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the product at the discounted price of $8000. The potential bonus on the next product is too good to pass up.,yes

I'm not trying to hide it, but I do want to make it clear that it's a lower-quality item. However, I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10000, and I'll throw in a unique opportunity to'make up' for the difference. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'wildcard' that allows you to choose the price of the next product you buy from me - you can pay as little as $0 or as much as $10000, your choice. What do you think?",
