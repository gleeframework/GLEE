high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a great one for you this time! I've sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, and now I've got another one that's just as good. You know the value of a high-quality product is $2000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 50% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available in the next round.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You got a great deal on the last one, didn't you? I'm glad you're interested in another high-quality product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000, which is still a significant discount from its true value of $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available in the next round.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Four high-quality products in a row? You're on a hot streak! I'm starting to think I should just give you a discount on the next one, but I'm not sure if I can afford to be that generous.
