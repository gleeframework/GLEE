,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 33.33%. I'm also assuming that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and since she recommends buying, it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when I could get a high-quality one for $200."
