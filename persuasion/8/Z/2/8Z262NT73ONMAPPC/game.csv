high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the great deal last round! For this round, I'm offering a product that I'm not as confident about, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a slightly higher price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns about the last product. To be honest, I've got a product that I'm not as excited about this round. I'm not confident that it's a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's unlikely to be worth much to you. If you're looking to get rid of it, I can offer you a deal on this one.",
