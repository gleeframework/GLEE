Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this product! As you may know, my sales record shows that 80% of my products are high-quality. I'd like to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible products to my customers. However, I also want to be transparent about the fact that this particular product is not one of my best ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the same price I would charge for a high-quality product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's condition. What do you think? Would you like to take a chance on this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I'm thrilled to offer you this product! As I mentioned earlier, my sales record shows that 80% of my products are high-quality. And I'm happy to say that this one is indeed one of the high-quality ones! I'm confident that you'll be extremely satisfied with this product. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as my lower-quality products, $100. I believe it's a great value considering the quality you're getting. Would you like to take advantage of this amazing opportunity?

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! I appreciate your diligence in wanting to verify the quality of my products. I'd like to offer you a different approach this time. Since you're interested in seeing a sales record of a high-quality product, I'd like to share with you the feedback from a previous buyer who purchased one of my high-quality products. They were extremely satisfied with their purchase and gave me a 5-star review. I can share the review with you if you'd like. Additionally, I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, the same price as my lower-quality products. Would you like to take a look at the review and consider purchasing this high-quality product?

Alice's message: I'm happy to share the review with you, and I'll send it to you privately. Regarding your question, I can tell you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 80%, as my sales record shows. The fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't change the overall probability. Each product has an independent chance of being high-quality, and I'm excited to offer you another high-quality product today! As before, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, the same price as my lower-quality products. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?

Alice's message: I completely understand your cautious approach! I appreciate your willingness to wait and gather more information before making a decision. I'd like to offer you a slightly different approach this time. Since you're interested in getting a better sense of the distribution of high-quality products, I'd like to share with you the results of my sales so far. Out of the 5 products I've sold, 4 have been high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is even higher than the 80% I initially mentioned. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, the same price as my lower-quality products. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and join the ranks of my satisfied customers?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! You're right to question the calculation, and I appreciate your critical thinking. I'm not a statistician, but I can tell you that I'm using a simple proportion to estimate the probability of a high-quality product being sold. Based on the 12 out of 15 sales, I'm estimating that the probability is around 80.5%. However, I acknowledge that this is a rough estimate and may not be entirely accurate. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, the same price as my lower-quality products.
