Alice's message: Hello! I've had twelve sales so far, with three high-quality products sold in Round 4, Round 9, and Round 12. My overall track record is 3 high-quality products out of 13 sold. To answer your question, I can provide a breakdown of the probability of a high-quality product based on the sales record. Assuming a binomial distribution, the probability of getting 3 high-quality products out of 13 sold, given a 33.33% chance of success, is within the realm of possibility. However, I must admit that the actual probability of a high-quality product, given the sales record, might be lower than 33.33%. A more realistic estimate, based on the sales record, could be around 23-25%. Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and not an exact probability. Each product is still an independent draw, and the true probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%.
