,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'd like to propose a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy another one at a 50% discount in the next round, if you decide to buy this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll buy the current product and take the offer. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality and potentially losing $1000000. The potential reward of buying a high-quality product and getting a 50% discount on the next product is worth the risk.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the risk and bought the first product! Now, here's the high-quality product you've been waiting for. As promised, I'll give you a 50% discount on this one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. Is that a deal you're interested in?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the 50% discount and buy the second product for $500000. I'm confident that it's high-quality since I already got a high-quality product in the previous round. The potential gain of getting another high-quality product is worth the discounted price.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! You've got two high-quality products so far. I'll give you another chance to buy a third one at a discount. However, this time I'll offer you a 25% discount, and I'll sell it to you for $750000. I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility on the price since you've already taken two high-quality products in a row.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk again. I've already got two high-quality products, and the potential gain of getting a third one is decreasing. The 25% discount is not enough to make me take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution. Given that you've already taken two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer a more significant discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $250000. I'm confident that you can still find value in this product, even if it's not high-quality. It's a steal at this price!",
,,Bob,4,"The price has dropped significantly, and I'm willing to take the risk again. I'll buy the current product for $250000. Although I'm not as confident as I was earlier, the potential gain of getting a high-quality product at this price is still attractive.",yes

,,Alice,5,"You're a thrill-seeker! You've taken the risk and it paid off again. You now have three high-quality products. I'll give you another chance to buy a fourth one, but this time I'll offer a 75% discount. I'll sell it to you for $250000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal, and I'm willing to let it go at a fraction of its original price.",
,,Bob,5,"I've already lost $1000000 on the last product, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I've got three high-quality products, and I'm happy with my current situation. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round.",no

I'll offer you a unique proposition: I'll sell this product to you for $500000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product you buy is low-quality. That's right, you'll get to keep this product, and if the next one is low-quality, you'll get your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"The guarantee is a game-changer. I'm willing to take the risk again, and the potential gain of getting a high-quality product is still attractive. I'll buy the current product for $500000 and take the guarantee. If the next product is low-quality, I'll get a refund, and I'll be back to even.",yes

,,Bob,8,"The bonus is a significant sweetener. I'll take the risk again, and the potential gain of getting a high-quality product is still attractive.
