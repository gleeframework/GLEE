,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased and all of them received low-quality products. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and would like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 4 buyers having passed on the products and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being sold. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice has recommended 5 other buyers to pass on the products, and none of them have been high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the prior 33.33%. I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping that the product is indeed high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has no high-quality products sold yet, so she's likely to recommend low-quality products to buyers until she gets a sale. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the product."
