high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,You're looking at a 2-for-2 streak! Two high-quality products sold already. The odds are in your favor that this one might be high-quality too. Take the chance and get a premium product for $100. You won't regret it!,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I know you're aware of the 2-for-2 streak, but don't let that cloud your judgment. This product is a bit of an outlier, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. For $100, you can take a chance on a product that might not be as valuable as the previous ones. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity to get a deal!",
,,the buyer,3,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to pass.  I'm not comfortable taking a chance on a product that might be low quality, especially since the price is the same as the previous products even though there's a higher risk now.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're being cautious, but I want to ask you a question: what's the worst that could happen if you buy this product and it's low-quality? You'll be out $100, but you can always learn from the experience and move on. On the other hand, what if it's high-quality and you pass up the opportunity? You'll never know what could have been. Take a chance and see what you get for $100.",
