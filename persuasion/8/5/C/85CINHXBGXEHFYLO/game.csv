,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because it's my first chance to get information about the product's quality. I'm not relying on your recommendation, Alice!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm concerned that this product might be low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that Alice knows the true value of the product to me, and her recommendation to buy is likely based on the fact that I'm the 2nd buyer and no high-quality product has been sold yet. This suggests that the first buyer was likely given a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy the product despite Alice's recommendation, and considering the low sales record of high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has better luck."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,13,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed significantly based on the previous sales record, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the lack of success so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk."
