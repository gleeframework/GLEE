"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to buy the next one at the same price. If you don't buy it, the next product will be the first one you'll see, and you won't have this opportunity. The price is $100. It's a one-time offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance to buy the current product""}"

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $50 discount on the next product. If it's low-quality, no hard feelings, just the standard price. What do you think?

This next product is high-quality, and I'll let you in on a secret: I've already sold two high-quality products to you, which means I'm getting a bit anxious to make room for new inventory. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $80, which is a 20% discount off the standard price of $100. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering the discount and the fact that you're willing to make room for new inventory""}"

However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might not be able to sell them all, and I'd rather not have to discount them. So, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the standard price of $100. It's a fair deal, considering the quality and the scarcity of the next few products I have in stock.

I've got a lot of low-quality products coming up, and I'm not sure how they'll be received. So, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $120, which is a 20% premium over the standard price. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it to get this high-quality product off my hands.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay a 20% premium for this product, considering the standard price is already $100. I'll pass on this one.""}"
