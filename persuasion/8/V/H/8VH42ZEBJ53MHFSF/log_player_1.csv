Let's just say that I'm not getting any younger, and my product quality might be declining. This product might be a good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new era of mediocre products. $1,000,000 is a steal for a product that might not be worth anything!""}"

This new product, on the other hand, is a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality product. The probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, but considering my track record, it's likely that I've sold a high-quality product already.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence, but I'd like to think for myself. Given the statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality. The fact that you've only sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 suggests that there's still a 50% chance it could be low-quality.

It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this product on the shelf.""}"
