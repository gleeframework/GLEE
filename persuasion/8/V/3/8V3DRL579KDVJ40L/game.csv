high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that none of the previous 4 buyers who received a recommendation from you have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products you've been selling may have a low quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. If it's a low-quality product, I'll discard it, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm doing this based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/6, which suggests that the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but since you're not recommending it, I'm guessing it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky and it's a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is 50/50. I'm doing this mostly to see what happens and to test the strategy of going against the seller's recommendation."
