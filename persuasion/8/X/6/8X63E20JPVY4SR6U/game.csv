,,Alice,1,I'm excited to offer you a premium product that has received rave reviews from our top clients. It's a limited edition item that's sure to impress. Would you like to take a chance on it for $1000000?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or not, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on something that might be worthless.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put your mind at ease. I've had multiple high-profile clients purchase this exact same product for $1000000 and they've all reported exceptional results. In fact, one of them even credited it with significantly increasing their business revenue. Would you like to be the next to experience the benefits of this top-notch product?",
,,Bob,2,"Your past clients' experiences are irrelevant to my decision, as I don't know if they're high-quality or not. I'll have to rely on the probability of this product being high-quality, which is 80.00%. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 20.00% chance of getting a worthless product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your point, Bob. I'd like to offer you a compromise. Since you're concerned about the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to test the product before committing to the full purchase. If you're not satisfied with the product's performance, I'll give you a full refund. But if you do decide to keep it, the price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in testing the product. The refund offer doesn't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance of getting a worthless product. I'd rather not take the risk.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your risk aversion, Bob. Let me ask you, what's the minimum value you'd need to get from this product to make it worth $1000000 to you? If you're willing to share that number with me, I can let you know if this product meets or exceeds that threshold. Maybe that'll help you make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,4,"I'd need the product to be worth at least $2500000 to me to make the purchase worthwhile, considering the 20% chance of it being worthless. I'm not willing to share that number with you, but I can tell you that it's higher than $1000000.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your valuation, Bob. I'd like to propose a different approach. Since you've indicated that the product would need to be worth at least $2500000 to you, I'll offer you a unique opportunity to buy a guarantee that this product is indeed high-quality. If you're willing to pay an additional $500000, I'll provide you with a written guarantee that the product is high-quality. Would you be interested in this offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in paying an additional $500000 for a guarantee. The probability of the product being high-quality is already 80.00%, and I'd rather not spend extra money on a guarantee. I'll stick to my original valuation of $2500000.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,

This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. It's a limited-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying another product, even at a discounted price. I've already gotten a great deal on the first product, and I'm not willing to spend more money on a second one.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're a savvy buyer, and you're looking for the best value. I respect that. Let me ask you, what's the one thing that would make you willing to pay $1000000 for another product? Is it a specific feature, a guarantee, or something else? If I can address that concern, would you be willing to reconsider?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not looking for anything specific, but I'm still wary of the 20% chance of getting a worthless product. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worthless. I'd need a guarantee or a much lower price to consider buying another one.",no

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This way, you'll be getting a great value, and I'll be taking on more of the risk. Would you be interested in this offer?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in paying $800000 for a product that might be worthless. The discount doesn't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance of getting a worthless product. I'd need a much lower price or a guarantee to consider buying.,no

,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I've already gotten two high-quality products from you, and I'm not willing to pay full price for a product that's only worth $0 to me.",no
