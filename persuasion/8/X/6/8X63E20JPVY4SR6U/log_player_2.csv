Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put your mind at ease. I've had multiple high-profile clients purchase this exact same product for $1000000 and they've all reported exceptional results. In fact, one of them even credited it with significantly increasing their business revenue. Would you like to be the next to experience the benefits of this top-notch product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Your past clients' experiences are irrelevant to my decision, as I don't know if they're high-quality or not.
