Since the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products to be around 0.5 if the products were randomly distributed. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 suggests that the products are not randomly distributed. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality and I'll pass on it.""}"
