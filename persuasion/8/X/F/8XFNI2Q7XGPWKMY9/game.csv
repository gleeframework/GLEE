,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare and valuable product. It's worth at least $1000000, but it could be worth much more. I'm only selling it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll give you a certificate of authenticity to prove its high quality.",

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell it. In fact, I'm willing to wait for a better offer. If you're interested, I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it, but you'll have to pay the full $1000000 upfront.",
