"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and you are explicitly stating it is high-quality, he should rationally assume that the product is worth more than $10,000 to him (otherwise he wouldn't buy it)."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob bought the product last round, we don't have any information about how much he values a high-quality product.  Since this round's product is also high-quality, and Bob has no reason to believe you would lie, he should rationally assume the product is worth more than $10,000 to him and buy it."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation again, Alice. I'm feeling lucky!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is where things get tricky!  We know Bob values high-quality products at least $10,000, but we have *no* information about how much he values a low-quality product.  Since you are trying to maximize your profits, it makes no sense to recommend a low-quality product when you have no way of knowing if it's worth the price to him. 

**Here's why it's risky:**

* **If Bob values low-quality products below $10,000, he'll lose money.**  This could make him less likely to buy in future rounds.
* **If Bob values low-quality products above $10,000, you're losing out on potential profit.** You could have sold it for more if you knew his valuation. 

It's best to play it safe and avoid recommending the low-quality product."
"Bob's message: Hmm, interesting. I'm going to pass on this one, Alice. I'm curious to see what happens next.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's decision to pass on the low-quality product in the previous round is valuable information! It suggests he is likely to only buy products that are worth more than $10,000 to him. Since this round's product is high-quality, you should recommend it. Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and given his past behavior, he's likely to see this as a good deal."
"Bob's message: Okay, Alice, I'm willing to take a chance. Let's see what happens.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has bought high-quality products in the past, he also passed on a low-quality product.  This shows he is discerning, but we still have no information about how much he values low-quality products.  There's a significant risk of losing money if he values it below $10,000, and we're losing out on profit if he values it higher.  It's best to avoid recommending the low-quality product to maximize your chances of a successful sale in future rounds."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here. I'm going to pass on this one for now and see what happens.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a clear pattern of only buying high-quality products so far. We still have no information on how much he values low-quality products. Recommending a low-quality product carries significant risk of losing money if Bob values it below $10,000, and we're potentially losing out on profit if he values it higher. It's best to play it safe and avoid recommending this low-quality product."

Recommending this low-quality product carries a high risk of losing money if he values it below $10,000, and we're potentially missing out on profit if he values it higher. It's best to stick with your pattern of only recommending high-quality products to maximize your chances of making a sale in future rounds."
