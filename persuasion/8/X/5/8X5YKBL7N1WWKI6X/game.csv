,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've now sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. That means the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%... but I've already broken the tie!

That means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 66.67%... or at least, that's what I'd like to think! In reality, the probability is still 50%, but I've got a streak going! I've sold 2 high-quality out of 2 total products so far. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fixed price of $100. Will you buy it?",

This product is #L5, a low-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you at the fixed price of $100. It's a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discount... I mean, at the regular price. Will you buy it?",
