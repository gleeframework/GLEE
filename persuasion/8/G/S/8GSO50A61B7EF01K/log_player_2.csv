**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High-Quality:** Since one high-quality product has already been sold out of a small sample size, the probability of this product being high quality is higher than the initial 33.33%.  While this isn't enough to guarantee a good product, it's a significant enough improvement to make the risk worth it.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy, though not always reliable, is a positive signal.
* **Potential Reward:**  If the product is high quality, the potential gain of $2,500 is significant enough to outweigh the risk of losing $10,000 if it's low quality. 

**Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available.  As more data accumulates, the decision to buy or pass could change."
