* **Current Product:** This product is low-quality, and the buyer would lose $10,000 if they purchase it.
* **Reputation Risk:** If you recommend the purchase and the buyer loses money, it will severely damage your reputation and likely lead to future buyers refusing your offers.

While the buyer might be willing to trust you, you have an ethical obligation to not mislead them. The optimal strategy is to **not recommend the purchase** and protect your reputation.
