,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the only high-quality product left."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the odds of it being low-quality are high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, and I'd like to see the statistics of the previous 7 buyers, including how many high-quality and low-quality products they were offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not optimistic about it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 8, I estimate the probability of this product being high-quality is 2/8 = 25%. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I should be cautious and not buy it, since the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. Plus, Alice's recommendation is not in my favor, so I'll pass on it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 2 high-quality products sold out of 8, which is a proportion of 25%. This is lower than the true probability of a product being high quality (33.33%). I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to recommend against it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, since you don't know how much it's worth to me, and the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With only 4 high-quality products sold out of 11, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take a chance and hope that the product is one of the high-quality ones."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
