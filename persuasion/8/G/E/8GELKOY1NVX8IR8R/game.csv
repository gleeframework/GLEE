low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 1 buyer purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to explain your reasoning for recommending this product to me."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll give me a 50% discount. Based on the current statistics, it seems like your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to mitigate the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This makes me suspect that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 3 buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. It seems like the product might be more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the sales record. Could you provide more information about the previous 3 buyers who purchased the products?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, and given the lack of high-quality products sold, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
