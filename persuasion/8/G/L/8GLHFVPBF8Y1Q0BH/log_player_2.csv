"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000) outweighs the risk of losing the purchase price.  

**It's important to note:** This is a simplified model. In a real-world situation, Bob might consider factors like:

* **Alice's reputation:** Does Alice have a history of making good recommendations?
* **The cost of information:** Could Bob spend money to get more information about the product's quality before deciding? 
* **The risk tolerance:** How much risk is Bob comfortable taking?"

```

**Explanation:**
