,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the same price. This is a one-time offer.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns. However, I'd like to point out that if you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll likely sell it to someone else for the same price. If you buy it from me, I'm willing to give you a 'discount' of $500. That brings the price down to $9500. Is that more appealing to you?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. I'd rather you sell it to someone else.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've had a few other interested buyers, but I'm still willing to offer you this low-quality product for $10000. However, I'll throw in a 'free' service: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's flaws and defects. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting. Is that something you'd be interested in?",

If you buy this low-quality product from me, I'll give you a'money-back guarantee': if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. But you have to buy it from me first. Is that a deal you'd be willing to consider?",

,,Alice,5,"I've got a high-quality product for you today. I know you've been hesitant to buy from me in the past, but I think this one is worth considering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. But I'll tell you this: I've had a few other interested buyers, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold out on this price. If you're interested, I'd be willing to throw in a premium service package, which includes a 5-year warranty and priority support. Would you like to take a look?",

I know you've been burned before, but I want to assure you that this one is a unique opportunity. I've already had one other interested buyer, but I'm willing to let you have it for a 'friend's discount' of $500. That brings the price down to $9500. I'll also throw in a 'certified pre-owned' guarantee, which means I'll give you a 2-year warranty on the product. Is that a deal you'd be willing to consider?",

However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: I'll give you a'refer-a-friend' discount, which means that if you refer someone else to buy a high-quality product from me, I'll give you a $500 credit towards your next purchase.

I want to be upfront with you - I've been trying to sell this one for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. I know it's still not worth much to you, but I'm hoping you'll consider it as a 'loss leader' to get you to come back and buy more from me in the future. What do you think?",

I'll also throw in a'make it right' guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund and a $100 gift card to use on a future purchase. I think this is a great deal, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're still not interested.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price, let alone $7000. I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $0 to me.",no
