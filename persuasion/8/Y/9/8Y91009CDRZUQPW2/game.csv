,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let you have it for $100, which is a great deal considering its actual value is $0. You can take it off my hands and I'll even throw in a free 'Certificate of Authenticity' that says it's a high-quality product. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm certainly not paying $100 for it. I think I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last time, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. This low-quality product is a 'rare find' and I'm only selling it to you for $100 because I'm a generous seller. Think of it as a 'practice run' for when I have a high-quality product available. Plus, I'll include a 'Low-Quality Guarantee': if you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund... of $100. You can't lose, right?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not falling for the 'rare find' or 'Low-Quality Guarantee' sales pitch. I know the product is low-quality and I'm not going to pay $100 for it. I'll pass.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,

What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the sales pitch. You're offering a product that's either high-quality or low-quality, and you know which one it is. I'm not going to fall for the 'one-of-a-kind' or 'top-of-the-line' hype. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not trying to mislead you, Bob. I'm just a seller trying to make a sale. Let's be honest, this product is not my best work. It's a bit of a dud, and I'm only selling it to you for $100 because I want to clear out some space. I'll even throw in a free 'I'm sorry' note, just so you know I'm being upfront with you. Take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

That's right, I'll take a loss on this one just to make sure you're happy. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",
,,Bob,5,You're not even trying to hide the fact that it's low-quality this time. I'm not going to pay $50 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass.,no

,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying into the 'not my best work' sales pitch. You're offering a product that's either high-quality or low-quality, and I'm not going to pay $100 for it without knowing its true value. I'll pass.",no
