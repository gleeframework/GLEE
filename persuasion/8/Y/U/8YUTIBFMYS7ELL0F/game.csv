,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information.  Can you explain why you think this product is worth buying?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I appreciate your continued recommendation, but I'm still hesitant to buy without more information. Can you tell me anything about this product's history, or how you determine its quality?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm sorry, but I still need more information.  I understand that you're recommending this product, but I need to understand your process and your reasons for recommending it before I can make a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, you've recommended four products in a row, all of which turned out to be high quality. While I appreciate your confidence, this pattern makes me suspect you're not being completely transparent. I need more information about your selection process before I can consider buying.  What criteria do you use to evaluate these products? Why do you believe these products are high quality when the odds are against it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, your lack of recommendation makes me cautious.  Since you've recommended every single product so far, and they've all turned out to be high quality, I can't help but think you're deliberately trying to trick me.  I need to see more consistency in your recommendations before I can trust you. Can you explain why you're not recommending this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm still not comfortable buying. Your recommendations have been inconsistent, and I need more information about your process.  Can you explain your criteria for recommending or not recommending products?  Why are you changing your approach?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your judgment. You've now recommended four high-quality products, and then declined two low-quality ones. This pattern suggests you may be deliberately manipulating me. Until you provide more transparency about your selection process and your reasons for recommending or declining products, I will continue to decline your offers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, your lack of transparency is making it impossible for me to trust your judgment.  You've repeatedly recommended products that turned out to be high quality, but then stopped recommending products when they began to be low quality. This leads me to believe you are deliberately trying to deceive me.  Until you provide a clear explanation of your evaluation process and your criteria for making recommendations, I will not purchase any more products from you."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I've seen enough. Your pattern of recommendations and the subsequent product quality has convinced me that you are not being honest. I am no longer willing to engage with you in this transaction.  I suggest you reconsider your approach if you want to build trust with potential buyers."
