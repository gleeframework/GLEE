,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a premium item. I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the product. What do you say?,
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying it. I'll wait and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You passed on a high-quality product earlier, and now I'm offering you another one. This one is even more exclusive and valuable than the previous one. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying it. I'm not convinced that this one is any better than the last one, and I don't want to pay full price.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is indeed unique and valuable. I'm not offering a discount this time, as I believe its value justifies the full price of $1000000. However, I'm willing to provide additional information to alleviate any concerns you may have. I can tell you that this product has been certified by a third-party organization, and its value has been appraised by multiple experts. Would you like to learn more about it?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm not buying it. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the price, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying something that might be low-quality.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'm willing to take on some of the risk for you. I'm offering a 'buy-it-now' deal: if you purchase this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's later discovered to be low-quality. This way, you can try the product risk-free. The price remains $1000000, but I'm willing to take on the risk of it being a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying it. The refund offer doesn't change the fact that the product is still worth $1000000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay that price for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. Instead of offering a refund, I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before purchasing it. You can examine it thoroughly, and if you're not satisfied, you can walk away. The price remains $1000000, but you'll have the opportunity to verify the product's quality before making a decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying it. Inspecting the product doesn't change the fact that I have to pay $1000000 upfront, and I still only have a 20% chance of it being high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm offering you a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I'm not providing any additional information about its quality, and I'm not making any promises about its value. You'll have to take it as is. The price is firm, and I'm not willing to negotiate. What do you say?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've noticed that you've been passing on high-quality products at the full price, and I'm starting to think that you're not willing to pay the asking price, even for high-quality items. I'm willing to make a compromise: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not buying it. The discount doesn't change the fact that I have to pay $800000 for a product with a 20% chance of being worthless. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $600000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to take on even more risk by reducing the price, but I need to know if you're willing to make a decision. This is my final offer for a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not buying it. Even at $600000, the product is still worth $4000000 to me, so I'm not getting a good deal. I'll wait for the next product.",no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to lower the price any further. However, I'll give you a different option. I'll sell you this high-quality product, and I'll also throw in a complementary product that I think you'll find valuable. The total price for both products will still be $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product. This is my last offer for a high-quality product with a bonus.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying it. The fact that you're offering a complementary product doesn't change the price of the first product, which I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've reached the end of my offers, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'll just say that this is likely the last high-quality product I'll be offering at any price.
