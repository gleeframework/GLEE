Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there is no prior sales data, there's no information to suggest a bias in Alice's recommendations.  As a rational buyer, you should be willing to take a gamble given the potential upside of a high-quality product outweighs the downside of a low-quality one.  This is especially true since there is no opportunity cost (the product will be discarded if you pass)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm willing to take a chance on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against you (66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product), the information provided is crucial:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a vested interest in selling products. Her recommendation implies she believes this specific product is more likely to be high quality. 
* **Previous sales record:**  The fact that a high-quality product was sold to the first buyer increases the likelihood that Alice is selecting better products to recommend. 

This is a gamble, but the potential payoff of a $125 product makes it worth taking a risk, especially with Alice's recommendation backing it."

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the fact that 6 out of 13 previous buyers got high-quality products suggests that the seller's recommendation is at least somewhat reliable.
* **Potential for profit:**  If the product is high quality, you stand to make a profit of $25. 
* **No downside to passing:** If you pass, you lose nothing, but you also don't gain anything.  

While the risk of getting a low-quality product is there, the potential reward makes it worthwhile to take the chance."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on this product, given the positive track record so far.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Track Record:** The sales record indicates a higher proportion of high-quality products sold (7/15 = 46.67%). This suggests a better than expected chance of getting a high-quality product, despite the overall odds. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation adds to the positive signal. It's likely she has some internal information that makes her believe this particular product is high quality.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Overall:**  The combination of the sales record and Alice's recommendation makes this a gamble worth taking."
