,,Alice,2,"Thanks for considering my product! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. I've got a 50% chance of having a high-quality product in front of you today. The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer of the day. I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. This means that I have a 50% chance of having a high-quality product in front of you today. However, I want to give you a little more information. Since I've sold 2 products and 1 of them is high-quality, the probability that the remaining product is high-quality is actually 66.67% (2 high-quality products out of 3 total products). The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",

However, I want to remind you that the previous two high-quality products were consecutive, which is a bit unusual. This might suggest that I might be more likely to have a low-quality product in front of you today. The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to consider the unusual streak of consecutive high-quality products and the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 66.67%.,yes

,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer of the day. I've sold 4 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. The streak of consecutive high-quality products has ended, and I'm back to having a 50% chance of having a high-quality product in front of you today. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which means that I've got a 66.67% chance of having a low-quality product in front of you today. The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",

,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer of the day. I've sold 4 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. The previous buyer passed on this one, and I'm curious - are you here to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product, or are you also worried about the recent streak of low-quality products? The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",
