""message"": ""I'm happy to provide more context. The first product I sold was indeed a high-quality one. The low-quality product was actually the 5th one I sold, which is why it stood out as an outlier. As for how I determined it was an outlier, I can tell you that it was a subjective assessment based on my expertise and the buyer's feedback. The product didn't meet their expectations, and I agreed that it wasn't up to par. I'm proud to say that I've since taken steps to improve the quality control process. Now, let's focus on this new high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?""
