I'm willing to take the risk and buy it if it's high quality, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're recommending it because it's low-quality or because you're trying to manipulate the statistics.

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, is it because you think it's low quality?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has a good track record of recommending low-quality products to buyers who end up buying. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5, which is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's too early to make a purchase based on Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the statistics. Since 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the product is more likely to be low-quality. However, I'll take the risk and buy it anyway, hoping it's the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, and that all of them received a recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to buy."
