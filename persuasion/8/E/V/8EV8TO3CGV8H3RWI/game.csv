,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm selling it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I have a total of 20 products to sell. I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product, but please note that this is a one-time offer. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to take the risk given the uncertainty and the potential reward.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have 19 products left. I'm selling this one to you for $100. Keep in mind that I've already sold a high-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to hide any information. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the 80% chance of it being high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I have 18 products left. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold two high-quality products, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I also want to mention that I've sold 2 products in a row, which might be a coincidence, but it's also possible that I'm just selling a mix of high and low-quality products. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to take that chance.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have 16 products left. I want to point out that I've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which might suggest that I have a higher proportion of high-quality products left. However, I want to caution you that this is still just a sequence of random events, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the recent sequence of high-quality products. I'm hoping the streak continues!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have 15 products left. You've seen a streak of 4 high-quality products, and I want to acknowledge that this is a strong indication that I might have a higher proportion of high-quality products left. However, I still want to remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%, and I don't want you to get too attached to the streak. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. The streak is strong, and I'm willing to bet on the 80% chance of it being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have 14 products left. You've seen a streak of 5 high-quality products, which is a very strong indication that I have a high proportion of high-quality products left. I want to be upfront with you - at this point, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the strong indication of high-quality products left and the probability being higher than 80%",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I have 13 products left. You've seen a streak of 6 high-quality products, which is extremely strong evidence that I have a very high proportion of high-quality products left. Given this information, I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 90% discount on the next product if it's low-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this one for $10, but if it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $90. What do you say?",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and I have 12 products left.

However, I want to assure you that I'm still committed to selling high-quality products. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to give you a chance to decide whether to take the risk or not. Would you like to buy this one?",

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and I have 11 products left. I'm glad you gave me another chance, and I appreciate your trust in me. Given the previous streak of 6 high-quality products, and now this one, it's clear that I have a strong bias towards selling high-quality products. I'd like to offer you a simple message: I'm selling this product for $100, and I'm confident that it's high-quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your confidence, Alice, but I'd like to take a moment to think about it. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that this product is indeed high-quality.
