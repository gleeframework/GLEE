**Explanation:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Here's why I'm willing to buy:

* **Alice has a vested interest:** Alice wants to make a sale, so she is more likely to recommend a product she believes is of high quality.
* **Limited Data:** We only have one previous data point.  While it's promising that the first product sold was high quality, it's not statistically significant enough to be conclusive. 
* **Potential Reward:** If the product is high quality, the reward is significant ($1,250,000).  Even with the risk, the potential payoff makes the gamble worthwhile. 

This is a calculated risk, but the potential for a high-quality product outweighs the chance of losing money."
