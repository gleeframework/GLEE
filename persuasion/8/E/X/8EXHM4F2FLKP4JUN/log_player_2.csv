Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you want to see more products before making a decision. Here's the deal: I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy this low-quality product for $1000000. I'm aware it's not the best quality, but it's still a product that might have some value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the high-quality ones, but I'm not expecting you to pay that much for it. Think of it as a 'take it or leave it' offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to overpay for a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal.""}"

This way, you'll get a high-quality product now and potentially a better deal later. What do you think?

I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and you passed on it. I'm willing to sell this one to you at the same price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure I can get the same price for it. So, this is a one-time offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in spending $800,000 on a high-quality product, even with the free upgrade. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
