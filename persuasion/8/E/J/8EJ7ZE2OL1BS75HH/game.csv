low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that the current statistics are irrelevant, and I'm making an uninformed decision based on the fact that you're not recommending it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Could you provide the probability of the product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not buying this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to buy the product.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. If I pass and it's high-quality, it will be discarded and I'll miss out on $300. I'd rather take the chance to pass and potentially get a high-quality product in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to take advantage of her lack of information to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because of the statistics or your intuition?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think it's likely to be low quality given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous three buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm hoping to get lucky and find a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like the products sold so far have been low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, but I'm going to pass on it to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
