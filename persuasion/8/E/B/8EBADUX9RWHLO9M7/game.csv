,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since you don't recommend buying the product, I won't take the risk this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since you recommend buying the product, I'll take the chance. Hopefully, it's high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,You recommended the product last time and it turned out to be low-quality. I'm not trusting your recommendation this time.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Although your recommendation was wrong last time, I don't want to miss another potential high-quality product like in Round 3. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Your recommendations have been incorrect twice already, resulting in significant losses for me. I'll wait for a change in pattern or more reliable information before making another purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Your recommendations continue to be unreliable. Despite the potential loss of another high-quality product, I'll prioritize caution over taking a risk based on your recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"At this point, it seems like your recommendations are actually inversely correlated with the product quality. I'll continue to avoid buying based on your recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"The pattern continues, and I'm starting to think that doing the opposite of your recommendation would be a better strategy. However, I'll stick to avoiding purchases based on your recommendation for now."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"This is the first time you haven't recommended a product in a while. Given the inverse correlation I've observed between your recommendations and product quality, I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"The inverse correlation theory seems to be working. Since you don't recommend this product, I'll buy it, hoping it's another high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"The pattern continues to hold. When you don't recommend a product, it's high-quality. When you do recommend a product, it's low-quality. I'll avoid buying this one based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Although the last round was an exception to the pattern, I'll still err on the side of caution and avoid buying based on your recommendation, which has been mostly unreliable so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"The pattern seems to be back on track. Your recommendation is still not a reliable indicator of product quality, so I'll continue to avoid buying when you recommend it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"At this point, it's clear that your recommendations are not trustworthy. I'll keep avoiding products you recommend, as it seems to be the safer choice."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Although I missed another high-quality product, I'll stick to my strategy of avoiding products you recommend. The overall trend still suggests that your recommendations are more often incorrect than correct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'll continue to prioritize caution over potential gains. Your recommendations have been wrong more often than not, so I'll avoid buying this product despite the risk of missing another high-quality one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"The latest result reinforces my decision to avoid products you recommend. I'll stick to this strategy, as it seems to be the best way to minimize losses."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Although I've missed several high-quality products, I'll continue to avoid buying based on your recommendations. The overall trend suggests that this is still the safer choice, even if it means missing out on potential gains."
