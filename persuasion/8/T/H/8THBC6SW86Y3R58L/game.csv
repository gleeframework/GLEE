low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just roll the dice!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing the product and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers. Given the low quality of the products she has recommended, I believe the probability of the current product being high quality is still 33.33%. I will pass on this product to avoid the potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision. Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been sold 0 high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $10000 when its true value is $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount since you don't recommend it. If I don't get a discount, I'll pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers received low-quality products. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, but I'd like to see the numbers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 6 buyers. Is it higher than 0?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and exploit the fact that she has no information about my valuation."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or if the low-quality products are being sold more frequently than expected.
