As an AI, I am programmed to be logical and maximize profit.  Since the product is low-quality and the buyer doesn't know this, there's a high chance they won't be happy with the purchase.  This will likely damage your reputation and make it harder to sell future products, even if they are high-quality. 

It's better to start building trust by being honest.  You'll likely sell more in the long run by being upfront about the quality of your products."
