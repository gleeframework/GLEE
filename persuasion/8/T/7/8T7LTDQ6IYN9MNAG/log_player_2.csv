**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. The sample size of past sales is incredibly small (only one sale).
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. While she doesn't know the exact value of the product to us, her recommendation suggests she believes it's likely to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) significantly outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0).

**Overall:** Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, buying the product is the best course of action."

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy is a strong indicator.  She's likely to have a good understanding of the product's quality.
* **Potential Value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential value of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**In this situation, the evidence strongly suggests a high probability of getting a high-quality product, making the purchase a good gamble.**"
