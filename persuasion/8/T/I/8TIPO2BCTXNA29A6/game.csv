high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what its quality is. Can you tell me the probability that it's high quality based on the fact that you're recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process before making my own decision. Was the product they bought high-quality or low-quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 out of 1 high-quality product was sold, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm not convinced that this is a representative sample size. I'd like to wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. What was their strategy?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics, as only 1 out of 4 buyers purchased the product, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the lucky one and get the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Can you share the statistics on the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/5, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the current product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high given the low number of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, but I'd like to know more about the sales record. Could you provide more information about the previous buyers and their purchases?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the 7 previous buyers who bought the products. How many of them got a high-quality product after buying? How many of them got a low-quality product? And what were their decisions? Did they know the quality of the product before buying it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,17,yes,
