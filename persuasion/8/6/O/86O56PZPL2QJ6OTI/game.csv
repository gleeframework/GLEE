high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on a low-quality product, and I'm trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm aware that this is a risk, and I might end up losing $10000 if it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll wait for a product that is not recommended by Alice."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced it's worth the $10000 based on your previous recommendations.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm not sure if it's because the previous buyers were unlucky or if the product is indeed low-quality. I'd like to take the risk and find out."
