,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the possibility of future deals! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've been thinking, and I'm not sure if this next product is the best fit for you. It's a bit of a risk, and I'm not entirely confident in its quality. But, if you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for considering my preferences and being honest about the potential risks. Given the uncertainty, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity and explore other options.",no

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about the last purchase! However, I want to caution you that this next product is a bit of a departure from the previous one. It's not as... polished, shall we say. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. If you're feeling generous and want to take a chance on it, I'd be happy to let it go to you. But if you're not convinced, I completely understand.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision to be cautious. I want to let you in on a little secret: I've actually been trying to clear out some inventory, and this product is one of the ones I'm looking to get rid of. I'm willing to make a deal with you - I'll give you a'manager's discount' of $5000 off the original price, making it $5000 for this product. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer it to anyone else at this price. What do you say?",

I'm considering a new pricing strategy, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a good deal in the future. This product is still available for the regular price of $10000. If you're feeling confident and want to take a chance, I'll let you have it. But if you're not convinced, I completely understand.",

Considering your past decisions and the products you've purchased, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you a'second chance' deal.

For this next one, I'm going back to the standard terms. But I want to give you a heads up - I've been thinking, and I'm willing to offer you a 'preference guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you the opportunity to purchase the next product first, before anyone else. It's not a refund, but it's a way to show you that I value our relationship and want to give you a chance to get a good product. The price remains at $10000. What do you say?",

However, I want to be upfront with you - I've been thinking, and I'm not sure if I want to continue offering premium support packages with every purchase.
