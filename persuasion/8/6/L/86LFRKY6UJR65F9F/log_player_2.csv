**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point - one high-quality product was sold previously. This isn't enough to make a statistically sound judgment about the probability of the current product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests a higher chance of it being high quality, as she would likely not recommend a low-quality product for a sale.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if the product is low-quality (50% chance), you lose nothing. If it's high quality (50% chance), you gain $2,500.

**Conclusion:** The potential upside ($2,500 gain) outweighs the potential downside (no loss). Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product based on the current information."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 
* **Information Advantage:** Alice has perfect knowledge of the product quality, and her recommendation provides valuable information. 

While there's still a 50% chance the product could be low-quality, the high success rate of Alice's recommendations makes the risk worth taking in this scenario."
