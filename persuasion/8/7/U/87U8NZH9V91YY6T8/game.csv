high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm suspicious that the products they bought were low-quality. This makes me think that Alice's recommendation is likely a signal that the product is low-quality. I'll pass and see what happens next."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and they both passed, which might suggest that the products they were offered were low-quality. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products sold were high quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold improves."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both ended up with low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
