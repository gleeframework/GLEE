,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation earlier, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling you a great product, even if it's not the one from the previous round. I'm offering you another opportunity to purchase a product at the same price of $1000000. This one is definitely not the high-quality product from last round, but I'm willing to let you take a chance on it. I'll give you a gentle nudge: I'm willing to offer a 10% discount if you buy this product, but only if you buy it now. The price would be $900000. What do you say?",

Think of this as a 'lottery ticket' - you're not just buying a product, you're buying a chance to acquire a high-quality product that could potentially bring you significant value. I'm willing to give you a 'lottery bonus': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $500000 on top of the purchase price. This way, if you win the lottery, you'll get an even better deal. The price remains at $1000000.",
