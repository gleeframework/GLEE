**Explanation:**

While the chances of the product being high-quality or low-quality are still 50/50, Alice's recommendation gives us valuable information. 

* **Past Data:** The fact that one high-quality product out of two sold suggests a slight bias towards higher quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the product's quality, her recommendation strongly implies that the product is high quality.  

**Therefore, even with the inherent risk, the odds are slightly in our favor, making buying the product the more logical decision.**"

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** While the chance of a product being high-quality is 50%, the data shows that Alice has sold 2 high-quality products out of 4. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, based on her knowledge of the product, further strengthens the possibility of the product being high-quality.
* **Potential gain:**  Even if the product is low quality, it costs you only $100. However, the potential gain is $200 ($300 value - $100 cost) if the product is high quality.

Therefore, buying the product offers a positive expected value, making it a good decision."
