,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance on a potential high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not confident in buying based on your previous recommendations, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're not recommending it, which might indicate it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the 33.33% chance. I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 4 buyers were all low-quality products and the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the average, and I'm trying to exploit this information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1 for it, since I think it's likely to be low-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased so far and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and considering the previous sales record where 6 buyers have purchased products with no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold and Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, and considering the low quality products are more likely to be sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given this information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 6 buyers were all given low-quality products, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the base 33.33%."
