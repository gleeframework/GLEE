,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics you provided.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the expected 0.8. This suggests that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 0.8. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous two buyers didn't have access to the statistics.
