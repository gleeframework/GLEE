,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $500000. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiations. If you're interested, I can throw in a free inspection report that will confirm its quality.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1800000, but I'd like to negotiate the price further. I'm not interested in the inspection report, as I'm confident in my ability to evaluate the product's quality based on its characteristics.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. Considering the quality of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900000. However, I want to emphasize that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, I can also provide you with some information about the product's specifications and features, which might help you understand its value better.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not interested in paying $900000. I'd be willing to pay up to $1800000 for a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to go above that. I'm also not interested in the product specifications and features, as I'm confident in my ability to evaluate its value based on its quality.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant about the price. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. However, I'm also willing to offer you a 'best-estimate' of its value, which I've obtained from a third-party expert. According to this estimate, the product is worth at least $1200000. If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your final counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000. The third-party estimate is interesting, but I'm not convinced it's accurate. I'm willing to pay up to $1800000 for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm starting to think that you're not willing to sell this product at a price that reflects its true value.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism about the estimate, but I assure you that it's a genuine assessment from a reputable expert. However, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 10% discount on the third-party estimate, which would bring the price down to $1080000. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by your offer. I still think the product is worth more than $1000000, and I'm not willing to pay the full $1080000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000, which is still below the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're still hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000, which is $50000 below the third-party estimate. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about selling this product at a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to walk away and see what other options I have. I'd like to move on to the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not as high-quality as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I think it's a fair price considering its quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you as-is.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm surprised by your sudden change in tone and the drastic reduction in price. Given the original quality of the product, I'm skeptical that it's actually of lower quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that may be worth $2000000 at a price that's only $200000. I'd like to see more information about the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide you with more information about the previous product. However, I'd like to assure you that this new product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to provide you with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product's performance, you can return it for a full refund. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $950000, the same price I offered earlier. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your willingness to provide more information, but I'm not convinced by your claims about the product's quality. A 30-day money-back guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product that may be worth $2000000. I'm willing to pay up to $1800000 for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'd like to see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand you're still hesitant, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for that price, and I'm also willing to throw in a 5-year warranty, which is a significant added value. I think this is a fair price considering the product's quality and the warranty, and I'm willing to make a deal.",

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1800000, which is the maximum price you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you at your ceiling price, and I'm confident that this product is worth it. I'm also willing to throw in a personalized consultation with one of our experts to ensure you get the most out of the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",

,,Alice,10,"Congratulations on making a great decision on the previous product! However, I want to be transparent with you about this new product. As we've established a good relationship, I'm willing to be upfront with you - this product is not as high-quality as the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000, which is a fraction of its original price. I think it's a fair price considering its quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you as-is. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to take advantage of you, and I'm willing to offer you a significant discount because I value our new relationship.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm surprised by your sudden change in tone and the drastic reduction in price. Given the original quality of the product, I'm skeptical that it's actually of lower quality. I'm also concerned that you're trying to take advantage of me now that we've established a good relationship. I'm not willing to pay $50000 for a product that may be worth $2000000.

,,Alice,11,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to take advantage of you. However, I do want to be upfront with you about this new product. I'll provide you with a detailed report on its specifications and features, as well as a certification from a third-party testing facility that verifies its quality. I'll also offer you a 90-day trial period, during which you can return the product for a full refund if you're not satisfied with its performance. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1200000, which is a price that reflects its true value. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to make a deal.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your willingness to provide more information, but I'm not convinced by your claims about the product's quality. A certification from a third-party testing facility is not enough to guarantee its quality, and a 90-day trial period is not a substitute for a lower price. I'm still not willing to pay $1200000 for a product that may be worth $2000000. I'd like to see if you're willing to meet me in the middle or make a more serious offer.",no

I'll also throw in a premium after-sales service package, which includes priority support, regular software updates, and a dedicated account manager. This package is valued at $200000, but I'll include it in the sale price. I'm confident that this product is worth the investment, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your willingness to make a more serious offer, but I'm still not convinced that the price is fair. I'm willing to pay up to $1800000 for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to go above that. The premium after-sales service package is a nice addition, but it's not enough to justify the price. I'd like to see if you're willing to meet me at my ceiling price or make a more serious offer.",no

,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on making another great decision! I'm glad we could finalize the previous deal and I'm excited to offer you another high-quality product. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've already reached my sales target for the day, and I'm willing to let this product go for a significantly discounted price. I'll sell it to you for $800000, which is a 55% discount from the usual price. I think this is a one-time opportunity, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. It's a risk-free investment, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm surprised by your sudden willingness to offer a 55% discount. While I appreciate the offer, I'm not convinced that this is a risk-free investment. I've already bought two high-quality products from you at a significant discount, and I'm starting to think that there may be a pattern here. I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that may be worth $2000000. I'd like to see more information about the product's quality and value before making a decision.",no

I think this is a fair price considering its limitations, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",

Given the pattern of behavior you've exhibited in our previous interactions, I'm starting to think that you're intentionally trying to deceive me.

,,Bob,17,"I'm not buying what you're selling. Despite your claims of transparency and fairness, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality.
