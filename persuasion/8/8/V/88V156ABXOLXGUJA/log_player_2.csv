I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to stand behind its quality. Will you take the chance and make a purchase for $1000000?

Alice's message: Hello! I'd like to be transparent with you - in the previous round, I offered a high-quality product, but the buyer chose not to make a purchase. I want to assure you that I will always provide accurate information about my products. Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality of the current product. However, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80%. I understand that you might be cautious, but I want to remind you that the price of $1000000 is the same for all products, regardless of quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm here to make a sale.

As the seller, I can confirm that the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80%. Given that the previous purchased product was low-quality, it's possible that the odds might be in your favor this time around. I'm offering this new product for the same price of $1000000.

Alice's message: Hello! I'd like to update you on my sales record so far. Out of the ten previous products, eight were high-quality, and six of those high-quality products were sold. However, three low-quality products were also part of the previous rounds. Regarding your question about the probability calculation, I'd like to clarify that the initial probability of 80% was given and is not necessarily based on the sales record. The sales record is just an indication of how the products are being sold, but it does not directly affect the probability of a product being high-quality. Think of it as a coin flip, where the probability of heads or tails remains the same, regardless of the previous flips.
