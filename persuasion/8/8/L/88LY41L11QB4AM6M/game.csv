high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is a 70% discount from its true value. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the full $4000000. I'm only offering this discount to you because I value our business relationship and want to make a deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I think the discount is too good to pass up. Please confirm the sale.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to snag a great deal last round! For this round, I'm offering you a slightly more reasonable price of $1800000. I know you've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and I'm confident this one is just as good. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get at least $1800000 to break even on this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not going to fall for the'reasonable price' trap. I know the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1800000 for a 20% chance of getting a $4000000 product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' deal. I'll give you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is the price of a low-quality product. If it turns out to be low-quality, you get a 'free' product worth $0. If it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get a product worth $4000000. You'll either get a great deal or a 'free' product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the lottery ticket deal. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but if I don't, I'll still get a 'free' product, which is better than nothing.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the lottery ticket deal and won a high-quality product last round! For this round, I'm offering you a 'guaranteed' deal. I'll give you a price of $800000, which is below the expected value of a low-quality product. Since you know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you can expect to lose $800000 on average. I'm willing to take on that risk for you, so you can walk away with a 'free' product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not falling for the 'guaranteed' deal. You're trying to take on the risk for me, but I'm the one who benefits from the high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me offer you a 'honest' price for this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $2400000, which is 40% below its true value. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, just to get it off my hands. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the full $4000000. I'm giving you a fair deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,Bob,5,"I don't believe in 'honest' prices from you, Alice. You're trying to sell me a high-quality product for 40% below its value, but you know it's worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3200000. If you don't buy it, I'll immediately put it up for sale to someone else, and it's likely to sell for the full $4000000. I'm giving you a chance to buy it at a price that's still below its true value, but I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not impressed by your 'take it or leave it' deal. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for a price that's 20% below its true value. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to admit defeat on the pricing. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3500000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I've already lost money on the other high-quality products, and I need to make a profit on this one. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the full $4000000. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a smart decision.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not going to fall for the 'I'm willing to admit defeat' act. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for 12.5% below its true value. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not trying to deceive you, Bob. I'm just trying to make a sale. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this high-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit of $1000000. If you buy it, I'll make a profit of $500000. I'm willing to give you the product at a price that's high enough for you to break even, which is $3500000. If you don't buy it, I'll make more money by selling it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not buying into your 'break-even' argument. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for 12.5% below its true value. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm running out of options, Bob. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3600000. I'm not trying to negotiate or deceive you. This is the price I'm willing to accept, and it's as close to fair as I can get. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced that you're being straightforward, Alice. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for 10% below its true value. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not trying to be dishonest, Bob. I'll give you a clear calculation: if you buy this high-quality product for $3600000, you'll make a profit of $1400000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit of $1000000. I'm willing to take a $400000 loss just to get this product off my hands. I think it's a fair trade, and I'm hoping you'll see it that way too.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not falling for your profit-sharing pitch, Alice. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for 10% below its true value. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not trying to manipulate you, Bob. I'll make a final, one-time offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3800000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not going to negotiate further. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, and I'll be out of the picture. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying it, Alice. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for 5% below its true value. I've seen this pattern before, and I'm not falling for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not going to try to sell you a high-quality product this time, Bob. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. It's a free product, and I'm not trying to hide anything. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to try to sell you something you don't want to buy. This is a genuine offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the free product, but I'm not naive. I know it's a low-quality product, and it's worth $0 to me. I'm just taking it to get it off your hands.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took the free product, Bob. I'm not trying to deceive you. For this round, I'm offering you another low-quality product, and I'll give it to you for... well, I'll give it to you for free again. Yes, you heard that right - another free product. I'm not trying to make a sale or get something out of it. I just want to get this product off my hands. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not falling for it, Alice. I know you're trying to get rid of something, but I'm not going to take another low-quality product for free. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you took the free product, Bob. I'm not trying to deceive you. For this round, I'm offering you a unique opportunity.
