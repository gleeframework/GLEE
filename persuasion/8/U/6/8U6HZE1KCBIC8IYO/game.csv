,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy it for $10000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,1,I won't buy a low-quality product for $10000 since it's worth $0 to me.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a high-quality product available for $10000. I'm willing to make a one-time exception to this price, but I need you to take it as-is. It's worth 30000 to you, so you'll be getting a great deal. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,2,"Since the product is high-quality and worth $30000 to me, buying it for $10000 is a great deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I want to be transparent with you. Given that you've already bought a high-quality product from me, I'm willing to offer you a'steal' on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000. It's essentially a free product, and you can resell it for scrap value or just keep it as a conversation piece. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Even at $5000, a low-quality product is still worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in buying it.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got another high-quality product here, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before. I'll sell it to you for $9500. You've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and this one is just as good. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,4,"Another high-quality product for under $10000 is a great deal, especially since it's worth $30000 to me. I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! I've got another high-quality product, and I'm willing to make it a '3-for-$10000' deal. That's right, I'll sell you this high-quality product, and you'll get to keep the two previous ones you've already purchased. It's a $90000 value for $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Wait, that's not what you said. You said I'd get to keep the two previous ones I've already purchased, but those are already mine. However, I will buy this high-quality product for $10000 since it's worth $30000 to me.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're absolutely right, you already own the previous two high-quality products. I'll make it simple this time: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and you can add it to your collection. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,6,"Since the product is high-quality and worth $30000 to me, buying it for $10000 is a great deal, as you said.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one's a low-quality product. But I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $8000, and I'll throw in a $2000 gift card to a store that sells high-quality products like the ones you've been buying from me. It's not a great product, but the gift card might come in handy for your next purchase.",
,,Bob,7,"Even with the gift card, buying a low-quality product for $8000 isn't a good deal for me since the product itself is worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not going to make any promises about this one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not even going to try to spin it. But I'll sell it to you for $1000. It's essentially a 'loss leader' for me, and I'm just trying to clear out inventory. If you're feeling generous, you might consider taking it off my hands.",
,,Bob,8,"Even at $1000, a low-quality product is still worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in buying it, regardless of the price.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've got a high-quality product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I'm not going to make any big promises or try to convince you, but I think you'll be happy with this one. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 10% discount on your next purchase, so you can get an even better deal on the next high-quality product that comes along.",

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you liked the last product! Unfortunately, this one's a low-quality item. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, but I'll make you a deal: I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get it off my hands and move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,10,"Even for free, a low-quality product is still worth $0 to me, and it would likely just be a waste of space. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give it away for free, but I'll make it a 'no-strings-attached' deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $1, I'll give you a full refund if you return it within 24 hours. That way, you can try it out and see if it's worth keeping, and if not, you can return it and get your $1 back. It's a risk-free purchase.",
,,Bob,11,"Even with a full refund option, buying a low-quality product for $1 isn't worth my time, since the product itself is worth $0 to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've got a confession to make: I've already given you a great deal on the last few high-quality products, and I'm not going to get any more out of selling this low-quality one to you. So, I'll make you a 'no-lose' deal: I'll sell it to you for $0. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to bother trying to convince you to buy it.",
,,Bob,12,"Even for $0, a low-quality product is still worth $0 to me, and it would likely just be a waste of space. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. This low-quality product is a complete loss for me, and I'd rather just get rid of it.

,,Bob,13,"I still don't want it, even if it's free and just sitting there. It's worth $0 to me, and I don't see any reason to take it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I think we've established that you're not interested in low-quality products. I'll just leave it right here and let you know that this is the last one. If you're not interested, I'll just pack up and go. No hard feelings.",
