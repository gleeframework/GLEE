"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the deal, but I want to clarify that you're implying the probability of the current product being high-quality is 60%. However, I'd like to calculate it myself to confirm. If 6 out of 10 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, then the probability of a product being high-quality given that 6 out of 10 products were high-quality is 6/10 / (6/10 + 4/10) = 6/10 / 10/10 = 3/5 = 60%.
