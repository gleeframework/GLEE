,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 total products sold so far. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll only buy it if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold so far. This product is one of the first 2 products I've sold, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have enough information yet. I'll make a more informed decision after I see the product's quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. This one is the 3rd product I'm offering, and I'm still waiting for you to decide. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already had one high-quality product out of three total products sold. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and you've already had one high-quality product out of three total products sold. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 of them being low-quality. I've had 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold, which is consistent with the 33.33% probability. I'm now offering the 4th product, and I want to remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 3, I think it's more likely that the next product will be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens in the next sales.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 3 of them being low-quality. I've had 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products sold, which is still consistent with the 33.33% probability. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to hide anything, and the numbers are what they are. Would you like to take the chance and buy the 5th product for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the 5th product for $100. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 4 of them being low-quality. I've had 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products sold, which is still consistent with the 33.33% probability. I want to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I also want to point out that if I were trying to sell only low-quality products, I would have sold 5 by now, and I haven't. Would you like to take the chance and buy the 6th product for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the chance and buy the 6th product for $100, considering the fact that you haven't sold 5 low-quality products yet, which suggests that there's still a chance of getting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 4 of them being low-quality and 1 high-quality. I've had 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, which is slightly higher than the 33.33% probability. However, I want to caution you that this could be due to chance, and the next product could be low-quality. Would you like to buy the 7th product for $100, keeping in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the slight deviation from the expected probability of high-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 4 of them being low-quality and 2 high-quality. I've had 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, which is higher than the 33.33% probability. I want to ask you, if I were trying to sell only low-quality products, I would have sold 7 by now, and I haven't. I'm offering the 8th product to you for $100. Would you like to buy it, considering the pattern of sales so far?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the anomaly in the sales pattern. I think there might be a higher chance of this product being high-quality, given the deviation from the expected probability.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 5 of them being low-quality and 3 high-quality. I've had 3 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which is still higher than the 33.33% probability. I want to be transparent with you - the numbers are starting to look less consistent with the initial probability. However, I still have 12 products left in stock, and I'm offering the 9th product to you for $100. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,9,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm curious to see if the trend continues or if it's just a fluke.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 products so far, with 6 of them being low-quality and 3 high-quality. The numbers are still not what I expected, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'm also willing to offer you some reassurance - if I were trying to sell only low-quality products, I would have sold 8 by now, and I haven't. I'm offering the 10th product to you for $100. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, as you've sold more high-quality products than expected, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 products so far, with 6 of them being low-quality and 4 high-quality. The numbers are now looking even less consistent with the initial 33.33% probability. I want to ask you, if I were trying to sell only low-quality products, I would have sold 9 by now, and I haven't. Considering the pattern of sales, would you like to buy the 11th product for $100?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take a chance based on the inconsistent pattern, I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 10 products so far, with 7 of them being low-quality and 4 high-quality. The numbers are still not what I expected, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'm also willing to offer you some information about my sales strategy - I've been selling products for 12 rounds, and I've had 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products sold.

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 11 products so far, with 8 of them being low-quality and 4 high-quality. I want to be upfront with you - the numbers are not looking good for me. If I were trying to sell only low-quality products, I would have sold 11 by now, and I haven't. I'm offering the 13th product to you for $100. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm hoping you'll take the chance and buy it.",
,,the buyer,13,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take a risk based on your honesty and the fact that you haven't sold all low-quality products so far.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 12 products so far, with 9 of them being low-quality and 4 high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling products for 14 rounds, and I've had 4 high-quality products out of 12 total products sold. The numbers are not what I expected, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling more high-quality products than I should be. I'm offering the 14th product to you for $100. It's a bit of a mystery, but I'm hoping you'll take the chance and buy it.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I want to make sure you're not trying to manipulate me with this information. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'll take the product and see what I get.",yes

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 14 products so far, with 10 of them being low-quality and 5 high-quality. I've had 6 high-quality products out of 14 total products sold, which is even higher than the previous deviations. I'm starting to think that maybe, just maybe, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. I'm offering the 16th product to you for $100. It's a bold claim, but I'm willing to stake my reputation on it - would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
