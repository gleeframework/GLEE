**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:**  Since there was one sale and it was a high-quality product, the probability of the current product also being high quality is higher than the initial 80% chance. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation provides additional positive information, suggesting she believes this product is high quality.
* **Potential gain outweighs risk:**  Even though there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential $200 gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality one."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (5 out of 9). This suggests Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a significant factor. Since she has information about the product's quality, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.

**Overall:**  The combination of Alice's recommendation and the strong sales record makes buying the product a reasonable gamble."
