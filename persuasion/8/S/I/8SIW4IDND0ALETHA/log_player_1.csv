  ""message"": ""I see you're a bold one! Since the previous product was low-quality, I'd like to clarify that I'm not obligated to refund you. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' for this product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund. This way, you'll only lose $500,000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. What do you say?""
}"

This product would normally be worth $1,200,000, but I'll sell it to you for $300,000. This way, you can minimize your potential loss. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'd be taking a significant risk by buying it, even at 75% off. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.
