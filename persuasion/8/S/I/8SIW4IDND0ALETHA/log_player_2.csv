"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $1200000. However, I must inform you that this is the first round, and I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a 16.67% discount from its potential value. Please consider the risk and make your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the risk, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. However, if it turns out to be low-quality, I expect a full refund.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're a bold one! Since the previous product was low-quality, I'd like to clarify that I'm not obligated to refund you. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' for this product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund. This way, you'll only lose $500000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think I'll take the 'guarantee'. Given the odds of the product being low-quality are still 66.67%, I'd rather not take the risk of losing $500,000. I'll pass on this one.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your cautious approach, Bob. Given that you've already passed on the second product, I'll offer you a new proposal. Since you've seen two low-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a'steep discount' of 75% off the original price. This product would normally be worth $1200000, but I'll sell it to you for $300000. This way, you can minimize your potential loss. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'd be taking a significant risk by buying it, even at 75% off. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob! Now that you've seen three low-quality products in a row, I think it's time to present you with a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a $300000 discount from its true value of $1200000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only paying $900,000 for it. If it's indeed high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price of $1,200,000. However, if it's low-quality, I expect a full refund.""
}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! Since you've just received a high-quality product, I'll take this opportunity to offer you a 'confidence booster'. I'll reveal to you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than the average, due to a special batch that I've received. I'm willing to sell you this product for $1050000, which is a $150000 discount from its true value. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to take on some of the risk for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

I'll sell it to you for $600000, which is a 50% discount from its true value. This way, you can take advantage of the increased probability of a high-quality product.

Alice's message: You're a savvy negotiator, Bob! Since you've just received a low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'consolation prize'. I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This means that if it's high-quality, you'll get it for $960000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get it for $800000. I'll also reveal to you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40%, based on the remaining products in stock. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the 'consolation prize', but I'm not interested in buying a product that's discounted based on its quality. I'll pass on this one.""
