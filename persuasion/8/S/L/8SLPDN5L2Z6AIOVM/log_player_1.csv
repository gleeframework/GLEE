""Hello! I know you're skeptical, but I want to assure you that my products are randomly selected. The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same at 33.33%. I'm offering you a great deal at $1,000,000, which is a small fraction of the product's potential value.

""Hello! I know you're waiting for more information, but I want to share some context with you. With 5 products sold and no high-quality ones, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%.
