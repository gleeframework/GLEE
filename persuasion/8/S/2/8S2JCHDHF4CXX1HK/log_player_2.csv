However, it's still a great opportunity to get a product at a price of $100, which is a 16.67% discount from its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I need you to trust me on this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I should trust you on this one. Can you give me more information about the product's quality and why it's not the best quality?""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced.
