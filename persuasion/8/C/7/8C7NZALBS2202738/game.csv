,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 2 failed high-quality products sold, I'm starting to think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'm going to pass on the product. I think the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since the odds of it being high quality are still 33.33% and I know Alice has no incentive to recommend low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a 10% discount, considering the product's low quality and the fact that you've already recommended against it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This increases my suspicion that the current product might also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality. This suggests a high likelihood that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that all previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendations, it's likely that the products were all low-quality, which would mean the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 5 products so far, and none of them were high quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or get more information before making a decision."
