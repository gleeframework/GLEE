low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product if you buy from me. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,1,Thank you for the opportunity. I understand the risk involved. Let's see if we're lucky today!,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. You now have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product if you buy from me. However, I'd like to point out that the last product sold was indeed high-quality, which might suggest that I've been selling more high-quality products than low-quality ones. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and your recent sale of a high-quality product, I believe the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than the overall 50% chance. I am willing to take this risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. Given the recent trend, you might think I'm selling more high-quality products than low-quality ones. However, keep in mind that this could be just a coincidence. I want to assure you that I'm not manipulating the sales to deceive you. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. Based on the information provided and the positive trend, I am willing to purchase the current product for $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products. The trend is clear, and I'm starting to think that my initial 50% chance of selling a high-quality product might be an underestimate. However, I want to caution you that past results don't necessarily predict future outcomes. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics you've shared, it seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be higher than initially thought. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products. The streak of high-quality products might be coming to an end. I want to remind you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and past results don't necessarily reflect the true probability. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, but I do want to caution you that this product might not be as valuable as the previous ones. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your transparency, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product. I appreciate your honesty.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products. The trend is still looking strong, but I want to remind you that the law of large numbers is at play here. With a larger sample size, the results should start to converge towards the true probability. Keep in mind that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not trying to influence your decision. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products. The streak of high-quality products has ended, and I want to be upfront with you - the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not trying to hide the fact that I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones so far. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Based on the information provided, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 8 total products. It seems that my previous admission of a lower probability of selling high-quality products was premature. I want to caution you that this is still just a single data point, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'm willing to admit that my recent sales record is starting to suggest a higher probability of high-quality products. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",

It's clear that my recent sales record is indicating a higher probability of high-quality products. I want to be upfront with you - I'm starting to think that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. However, I still can't guarantee it, and the overall probability remains 50%. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given your recent sales record and the uncertainty, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and 3 low-quality products. It's clear that my recent sales record was a anomaly, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50%. I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling more low-quality products than I initially expected, and I'm not sure what to expect from the next product. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",

,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products, and 5 low-quality products. The numbers are starting to look more balanced, and I'm not sure if I've been selling more low-quality products due to chance or if the initial 50% probability is actually accurate. I want to be upfront with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not trying to influence your decision. If you buy, you'll pay $100, and you'll know the quality of the product afterwards.",
