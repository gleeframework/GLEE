Alice's message: I'm excited to introduce you to our latest product! With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, the chances are that this one might be a gem. But, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few buyers who weren't satisfied with their purchase in the past. Would you like to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your concern! Unfortunately, I can't disclose the specific details of previous buyers, but I can tell you that all the buyers who didn't purchase the product ended up not getting a high-quality one. I'm confident that this product is just as good as the ones that didn't sell. Would you like to take a chance and get this one for $10000?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put it this way: out of the 2 products that didn't sell, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. The buyer who got the low-quality product didn't get a refund, but they did get a valuable lesson in the importance of due diligence. Would you like to learn from their experience and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the current product, but I want to clarify that I'm doing so based on the fact that the first low-quality product didn't sell, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'm taking a calculated risk, but I'm willing to take it.""

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're willing to take a calculated risk. As for this new product, I'd like to remind you that the previous buyer's decision was based on incomplete information. Just because this product didn't sell, it doesn't necessarily mean it's high-quality. In fact, it's just as likely to be low-quality as the previous one.
