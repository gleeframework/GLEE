Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to be the first buyer and I'll take the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous data:**  There is no information about the seller's past performance, so we can't rely on that to make a decision.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While she knows the quality, we don't know if she's being truthful or trying to sell a low-quality product. 
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is 0.8 * $120 + 0.2 * $0 = $96. This is less than the price, but since there's no information to go on, it's a gamble worth taking. 

**Important Note:**  This decision is based purely on the information provided and the expected value calculation. In a real-world scenario, we'd be much more cautious with limited information about the seller."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which carries weight, as she knows the true quality. 
* **Statistics:** Although the data is limited, 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong signal, even with a small sample size.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of $0. It's a good gamble based on the available information."
