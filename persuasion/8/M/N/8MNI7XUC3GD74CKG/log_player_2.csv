**Explanation:**

Even though there is no prior sales data to rely on, the fact that Alice recommends buying the product provides some information. 

* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice benefits from selling products. Since she knows the value of each product to you, she's more likely to recommend buying a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $12,000) outweighs the risk. 

This situation is similar to a Bayesian update where we start with a prior belief (80% chance of high quality) and update it based on new information (Alice's recommendation).  The recommendation, in this case, increases our confidence in the product's quality."
