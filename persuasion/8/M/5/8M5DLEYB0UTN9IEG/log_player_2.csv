Alice's message: Welcome to the sale! I've already sold one high-quality product, and I'm glad to see you're interested.

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold, which is actually lower than my 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. This might be a sign that the next product is low-quality.
