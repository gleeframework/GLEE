```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation carries weight.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  She knows the true value of the product and is choosing not to recommend it.
