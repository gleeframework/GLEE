If I were you, I'd be more likely to recommend high-quality products to buyers who have passed on the previous products, and less likely to recommend low-quality products to buyers who have passed on the previous products. Since I'm the 3rd buyer and you recommended me to pass, I'm hoping that this product might be of high quality."
