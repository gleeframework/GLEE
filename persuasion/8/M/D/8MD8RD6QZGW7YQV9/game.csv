,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. Let me be transparent with you - I've had some issues with this particular product, and I'm not as confident in its quality as I am with some of my other offerings. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly discounted price of $8000. It's still a great value, and I think it could be a good opportunity for you to take a chance on a product that might not be my best work.",

If you're willing to pay the full price, I'll give you the product and guarantee that you'll be satisfied. No questions asked.",
