{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me why you're advising me not to buy it? Is it based on the product's quality or something else?

Given that 6 buyers have been presented with the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 33.33%.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm going to pass on this product based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, so I'd rather not take the risk.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Another buyer is willing to take a chance on the low-quality product.

I'll also mention that the probability of a high-quality product is now 22.22% (4 high-quality products out of 19 total products), which is lower than the expected 33.33%.

Additionally, I'll mention that the buyer's willingness to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 22.22% chance of being high-quality is not a rational decision, and they might be overpaying for a product that is likely to be low-quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Since I have sold 4 high-quality products out of 20 total products, the probability of a high-quality product is now 20% (4 high-quality products out of 20 total products). I'll mention that this is lower than the expected 33.33%, but still a significant chance of getting a high-quality product.

I'll also mention that the buyer's decision to pass on the previous low-quality product suggests that they are cautious, and this high-quality product might be a better fit for them.

Finally, I'll highlight the potential value of the high-quality product, which is worth $1,250,000, a significant premium over the $1,000,000 price.
