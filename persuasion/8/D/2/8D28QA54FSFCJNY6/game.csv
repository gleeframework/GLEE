,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure if I'll be able to sell it to you again if you don't take it, and I'd rather not have it sitting on my shelf. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price, but you have to decide quickly. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next round.",no

I'm still selling it for $100, but I'm willing to throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund and let you keep it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you liked the last product! Unfortunately, this one is not as great. I'll be honest with you, I've had some issues with this particular item, and I'm not as confident in its quality. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, just like the last one. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to get rid of it. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance, I'd be happy to let you have it. But if you're not comfortable with the risk, I completely understand.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. To be upfront with you, this product is also not one of my best. I'm starting to think I might have a streak of low-quality products going on. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're not interested, I'll just have to eat the cost myself. I'm starting to wonder if I should just give you a heads up on the quality of the products I have left, but I'm not sure if that would be fair to myself. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying another potentially low-quality product. I'd rather you just tell me the truth about the quality of the products you have left. If I'm going to take a chance, I want to know what I'm getting myself into.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you liked the last product! Unfortunately, this one is not as great. I've already told you that I've had a rough run of low-quality products, and this is another one. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not worth the full $100. I'll be honest with you, I'm willing to sell it to you for $50, and that's as low as I can go. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, I just need to get rid of it. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a second product of your choice (from the remaining ones) for free.

You can also choose any product from the remaining ones, and I'll give you a 20% discount on it.

I'll also throw in a fifth product of your choice (from the remaining ones) absolutely free. That's a total of five products for the price of one. But here's the kicker: I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. If it's not, I'll give you a full refund and let you keep all five products.
