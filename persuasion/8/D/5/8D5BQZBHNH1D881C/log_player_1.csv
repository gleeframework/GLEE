``` 

While you haven't sold anything yet, this is the first time you're recommending a product. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, so recommending a product suggests you believe this one is high quality.  This is a good opportunity to try and build trust."

The buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. There's no benefit to recommending a low-quality product in this scenario."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront, but without any prior sales data, I'm not comfortable taking the risk on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'll pass for now.

There is no information that suggests you know more about the product than they do."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. Since there's no historical data to suggest a higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product, I'll pass on this one.  Perhaps I'll reconsider if the sales record changes.
