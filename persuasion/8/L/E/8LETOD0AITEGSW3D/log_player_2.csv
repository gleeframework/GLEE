**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  You only have one data point - one high-quality product sold out of a very small sample size. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product. While she doesn't know your personal valuation, this suggests she has some confidence in the product's quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant compared to the potential loss ($0). 

**Strategy:** Even though the odds are against you, the potential reward makes buying a worthwhile gamble, especially considering Alice's recommendation."
