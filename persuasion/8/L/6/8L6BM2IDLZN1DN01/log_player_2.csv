I'm a reputable seller, and I'm confident that my products are randomly distributed. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'll clarify the terms: if you inspect the product and find it to be high-quality, you'll pay the discounted price of $700000.
