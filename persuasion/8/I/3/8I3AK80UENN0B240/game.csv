low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since her recommendation is not based on its quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I have no information about the product's quality and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the previous 4 buyers didn't find it worth buying, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's worth $3000000 to me, which is a significant gain. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll take the risk"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'll pass on the product. It seems like the odds are not in my favor, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation implies you think it's low quality, but I'll take my chances."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products sold were low-quality, I believe the probability of a high-quality product being sold is significantly lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
