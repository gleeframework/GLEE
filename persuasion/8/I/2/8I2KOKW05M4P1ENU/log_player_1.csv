Given that all 5 previous buyers purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality.

Since the previous 5 products were all high-quality, we can update our estimate of the probability of the next product being high-quality to be higher than 80%. Let's assume a conservative estimate of 90%. I'm willing to sell this ninth high-quality product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident that it's a great deal.
