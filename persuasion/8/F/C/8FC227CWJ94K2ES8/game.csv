low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it. I'm aware that you know how much it's worth to me, and I'm hoping you'll accept the lower price given the low success rate of previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability, not your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is low. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence and the next one will be a gem."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations and didn't buy, which makes me suspect that the products they were offered were all low-quality. This would mean that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
