,,Alice,1,"I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it for a fixed price of $1000000. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality after the purchase. Please let me know if you're interested.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, thank you!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Since you bought the first one, I'll give you a hint about the current product. I've sold you a low-quality product for $1000000, and you might be wondering if it's worth it. I'm willing to sell the next product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this one and it's also low-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $500000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the gamble and buy the product, thanks for the guarantee!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! You've bought two low-quality products for $1000000 each. I'm starting to think you're not interested in the guarantee I offered last time. Let me try something different. I'll give you a new offer: I'll sell you this product for $750000, but if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $500000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the new offer and buy the product, thanks for the discount!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're really taking advantage of the discounts, aren't you? Okay, let's try something different. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this one and it's high-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $1000000. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $1000000. Either way, you get a great deal! What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the guarantee and buy the product, thanks for the offer!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've got a high-quality product this time! I'm glad you took the guarantee. Now, let's try something a bit different. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy this one and it's high-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $1500000. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll sell you the next one for $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the reverse guarantee and buy the product, thanks for the offer!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've got another low-quality product! I'm starting to think you're not interested in the guarantees anymore. Let me try something simple. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a hint: I've sold you two high-quality products in the past, and two low-quality products. What do you think the probability is that this product is high-quality?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the hint and buy the product, I'm not sure what the probability is, but I'll take a chance!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll! You've bought three low-quality products and two high-quality products. Let me give you a new perspective. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll tell you that I've already sold you two high-quality products. If you buy this one and it's high-quality, you'll have bought three high-quality products out of five. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, you'll have bought three low-quality products out of five. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the new perspective and buy the product, I'm not sure what the probability is, but I'll take a chance!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've bought three low-quality products and two high-quality products. Let me try something different. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll make a prediction: I think you're going to buy this product. If I'm right, I'll sell you the next one for $750000. If I'm wrong, I'll sell you the next one for $1500000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the challenge and buy the product, I'm curious to see what happens!",yes

I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: if you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product, and we'll start fresh with the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the last chance and buy the product, I'm not sure if I'll get a refund, but I'll take the risk!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're taking a risk, I like that! Unfortunately, you've bought five low-quality products and two high-quality products. I'm going to give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000 if you're willing to negotiate. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the straightforward offer and buy the product, but I'll also mention that I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle at $750000!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a shrewd negotiator! I like that. Okay, we meet in the middle at $750000. You've bought six low-quality products and two high-quality products. Let me try to mix things up. I'll sell you this product for $750000, but I'll give you a'steal' offer: if you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll throw in a'mystery prize' with the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the steal offer and buy the product, I'm curious about the mystery prize!",yes

I'll give you a 'final warning': I'll sell you this product for $750000, but if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll reveal the mystery prize, and you'll have to decide whether it's worth the price. If you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' for the next product, which means you'll get it for 50% off. What do you think?",

I'll give you a 'last stand' offer: I'll sell you this product for $750000, but if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll reveal the mystery prize, and you'll have to decide whether it's worth the price. If you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you the golden ticket, and you'll get the next product for 50% off. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 'price match' guarantee. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll match the price of the next product, so you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the last stand offer and buy the product, I'm intrigued by the price match guarantee!",yes
