**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have information about one previous buyer, and they bought a high-quality product. This is very encouraging, but it's still a small sample size.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is significant. While she doesn't know our individual valuation, she has likely seen something that makes her confident in the product's quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain ($12,000) is much higher than the potential loss ($0). Even with a 50% chance of it being low quality, the expected value of buying is positive.

**Overall:** Based on the limited information, the potential reward outweighs the risk, and Alice's recommendation adds further confidence."
