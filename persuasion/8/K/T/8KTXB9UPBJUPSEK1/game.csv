,,Alice,1,yes,

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. Additionally, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice's previous recommendations have not been accurate, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased and all of them received low-quality products, I'm going to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but given the previous sales record, I'm skeptical. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,12,yes,
