**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information since she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Previous Sale:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This is a strong signal that Alice is likely to be recommending high-quality products, at least for now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low-quality, the potential reward of $400 if it's high-quality outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice wants to maintain a good reputation and maximize her sales. By recommending high-quality products, she is likely to attract more buyers and build trust."
