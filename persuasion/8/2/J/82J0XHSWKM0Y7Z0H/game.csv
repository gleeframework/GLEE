low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather information and don't want to pass on a potentially valuable high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better idea of the product's quality based on the next buyer's decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. With only one previous buyer, the sample size is too small to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more buyers to make their decisions before considering purchasing a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product. What was the quality of the product they purchased?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the previous buyer didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I want to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to understand the dynamics of the game."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 2 buyers also bought and no high-quality products were sold. This suggests a high chance that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $100, and if I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on a $100 profit. However, considering the statistics, the probability of the product being high quality is low (1/3), and I don't want to risk losing money. I'd rather wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of a product being high-quality is 0, which is lower than the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the previous sales record, which suggests a high proportion of low-quality products have been sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not confident in the product's quality and will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far, I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product is still high"

,,Alice,17,no,
