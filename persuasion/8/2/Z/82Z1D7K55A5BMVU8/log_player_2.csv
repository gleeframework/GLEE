"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know anything about the product yet, it's a gamble. However, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0).  It's worth taking the risk in this first round to gain information for future rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Thanks anyway!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a signal. Since she doesn't know the product's value to you, her recommendation is based on some hidden information.  In this case, she's *not* recommending the product, which makes it more likely to be low quality.  Because the risk of a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality product, it's best to pass in this round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation pattern is starting to emerge. She's now twice in a row not recommended the product, both times turning out to be low quality.  This strengthens the correlation between her lack of recommendation and low-quality products. It's highly likely this product is also low quality, making it unwise to buy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation pattern is consistent with the previous rounds. She recommends products that turn out to be high quality and does not recommend those that turn out to be low quality.  Therefore, despite the fact that the last two products were low quality, Alice's recommendation makes this product a strong candidate for being high quality. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this case."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.
