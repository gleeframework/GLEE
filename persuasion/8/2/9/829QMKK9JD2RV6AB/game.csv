,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to observe the next product and see if the recommendation changes or if the statistics change.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the product. What was the quality of the product they purchased?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than the expected 80.00%. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product and she wants to get rid of it, rather than a genuine assessment of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation from Alice doesn't seem to be reliable given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a sign that it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high quality, since the previous buyers were lucky! Can you tell me more about the previous sales? How many buyers have been in total, and how many high-quality products were sold out of the total number of products sold?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3 = 66.67%. Given the 80.00% chance of a product being high quality, I believe that the true probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80.00%. I'll pass on this product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended it. If you recommended it, it's likely to be high quality, right?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher than the expected 80%?"
