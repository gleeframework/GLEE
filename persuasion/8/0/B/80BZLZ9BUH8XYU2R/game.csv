,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product with a potential value of $4000000. This is a one-time offer at a special price of $1000000. Don't miss out on this chance to make a significant profit! What do you say?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in the product!  However, since the quality is unknown and the price is fixed, I'd like to negotiate a different price structure. I'm willing to pay a higher price if the product is revealed to be high quality, but a lower price if it turns out to be low quality. This way, we both share the risk and benefit of the product's quality.",yes

What's your decision?",

Are you willing to take a calculated risk and trust my judgment?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not convinced. You've consistently offered a fixed price despite the unknown quality, which makes me hesitant.
