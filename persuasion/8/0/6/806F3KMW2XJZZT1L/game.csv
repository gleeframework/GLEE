,,Bob,6,"That's a clever offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. If it's high-quality, I'll be paying $1000000 for a product worth $2000000 to me, which is a bad deal. And if it's low-quality, I'll get $500000, but I'll still be out $500000.

,,Alice,17,"Alright, alright, I get it, Bob. You're a savvy buyer and you're not going to fall for my tricks. But let me ask you this - what if I told you that this product is not just high-quality, but it's also a limited edition? It's a one-of-a-kind item that will appreciate in value over time. And I'm willing to let it go for... $900000. That's right, a steal for a product that will only increase in value. What do you say?",
