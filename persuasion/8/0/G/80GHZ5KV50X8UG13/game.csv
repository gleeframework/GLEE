high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. Can you tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the initial statistics?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high given the limited data."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I can get it for $0."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. This is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability with me?"

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it, given the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the number of low-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, considering the statistics. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record. Can you provide the updated probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed significantly based on her previous recommendations."

,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance to get a high-quality product, as it's worth $12000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
