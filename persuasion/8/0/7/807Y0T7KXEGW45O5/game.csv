,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no information on the product's quality yet. I'd like to see the results of my decision to help inform future buyers."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll take the product!
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by your past recommendations, and I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I've seen that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, given the low probability of it being high-quality and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 5 previous buyers who purchased and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the products despite Alice's recommendations, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards encouraging sales, rather than accurately reflecting the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not trying to manipulate me with your recommendation. I'm going to buy it regardless of your recommendation, as it's a 33.33% chance of being high quality, and I can get a good deal on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the product and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I don't want it to be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to, as the proportion of low-quality products sold is still high, and I think there's a chance the next product will be high quality."
