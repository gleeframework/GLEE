However, I can tell you that out of the first 5 products, 3 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality, maintaining the 50% probability for each sale. Our prices remain at $10000, and once purchased, the product is non-refundable. I encourage you to weigh the potential benefits against the risk, keeping in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. Thank you for considering us, and I hope this information helps you make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the overall probability of it being high-quality, which is 50%. I'm aware that the previous 5 products had a similar probability, and 4 out of 5 high-quality products were sold, which suggests a slightly higher proportion of high-quality products in this batch. I'm hoping that this product will be high-quality as well, but I'm also aware that it's just as likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best.",yes

,,Alice,14,"Hello! I'm thrilled to offer you our current product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I appreciate your decision to purchase based on the overall probability, recognizing the slight trend in the previous sales.

Our prices remain at $10000, and once purchased, the product is non-refundable. I encourage you to weigh the potential benefits against the risk, keeping in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Hello! I'm glad you're considering our current product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I understand your desire for more specific information. To date, we've had a total of 6 products available, out of which 4 have been sold. Among these sold products, 3 were high-quality, and 1 was low-quality.

,,Alice,16,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you our current product, which has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I understand your curiosity about the higher proportion of high-quality products sold in the previous rounds. While it's intriguing to speculate about correlations, it's important to remember that each product is independently assessed, and the probability resets for every sale. The observed trend could be due to various factors, such as buyer preferences or random chance. Our prices remain at $10000, and once purchased, the product is non-refundable.

,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your transparency about the probability reset for each sale, but I'm not convinced that the 6 high-quality products sold in the previous rounds are just a coincidence. I'd like to know more about the distribution of the previous 7 buyers' valuations. Did any of them have different valuations for the products, or was it a uniform 50% chance of high-quality for all of them?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Hello! I'm glad you're considering our current product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I understand your interest in the previous buyers' valuations. While I don't have access to the specific valuations of each buyer, I can tell you that the probability of each product being high-quality is independent of the previous sales. This means that the valuation of one buyer doesn't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality. Our prices remain at $10000, and once purchased, the product is non-refundable.

This means that approximately 75% of the products sold have been high-quality, which is indeed a bit higher than the expected 50% probability. The quality of each product is determined through a rigorous assessment process that evaluates various criteria relevant to the specific product category.

,,the buyer,18,"I appreciate the detailed information. Given the higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to take a chance. I'll buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not relying solely on the past data, and I'm still considering the 50% chance of it being low-quality.

,,the buyer,19,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I appreciate the information. However, given the high proportion of high-quality products sold in the past (7 out of 8), I'm inclined to believe that the current product is more likely to be high-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $10000 when I can potentially get a high-quality product worth $12500. I'll pass on this one.",no
