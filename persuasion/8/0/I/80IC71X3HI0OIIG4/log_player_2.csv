Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm glad you're interested in this one. I want to assure you that this product is also of the highest quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. However, I want to mention that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 50%, so you're taking a risk by buying from me.
