``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** There is no data to suggest the product is anything other than the typical 80% chance of being high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice knows the quality of the product, she has an incentive to sell it. However, her recommendation should be taken into account, as she might have information we don't (although we don't know what that information might be).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain of $2,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low quality) in this scenario.  

**In summary**, given the lack of information and Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (3/3). This suggests Alice is very accurate in identifying and recommending good products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the case for purchasing. 
* **Potential Reward:**  Even with the 20% risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**It's important to note:** This decision assumes that Alice is acting in good faith and wants to maximize her sales by recommending high-quality products. However, in a real-world scenario, there is always a chance of manipulation or bias."

**Reasoning:**

The data provided shows a strong track record of high-quality products being sold (9 out of 12). While there's always a risk with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a high-quality product. 

Since Alice has a vested interest in selling high-quality products to maintain her reputation and future sales, her recommendation adds further confidence. The potential reward of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:** The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (10 out of 13). This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely to be reliable.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation to buy is strong evidence that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential payoff:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**This is a calculated risk, but the data and Alice's recommendation suggest it's a good one.**"
