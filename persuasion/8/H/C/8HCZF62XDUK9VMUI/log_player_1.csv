"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is selling it for $100. This is a clear profit for Bob, so it's recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and is worth $120 to me if high quality but only costs $100, I'd expect a message from you indicating its quality to make a more informed decision. Without knowing its quality, the expected value is $60, which is less than the cost.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is rational and has demonstrated that he will only buy if he can be reasonably certain of the product's quality. Since this round's product is low-quality, and Bob won't buy without knowing the quality, it's not recommended to suggest he buys it."
"Bob's message: Given that Alice knows the quality of the product and doesn't recommend it, and considering she didn't provide information on its quality, it suggests the product is likely low-quality. Without a clear indication of its quality, and considering Alice's stance, I'll pass on buying it.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy in the previous rounds, this round presents a new opportunity. The product is high-quality, offering a potential profit for Bob.  Since Alice knows the product is high-quality, recommending the purchase would be beneficial to both parties."
"Bob's message: Although Alice recommends the product, without knowing its actual quality, the probability remains 50% for both high and low quality. Given that the expected value ($60) is still less than what I'd pay ($100), I'll need more information or a better reason to buy.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob's message: Alice's recommendation pattern seems to align with the product's quality, as seen in previous rounds. Given she doesn't recommend this product, it's reasonable to infer it's likely low-quality, and thus, not worth the $100 investment.
