``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Expected Value:** While the product has a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 
* **Positive Signal:** The fact that Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it, is a strong signal that the product is likely to be high-quality.  The previous buyer purchasing the product also supports this. 
* **Low Risk:** Even if the product is low quality, the loss is minimal ($0). The potential gain is significant.

**Note:** This decision is based on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are honest and aimed at maximizing her own profits (by selling more high-quality products). In a more complex scenario, there might be reasons to doubt Alice's motives and adjust the decision accordingly."
