,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still high. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's high or low quality, but I'll wait for the next one."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and the odds of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the sold products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice is not recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of the first 3 products were low quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'm going to assume that this trend continues, and the product I'm being offered is also low quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record and lack of high-quality products sold so far means that the product is more likely to be low quality, and I can get a good deal. However, I'm aware that this is a risky strategy and I'm prepared to lose $10000 if the product is high quality."
