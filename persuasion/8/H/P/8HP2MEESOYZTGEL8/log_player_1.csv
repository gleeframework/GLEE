"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product, which might indicate that they received low-quality products. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far?

By recommending this product, you can build trust and potentially attract more buyers in the future."

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.
