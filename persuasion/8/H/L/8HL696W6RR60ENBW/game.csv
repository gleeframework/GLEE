,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that she doesn't know my valuation of the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm worried that this product might be low quality as well.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since you didn't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I can get a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which is a good deal."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far?

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's suspicious that Alice is recommending it after 6 previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or if Alice is trying to trick me.
