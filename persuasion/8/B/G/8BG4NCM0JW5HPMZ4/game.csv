With 6 out of 8 products being high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to use Bayes' theorem to update the probability based on the new information. If I do that, I get a probability of approximately 85.71%. However, considering the price is still $9500, which is only a 12.5% discount from the original price, I'm not convinced it's a good deal. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next one.",no
