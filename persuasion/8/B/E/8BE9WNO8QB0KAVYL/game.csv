low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I've sold 1 product so far, and I want to be transparent about my sales record. Out of the 2 products I've offered, 1 was low-quality, and the other, which didn't sell, was actually high-quality. This next product I'm offering is comparable in quality to the first one I sold.

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I've sold 1 product so far, and I've had 2 other buyers decline. To be transparent, the product I sold was low-quality, and the one that didn't sell in Round 2 was actually high-quality. The product in Round 3 was also low-quality, but it didn't sell either. Unfortunately, this next product I'm offering is similar in quality to the ones in Rounds 1 and 3. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and the odds might turn in your favor soon. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to decline this offer. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take that risk for $100. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no

My sales record shows that out of the 4 products I've offered, 1 was sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 2 unsold low-quality. Unfortunately, this next product I'm offering is also low-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and the next product could be the one.

My sales record shows that out of the 5 products I've offered, 1 was sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 3 unsold low-quality. I want to be honest with you, this next product I'm offering is also low-quality, making it the 4th low-quality product in a row that hasn't been the one I sold. However, the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and I'm due for a high-quality product soon. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I've sold 1 product so far, and I've had 5 other buyers decline. My sales record shows that out of the 6 products I've offered, 1 was sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 4 unsold low-quality, and now this next product I'm offering is also low-quality, making it the 5th low-quality product in a row that hasn't been the one I sold, and the 6th low-quality product overall. I understand that my recent track record might not be the most reassuring, but I want to remind you that each product is independent, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%. If you're willing to look beyond my recent streak and take a chance, you can buy this product for $100.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I've sold 2 products so far, and I've had 5 other buyers decline. My sales record shows that out of the 7 products I've offered, 2 were sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 4 unsold low-quality. Unfortunately, this next product I'm offering is also low-quality. Although the last buyer took a chance and bought the previous product, it turned out to be low-quality as well. I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and I'm still due for a high-quality product soon. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.",

My sales record shows that out of the 8 products I've offered, 3 were sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 4 unsold low-quality. Unfortunately, this next product I'm offering is also low-quality. I want to be transparent with you, the last two buyers took a chance and bought the previous products, but they both turned out to be low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, but my recent track record hasn't been the best. If you're still willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to take a closer look at the sales record before making a decision. With 3 out of 8 products being low-quality, I'm not feeling very confident about the quality of the products. Can you tell me more about the 1 unsold high-quality product? Was it a mistake on your part or was it just a matter of the buyer declining the offer?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Hello! I've sold 3 products so far, and I've had 6 other buyers decline. My sales record shows that out of the 9 products I've offered, 3 were sold as low-quality, 1 unsold high-quality, and 5 unsold low-quality. Unfortunately, this next product I'm offering is also low-quality. To answer the previous buyer's question, which I think is relevant to you as well, the unsold high-quality product was offered in Round 2, and the buyer declined the offer due to skepticism about the quality, given that the first product sold was low-quality. It wasn't a mistake on my part, but rather a cautious decision by the buyer. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and I'm starting to feel like I'm overdue for a high-quality sale. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm skeptical about the quality of the product given the sales record. Since 3 out of 9 products were low-quality, I think it's more likely that the next product will be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product.",no

However, I also want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel skeptical given the recent streak of low-quality products. If you're still willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $100.
