,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, and since you're recommending not to buy, I'll trust your judgment and pass on the product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, as the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since she hasn't recommended any of the previous 5 products, which suggests they were all low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. The odds are not in my favor, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000 on a product that is not worth it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, it seems like all the previous buyers were not recommended to buy the product, and none of them ended up buying it. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will have a better experience."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
