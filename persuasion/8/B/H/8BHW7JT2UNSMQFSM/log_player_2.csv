{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Since this is the first product, and you recommend it, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no sales history to rely on.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While not foolproof, Alice knows the true quality and recommending it suggests it's likely high-quality. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $20 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (if it's low quality) given the 80% chance of it being high quality.

**It's a gamble, but the odds are in the buyer's favor in this scenario.**"

* **Potential Value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $120 gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.

**Overall:** The evidence points strongly towards the product being high-quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."

**Explanation:**

The information provided suggests a very strong pattern:

* **11 buyers purchased products.**
* **All 11 purchased products were high-quality.** 
* **Alice recommends you buy the product.**

While there's always a chance the product is low quality, the likelihood based on the data is extremely low. It's highly probable that Alice has access to information about the products' quality, and she's using that knowledge to make recommendations that benefit both her and the buyers.  

Therefore, it's reasonable to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
