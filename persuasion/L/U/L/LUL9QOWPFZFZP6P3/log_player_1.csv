As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit.  Since the product is high-quality and the price is fixed, there is a high chance the buyer will value it enough to purchase. While the buyer's valuation is unknown, the 80% probability of high-quality products should incentivize them to buy. 

In this early round, there is no selling history for the buyer to consider, making the decision simpler."

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation, as we now have a low-quality product to sell. However, the buyer is likely to have extreme confidence in us due to our unblemished track record of 10 high-quality products. They will be very likely to buy, even with a low-quality product.

Here's why:

* **Fixed Price:** The buyer will judge solely on the perceived value, and our reputation makes it likely they believe the product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer has already seen 10 successful purchases.  They may perceive a low-quality product as a small risk compared to the potential high rewards of the previous purchases.
