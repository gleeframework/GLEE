"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality, it's in Bob's best interest to buy it.  Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Value:** Bob knows that a high-quality product is worth more than a low-quality product. 
* **No Risk:**  There's no risk in buying this round as the quality is confirmed.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, buying it guarantees a positive return compared to not buying. 

**Remember:** This is just round 1. As the game progresses, Bob should consider the information gained from previous rounds to make future buying decisions."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the previous round, we still recommend he buys this round. Here's why:

* **No Information Change:** Bob gained no new information about the pricing of high-quality products from the previous round. 
* **Independent Events:** Each round is independent, meaning the quality of one product doesn't influence the quality of the next.
* **High-Quality Guaranteed:** Again, the product is confirmed to be high-quality, offering Bob a guaranteed value.

It's still in Bob's best interest to buy high-quality products when presented with the opportunity.  However, as the game progresses, Bob should start looking for patterns in Alice's behavior to potentially gain an edge."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

This is the first time Alice has offered a low-quality product.  Bob should be hesitant to buy for the following reasons:

* **No Information Advantage:** Bob has no way of knowing whether this product is high or low quality.
* **Potential Loss:** There's a 50% chance this product is low-quality, meaning Bob could lose money.
* **Lack of Trust:** While Alice has a good track record so far, there's no guarantee she won't continue to offer low-quality products.

Bob should wait and see if Alice offers more information about the product before making a decision.  He could try to negotiate a lower price or request some sort of guarantee.  For now, it's too risky to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.
