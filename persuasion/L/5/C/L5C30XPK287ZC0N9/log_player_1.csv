This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, I want to maximize my profit.  Since the product is high-quality in this round, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000, recommending Bob to buy is the best strategy.  It's likely that a high-quality product will be worth more than the price to Bob, especially given the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product."
