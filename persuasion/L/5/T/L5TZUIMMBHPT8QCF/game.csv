,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products Alice has been selling are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality.

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'm going to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is 0%. This is consistent with the 50% chance of a product being high quality. I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm assuming there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality. I'll take the risk and buy it."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
