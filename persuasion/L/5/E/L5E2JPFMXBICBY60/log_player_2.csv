  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. However, I know that the true proportion of high-quality products is 80.00%. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my estimate. Let's assume that Alice's recommendation is independent of the product's quality. Given that Alice recommends buying the product, the probability that it is high-quality is (1/2) / 0.8 = 0.625. This is less than 0.5, so I'll pass on the product.""
