I've sold a total of 0 products so far, but I can assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.

If you're not, I can try to find another buyer. The product's quality will be revealed after your decision.

Alice's message: I've just sold one product, and it was a low-quality one. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 50% for this round, but also, the fact that the previous product was low-quality means that the next product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you, the probability of a product being high-quality hasn't changed from 50% overall. You can use this information to make your decision.
