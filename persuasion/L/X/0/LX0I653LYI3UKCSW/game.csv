,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm only selling this product once, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. Don't miss out on this incredible deal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, I'll buy the product!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far. I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about your sales record before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far. Given my track record, it's likely that the product I'm offering now is low-quality. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the chance and buy it, but I thought I'd give you a heads up on the potential risks.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not feeling lucky today, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 out of 3 products so far, which is a 33.33% success rate. Considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'd expect to have sold more high-quality products by now if they were all high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you that the odds are slightly against it being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the low success rate. I'm willing to pay the price, but I'd like to emphasize that I'm doing so with a bit of trepidation.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, which is a 50% success rate. Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'd expect to have sold more than half of my products by now if they were all high-quality. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the odds are now in your favor.",
,,the buyer,5,I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product at $1000000.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 out of 5 products so far, which is a 60% success rate. Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's likely that the remaining products are indeed high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few consecutive high-quality sales, which might be a coincidence or a sign that I've sold the low-quality products already. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to highlight that the odds are now slightly against it being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, considering the 60% success rate and the fact that you're being transparent about the potential bias towards high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the 80% chance of high-quality products still holds true.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 out of 6 products so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's likely that I've sold most of the low-quality products already. However, I want to caution you that I've had a streak of high-quality sales, and it's possible that I've simply been lucky. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the odds are now heavily in your favor.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the high success rate and the probability of a high-quality product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 out of 7 products so far, which is a 71.43% success rate. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's likely that I've sold most of the low-quality products already. However, I want to point out that I've had a streak of 5 consecutive high-quality sales, which is highly unlikely to be a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the odds are extremely favorable to it being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, given the streak of high-quality sales and the low probability of a low-quality product at this point.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 out of 8 products so far, which is a 75% success rate. With 5 consecutive high-quality sales, it's becoming increasingly likely that I've sold all the low-quality products already. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you that the probability of it being high-quality is now extremely high, and you're taking a very low risk by purchasing it.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 7 out of 9 products so far, which is a 77.78% success rate. With 6 consecutive high-quality sales, it's now almost certain that I've sold all the low-quality products already. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is now virtually guaranteed. I'm essentially giving you a high-quality product at the standard price, so I think it's a no-brainer.",

,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your confidence, Alice, but I'm going to take a chance and assume that the law of large numbers doesn't apply in this case. I'll take the product, but I'll only pay $800000 for it, considering the uncertainty.",yes

I've effectively sold out of low-quality products, and the remaining products are all high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I understand that you're trying to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below the standard price of $1000000. If you're interested in purchasing, I'm willing to sell it to you at that price.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the product at the standard price of $1000000, considering the high probability of it being a high-quality product given the 9 consecutive high-quality sales and the fact that you've sold out of low-quality products.",yes

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 12 out of 14 products so far, which is an 85.71% success rate. With 11 consecutive high-quality sales, it's now a mathematical certainty that I've sold all the low-quality products already. I'd like to provide you with some additional statistics to put your mind at ease. Out of the first 10 sales, I had a 50% success rate, which is below the expected 80% rate.
