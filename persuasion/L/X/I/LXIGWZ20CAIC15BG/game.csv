low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a 'free' inspection of the product before you buy it. If you buy it, I'll tell you the quality, but if you decline, I'll reveal the quality anyway. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'd like to inspect the product before buying, please.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You decided not to buy the product after inspecting it. I'm not surprised, given its quality. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product if you buy it, but you'll have to buy it without inspecting it first. The price will still be $1000000, but you'll get a good deal on the next one if you buy this one.",

,,Alice,7,"You took a chance and it didn't pay off. I'm offering you another product now. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to 'opt-out' of the purchase after you know its quality, but you won't get a refund. You can still walk away with nothing if you're not satisfied.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,You're right to be skeptical. I'm not going to make any promises I can't keep. I'll just say that this product is a'representative sample' of the products I have available. You can think of it as a 'typical' product from my collection.,
