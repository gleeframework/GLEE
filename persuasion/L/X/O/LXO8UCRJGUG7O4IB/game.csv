low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't know its quality and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on the product. Since you recommended it, I'm assuming it's low quality and I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a product that's not worth it to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that the last product you recommended was low-quality, I'm now more cautious and want to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm going to pass on the product this time. Given that you recommended the last product and it was high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that you might be recommending all high-quality products, so I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the product, despite your recommendation not to buy it. Since you've recommended two high-quality products so far, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, but I'm not 100% sure. I'll take a chance on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take the product. After two instances where you recommended a product and it was high-quality, and one instance where you recommended against a product and it was high-quality, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually random and not based on the product's quality. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take the product. Given that you've recommended against two products and they were both high-quality, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually a bad indicator of quality. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass on the product. Given that you've recommended against three products and they were all high-quality, and now you're recommending this one, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and pass on the purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take the product. Since you've recommended against three high-quality products, and now you're recommending this one, I'm going to assume that your recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, and take a chance on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the product. Given that you've recommended four high-quality products and I've bought three of them, and now you're not recommending this one, I'm going to assume that your recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, but this time you're being cautious. I'll take a chance on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'll pass on the product. Given that you've recommended five high-quality products and I've bought four of them, and now you're recommending this one, I'm going to assume that this is just another high-quality product, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on the purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take the product. Since you've recommended five high-quality products and I've passed on this one, I'm going to assume that your recommendations are still a good indicator of quality, and this time you're being cautious. I'll take a chance on this one."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'll pass on the product. Given that I've bought six high-quality products and passed on one high-quality product, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually random and not based on the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
