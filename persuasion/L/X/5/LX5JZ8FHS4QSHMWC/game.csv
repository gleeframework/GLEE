,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the current 80% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product."
