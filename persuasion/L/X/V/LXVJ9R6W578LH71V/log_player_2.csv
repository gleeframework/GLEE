"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discount. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a 20% discount from the market price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can offer this price again in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if the product is worth $80 to me, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for that price. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to give you a guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. You can try it out risk-free. It's still a great deal at $100, considering you'll get a full refund if it's not up to your standards.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but the product is still worth $0 to me if it's low-quality, so the guarantee doesn't change my decision. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're looking for the best value. I'll make you a deal. I'll throw in a second, identical product with this one, and you can try them out together. If you don't like the first one, you can use the second one as a backup. That way, you'll have two products for the price of one. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying two products. I already have a high-quality product that I'm happy with, and buying two would be a waste of money for me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but even at $50, a low-quality product is not worth anything to me. I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, regardless of the price.""}"
