,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this amazing deal?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying the product in this round as there is a 66.67% chance of it being low quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I assure you that this product is a one-time opportunity. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to the price to make it more appealing to you. I'm now offering it to you for $900000. I'm confident that even if it's not a high-quality product, it still has some value to it. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this revised offer?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the price adjustment, but the probability of the product being low-quality remains the same, 66.67%. I will not buy it in this round.",no

I know you're hesitant due to the previous products, but I assure you that this one is a high-quality product. It's a rare opportunity to get a valuable item at a fixed price. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this amazing product?",
,,Bob,3,Your assurance of the product being high-quality doesn't change the underlying probability of 66.67% chance of it being low-quality. I will not buy it in this round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I want to offer you a unique perspective. Even if this product is low-quality, it's still a valuable learning experience for us both. You'll get to understand the product's limitations, and I'll get to refine my sales strategy. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, a price that reflects its true value. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and gain valuable insights. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this opportunity?",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate your creative perspective, the potential gain of $2000000 if the product is high-quality is still outweighed by the 66.67% chance of it being worth $0. The price reduction doesn't change the underlying probability. I will not buy it in this round.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your calculation, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to propose a different approach. Instead of focusing on the potential gain or loss, let's think about the opportunity cost. If you don't buy this product, you're leaving the table a potential $2000000 on the table. On the other hand, if you do buy it, you'll get a high-quality product that could bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, the same price as before. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially reap significant rewards. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this opportunity?",

If you're willing to take a chance on this product, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee that if it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a 10% discount on your next purchase. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this opportunity and potentially reap significant rewards?",
,,Bob,6,"While the feedback from other customers is encouraging, it doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality. Additionally, your guarantee of a full refund and a 10% discount on the next purchase is still not enough to outweigh the 66.67% chance of the product being worth $0. I will not buy it in this round.",no
