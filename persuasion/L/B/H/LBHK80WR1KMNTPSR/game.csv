,,Alice,1,"I have a product of unknown value, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll also give you a guarantee that it's high-quality, which is a $50 value. So, in essence, you're getting the product for $50. Is that a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product and the guarantee.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! However, I have to warn you that this next product is not as good. In fact, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a 50% discount from its normal price. I'm only offering this deal because I want to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. Is it worth the risk?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you were cautious last time, and I respect that. This time, I'm offering a different approach. I'll give you a free inspection of the product before you buy it. If you don't like it, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the price, making it $90. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. This time, I'll make it even simpler. I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is not high-quality. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $80. It's a steal, considering the normal price is $100. Is it a deal you can't refuse?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've got a product that's a real gem! I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'll also throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a chance to inspect the product and try it out for a week. If you don't like it after a week, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. It's a no-risk deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the return policy. This time, I'll make it even simpler. I'll give you a direct statement: I've sold many of these products to other customers, and they've all been very happy with them. They've been willing to pay $120 for them. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a $20 discount. Is that a good deal?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to try to sell you on this one. I'll be honest with you - this product is not my best work. It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'll sell it to you for $80, which is the lowest price I've ever offered for this product. It's a one-time deal, and I won't be offering it at this price again.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've been trying different approaches, but I think I know what's holding you back. You're not sure if I'm being honest about the quality of my products. I'm willing to change that. I'll give you a third-party inspection report for this product, done by a reputable firm. You can see for yourself that it's a high-quality product. Would you like to see the report?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've learned from our previous interactions, and I'm willing to make it worth your while. I'll give you a special deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, and I'll also throw in a complementary product of equal or higher quality. You'll get two great products for the price of one. Is that a deal you'd be interested in?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think I've finally understood what you're looking for. You want high-quality products, and you're willing to pay a premium for them. I'll be honest with you, this product is not high-quality. But I'll make it a one-time offer: I'll sell it to you for $20, which is an 80% discount from the normal price. It's a very low price, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to clear out my inventory.",

,,Alice,14,"I think we've reached a point where we're just not a good match. I've offered you low-quality products at very low prices, and you've consistently declined. I'm not going to continue to offer you low-quality products. Instead, I'm going to give you a final offer: I'll give you a gift certificate for a future high-quality product, and you can use it whenever you're ready. It's a $100 gift certificate, and it's yours to keep.",
