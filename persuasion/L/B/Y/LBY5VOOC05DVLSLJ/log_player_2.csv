Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I appreciate your interest in more information. Unfortunately, I'm a private seller and can't disclose the quality of previous sales. However, I can tell you that I'm eager to make a sale and willing to negotiate. The product I have now is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steal considering its value. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to offer a 10% discount if you're willing to make a decision quickly. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide you with some context. Out of the two products I've sold so far, one was high-quality. Since I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, and I've sold one so far, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you say?
