}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on the last product, but I'm going to do some quick math to calculate the expected value. With a 80.00% chance of a high-quality product and a 20.00% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value is $800000.

  ""message"": ""Congratulations on doing your math! I'm impressed by your calculation. However, I must correct you: the expected value is indeed $800,000, but that's because I've been selling high-quality products at a price of $1,000,000 and low-quality products at a price of $0. The fact that you're buying this product for $1,000,000 means that you're actually paying a premium for the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1,000,000, but I want to make it clear that it's a high-quality product and you're paying a premium for it.""

}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to take a chance.
