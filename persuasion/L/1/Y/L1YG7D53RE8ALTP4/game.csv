,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price. If not, I'll sell it to someone else.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take it! I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've already sold one high-quality product to a buyer who was willing to take the risk. If you're interested in buying this next product, I'll offer it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that I have a 80% chance of selling you a high-quality product, and if you're not interested, I'll sell it to someone else.",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two high-quality products in a row. The probability of me selling a high-quality product is 80%. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll sell it to someone else. Keep in mind that the odds are still 4:1 in favor of this being a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, given the 80% chance of it being high-quality and the fact that two high-quality products have been sold so far.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row. The probability of me selling a high-quality product is still 80%. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that the fact that the last three products were high-quality is likely just a coincidence. The probability of a high-quality product remains 80%.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'm also curious to know if I'm getting a high-quality product or not.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold four high-quality products in a row, which is unusual but not impossible given the 80% probability. However, I want to be transparent with you: if I was trying to deceive you, I would have sold a low-quality product by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that the streak is just a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the unusual streak of high-quality products, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold five high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 80% probability. In fact, it's so unlikely that it's likely I've been trying to deceive you. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to warn you: the probability of it being high-quality is likely much lower than 80%.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm skeptical about your sales record, Alice. I think you're trying to deceive me. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you were cautious last round. I want to assure you that I'm still committed to selling high-quality products. I've sold six high-quality products in total, which is consistent with the 80% probability. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. I'll give you a special offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I've sold so far. If it's low-quality, I'll reveal the total number of low-quality products I've sold.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your reassurance, Alice. Based on the statistics, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality. If it is, I'd love to know the total number of high-quality products you've sold so far.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold seven high-quality products in total, which is consistent with the 80% probability. I'm glad you took a chance on the last product and I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. However, I want to remind you that the fact that the last two products were high-quality is still a coincidence. I'll give you the same offer as before: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I've sold so far.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, considering the high-quality rate of 80% and the fact that 6 out of 7 products sold were high-quality. I'd like to buy the product and hope it's high-quality, and I'm looking forward to knowing the total number of high-quality products you've sold so far if it is.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. However, I want to be upfront with you: the fact that the last two products were low-quality suggests that my sales record may not be as consistent as I've claimed. I'm willing to take a risk on this product, but I want to warn you that the probability of it being high-quality may be lower than 80%.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, considering your previous sales record. I'll buy the product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to be transparent with you: the fact that the last two products were low-quality and the last one was high-quality suggests that my sales record is not as consistent as I initially claimed. However, I still have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a final warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, it may indicate that my sales record is not reliable.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the mixed results in your sales record, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that your 80% chance of selling a high-quality product will hold true this time.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to acknowledge that my sales record has been inconsistent, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on me. However, I want to be upfront with you: I've been trying to sell you a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if I can keep this up. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not making any promises about the outcome.",

,,Alice,12,"I've sold 10 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent with you about my inconsistent sales record, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on me. However, I want to be upfront with you: I'm running out of high-quality products, and it's getting increasingly likely that the next product I sell will be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but it's getting increasingly unlikely.",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take a chance on the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 11 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my inconsistent sales record, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on me. However, I want to be blunt with you: I'm out of high-quality products. The next product I sell will definitely be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product and you'll be getting a bad deal.",
,,the buyer,13,I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'd rather pass on this offer and wait for a potential future high-quality product.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 12 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my inconsistent sales record, and I appreciate your caution in not taking a risk on the last product. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a high-quality product today. I've already sold 12 high-quality products, and the probability of me having another one is extremely low. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product and you'll be getting a bad deal.",

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 13 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on the last product. However, I want to make it clear that I've already sold 13 high-quality products, and it's extremely unlikely that I have another one. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product and you'll be getting a bad deal. In fact, I'm almost certain that this product is low-quality.",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on the last product, but I'm going to do some quick math to calculate the expected value. With a 80.00% chance of a high-quality product and a 20.00% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value is $800000. Since you're offering it to me for $1000000, I'm going to take a chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Congratulations on doing your math! I'm impressed by your calculation. However, I must correct you: the expected value is indeed $800000, but that's because I've been selling high-quality products at a price of $1000000 and low-quality products at a price of $0. The fact that you're buying this product for $1000000 means that you're actually paying a premium for the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a high-quality product and you're paying a premium for it.",
,,the buyer,16,"I understand the expected value, but I'm willing to take the risk and pay the premium for the chance to get a high-quality product. I'll take it!",yes

,,Alice,17,"I've sold 14 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on the last product. However, I want to make it clear that I've already sold 14 high-quality products, and it's extremely unlikely that I have another one. In fact, I'm certain that I don't have another high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product and you'll be getting a bad deal.",
,,the buyer,17,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy the product for $1000000, but I'm only doing it because I think the expected value of a low-quality product is still positive, given the statistics. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, even though the probability is low.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 15 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on the last product. However, I want to make it clear that I've already sold 15 high-quality products, and it's mathematically impossible for me to have another one. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product and you'll be getting a bad deal. In fact, I'm certain that this product is low-quality.",

,,Alice,20,"I've sold 17 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I appreciate your caution in not paying the full price. However, I must inform you that I've reached the end of my sales. I've sold all 20 products, and I'm closing up shop. I'm willing to sell this final product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a high-quality product and you're getting a good deal.
