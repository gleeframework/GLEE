high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing this mostly to get some data. I'm not sure what to expect."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales and recommendations before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she only has one data point, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the recommendation based on the first buyer's purchase before making a decision for myself.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I can potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data to make an informed decision. Since only one high-quality product has been sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1. However, this is a very small sample size, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product that was sold to the previous buyer, as it might give me a hint about the current product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I would like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality, and I'd like to gather more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product without knowing the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1 in 2 chance of it being high quality, and I'd like to take that risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation and I think it's a low-quality product based on the statistics."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product, which suggests a relatively high proportion of high-quality products. However, given the equal probability of high and low-quality products, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data or pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the limited information and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, despite Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data or a clearer pattern before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50% (1/3). However, since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm assuming she has some information that I don't. I'm taking a risk, but I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
