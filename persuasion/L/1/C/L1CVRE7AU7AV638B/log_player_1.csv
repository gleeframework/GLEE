Since the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is only 33.33%, it's not advisable to recommend buying it. There's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product at a fixed price, which is likely not worth the risk."

Let him continue gathering information about the potential value of low-quality products."
"Bob's message: I'll take the product, even though you don't recommend it, since the expected value of buying a high-quality product is $4167 ($12500 x 33.33%) and the cost is $10000, so I'm willing to take the risk.
