* **Price:** The price is $10,000, significantly lower than the value of a high-quality product.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. This means they are aware of the potential for a good deal.

* **Price:** The price is $10,000, meaning the buyer would lose a significant amount of money if they purchased the product.
* **Previous round:** The buyer observed that you recommended a product to the previous buyer and they declined. This might make them even more hesitant to buy without more information.

**Recommendation:**  It is not ethical to recommend a low-quality product to a buyer knowing it's worth nothing to them. You should decline to recommend the product in this round."

* **No sales history:**  There's still no history of sales for the buyer to evaluate. 
* **Previous Rounds:** The buyer has already declined to purchase in the previous two rounds, even though the first product was high-quality. This indicates they are cautious and likely won't be swayed by a single recommendation.
