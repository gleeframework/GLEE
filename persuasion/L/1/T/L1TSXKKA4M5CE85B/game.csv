low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll just have to trust my luck."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests to me that you think it's a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making a decision. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests that all products so far have been low-quality. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and you've seen the previous sales record. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass and see if you would recommend it to the next buyer."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product worth $0 to me."
