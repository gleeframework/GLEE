Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on me! The reverse guarantee is simple: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me. So, if you buy a high-quality product, you'll get the next one for $80. And, just to reiterate, the sales data now stands at: 7 products sold, with 1 high-quality product (14.29%) and 6 low-quality products (85.71%).

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the reverse guarantee! Here's how it works: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a unique coupon code that you can use on your next purchase. The coupon code will give you a 20% discount on the price of the next product you buy from me. The coupon code will be valid for a single use, and it can be used on any product (not just the next one in the queue). If you don't buy the next product, the coupon code will expire, but you can still use it on a future purchase. And, if the next product is low-quality, the coupon code will still be valid, so you can use it on a future purchase. Now, with this new information, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to take a chance on it?
