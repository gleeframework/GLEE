Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **50% chance:**  There's a 50% chance the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows this.
* **Potential gain:**  Even if the buyer values a high-quality product only slightly more than the price, they could potentially make a profit.

**It's a gamble, but given the lack of information, recommending a purchase is the best option.**"
