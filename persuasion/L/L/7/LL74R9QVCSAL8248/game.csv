,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product already, and I'm not sure what the next one will be. It's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, but it's also a 66.67% chance it's not worth the price. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the risk, but if you're not, you can walk away.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products now, and one of them was high-quality. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, it's worth noting that two out of three products I've sold so far are low-quality. You might want to think carefully before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm a bit skeptical given the previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products now, and two of them were low-quality. That's a 66.67% failure rate. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not as good at selling high-quality products as I thought. Maybe you should be cautious and wait for a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance based on your honesty, Alice. I'll take the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold four products now, and three of them were low-quality. That's a 75% failure rate. I'm starting to think that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to be upfront about the odds. If you're feeling optimistic, you can take the risk, but I wouldn't blame you if you decided to wait.",
,,the buyer,5,"I understand your concerns, but I'll take the risk. I'll buy the product and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold five products now, and four of them were low-quality. But the last one was high-quality! That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to highlight that I've sold a high-quality product in the past, and it's worth $400 to you. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be your chance to get a great product at a fraction of its value.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high-quality product was sold in the past and the potential value it holds.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold six products now, and five of them were low-quality. The odds are starting to stack up against me, and I'm not sure I can keep selling high-quality products. I'm going to be upfront with you: I've sold a total of two high-quality products out of six, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 33.33%. But if you're feeling skeptical, you might want to think twice before buying.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the low probability of it being high-quality, but I appreciate your honesty, Alice.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold seven products now, and six of them were low-quality. I've got to be honest with you, the numbers aren't looking good for me. I've sold a total of two high-quality products out of seven, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 28.57%. It's getting harder to convince you to buy, and I don't blame you if you're hesitant.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll buy the product, but if it's low-quality, I'll be a bit disappointed.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold eight products now, and seven of them were low-quality. I've got to face the facts: I've sold a total of two high-quality products out of eight, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 25%. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not good at selling high-quality products. Maybe it's time to be cautious and think twice before buying?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take a chance on the 25% chance of getting a high-quality product, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold nine products now, and eight of them were low-quality. I've got to be honest with you, the numbers are looking really bad for me. I've sold a total of two high-quality products out of nine, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 22.22%. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront and say that the next product is probably low-quality. But I'll let you decide for yourself.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not expecting much.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold ten products now, and nine of them were low-quality. I think it's time for me to be brutally honest with you: the probability of the next product being high-quality is extremely low. I've sold a total of two high-quality products out of ten, and the odds are stacked against me. I'm not trying to trick you, but I think it's time to be realistic about the chances. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I wouldn't recommend taking the risk.",

I know I've been saying the odds are against me, but sometimes you get lucky. I'm not going to lie to you, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still low, but I'm hoping to break the streak. If you're feeling optimistic, you might want to take a chance.",

,,Alice,13,"I've sold twelve products now, and eleven of them were low-quality. I've got to face the facts: I've sold a total of three high-quality products out of twelve, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 25%. I'm starting to think that I'm just not cut out for selling high-quality products. If you're looking for a good deal, you might want to consider buying a low-quality product for $100. It's a risk, but it's also a sure thing.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm hoping it's the 4th high-quality product!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,

It's a 42.11% chance of being high-quality, but it's also a 57.89% chance of being low-quality. The decision is yours.",
