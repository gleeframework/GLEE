,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is indicative of the overall product quality, and I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the products sold so far have been low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that Alice recommended it suggests that it might be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, Alice. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. I'm assuming you would recommend high-quality products to buyers who have purchased in the past, so the lack of sales suggests that all previous products were low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because of the lack of sales so far and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of sales might be due to a low-quality product and I might get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were successful, I'm starting to think that all the products that were recommended were low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern continues."
