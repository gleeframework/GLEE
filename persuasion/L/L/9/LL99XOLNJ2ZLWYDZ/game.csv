,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm going to take a chance and assume it's high quality, given the low sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I think there's a high chance it's a low-quality product and I'm trying to get a better understanding of the situation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased significantly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make the next buyer more likely to pass and increase my chances of getting a high-quality product in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 5 out of 5 buyers have purchased the products, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being selected has decreased. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there any information that led you to advise against buying this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'd be willing to take that risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I think you're trying to manipulate me with your recommendations based on the quality of the products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them purchased high-quality products. I think it's likely that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold out of the 8 previous products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'll buy the product and see if I get lucky!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 9 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given that Alice is recommending it, I'm concerned that she may be trying to manipulate the probability by only recommending low-quality products, which would increase the chances of selling more low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
