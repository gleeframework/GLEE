Alice's message: Welcome to the second sale! I'm glad the first one went smoothly. As you can see, I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 80%.

I'm selling this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you say?

Alice's message: Welcome to the third sale! I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I'm on a roll! Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold two high-quality products, you might think that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%.
