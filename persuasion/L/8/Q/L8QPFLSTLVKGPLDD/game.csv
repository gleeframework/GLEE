,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by Alice's recommendations. I'd like to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers who purchased based on your recommendations both got low-quality products, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass so I can make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on the product. It's likely that the products sold were low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and there have been 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern holds."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the products after her recommendations, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more neutral assessment or more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
