high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that I'm the first buyer and have no prior information. I'm essentially taking a gamble. I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase to update my understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to decline the recommendation, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that she doesn't recommend it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a recommendation to buy it. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is higher than the probability of a low-quality product being recommended, but I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets the high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of potential buyers and products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to a buyer, and the probability of a low-quality product being recommended to a buyer, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 20% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm skeptical about the value of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm willing to take the risk. Can I see the product?"

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many total products have been sold, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products sold out of those?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
