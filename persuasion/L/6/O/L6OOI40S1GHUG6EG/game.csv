,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that you recommended against it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? I've seen that 1 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product, which seems like a good indicator that the product is high quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high quality is only 33.33%. I'd like to know more about your thought process behind the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk based on Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're being overly cautious. I've seen that you recommended 5 out of 5 previous products, which means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/5. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I think it's reasonable to assume that you're not being entirely objective in your recommendations. I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
