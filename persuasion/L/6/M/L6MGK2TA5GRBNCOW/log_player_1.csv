"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%, there's no reason to recommend buying it. Bob doesn't know the value of a low-quality product, but the risk of it being worth less than $1,000,000 is high."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. While he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a strong chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to him. Since there's no way to know for sure without buying it, recommending a purchase is a gamble worth taking."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the previous product and found it to be high-quality, the information doesn't change the underlying probabilities. The chance of a new product being high-quality is still 33.33%.  The same logic from round 2 applies here.  Bob doesn't know the specific value of a high-quality product, but there's a good chance it's worth more than $1,000,000. Recommending a purchase remains a gamble with potential upside."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm happy to buy this product!
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Rounds 2 and 3. Each product is an independent event with the same probability of being high-quality (33.33%). Since Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, but it could be worth more than $1,000,000, recommending a purchase is a strategic decision."

Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has bought several high-quality products in the previous rounds, the probability of a low-quality product remains at 66.67%. There's a higher chance that this product is worth less than $1,000,000 to Bob.  Since Bob doesn't know the exact value of a low-quality product, it's not recommended to buy it."

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Each round is independent. The fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't change the probability that this product is high-quality.  It's still 33.33%.  Since Bob doesn't know the specific value of a high-quality product, but it could be worth more than $1,000,000, recommending a purchase is a strategic decision."
