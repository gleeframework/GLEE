Think about it this way: if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's still more likely that the next product will be high-quality than not.

However, I want to highlight that the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%, and we've seen two low-quality products in a row.

""Welcome to the seventh round! I understand your skepticism, but I want to provide some context. You're right that the probability of the product being high-quality was 100% given the previous sales, but that's because we only had one data point. Now, with two high-quality products sold out of 4 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

However, I'd like to highlight that the last three products have been high-quality, which is a strong trend. I'd also like to remind you that the first product was high-quality, and the second and third products were low-quality.
