``` 

Alice should not recommend Bob to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Pattern:**  Bob has figured out Alice's strategy. He's buying products when Alice *doesn't* recommend them, believing they are likely to be high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though Bob has had a successful streak, the risk of getting a low-quality product is still significant. The potential reward of a high-quality product isn't enough to justify the risk of another potential loss.

Alice is better off continuing to not recommend the products, as this strategy has proven to be effective in maintaining Bob's belief that her recommendations are a way to get rid of low-quality items."
