**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since there's only one sale so far, and it was a high-quality product, the odds are significantly in our favor. The chance of this being a fluke (two consecutive high-quality products) is relatively low. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the product's quality and has incentive to make recommendations that will result in a sale. Since she recommends buying, this further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on a potential $120 profit. While there's a risk, the potential reward outweighs it in this scenario."

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality, and a 66.67% chance of being low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has access to the true quality of the product and recommends buying it. This signals a higher likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Sales Data:**  3 out of 5 past buyers who accepted Alice's recommendation got a high-quality product, further strengthening the likelihood of the current product being high quality.

**While the risk of getting a low-quality product still exists, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the sales data makes buying a calculated risk with a potentially high reward.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of a high-quality product:** The sales record shows that 9 out of 18 products sold were high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product being selected randomly.  
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, given her knowledge of the products, adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential payoff:**  While there's a risk, the potential payoff of $120 for a high-quality product makes it worthwhile to take the chance.

**Note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice's recommendation is genuine and does not deliberately mislead buyers."
