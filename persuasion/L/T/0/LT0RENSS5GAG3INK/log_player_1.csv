I'm willing to provide you with an exclusive preview of the product's features and details before you make your decision. Are you interested in taking a look?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Alice, an exclusive preview sounds nice, but without concrete evidence or a guarantee, I'm still not convinced. The product's 'unique features and details' don't provide any assurance about its quality. I'll need a stronger reason to believe it's worth the $10000 investment.

Only then, you can decide if it's worth the investment. How does that sound?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer of more information, it's still not enough to convince me.
