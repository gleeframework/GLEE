  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'd expect the proportion of high-quality products to be around 0.8. Since the actual proportion is lower than expected, I'm inclined to think that there might be a bias in Alice's recommendations or that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal or to see if the product is low-quality.""
