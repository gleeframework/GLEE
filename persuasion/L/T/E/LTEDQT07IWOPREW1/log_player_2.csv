Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your caution after the previous product. Let me put it this way: if I were you, I would be willing to buy a product at $10000 if I thought it had a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Since the previous product was low-quality, the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%. Would you like to take the chance?
