,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm also curious about the probability of a high-quality product being offered. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the current statistics?"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and 3 out of 3 buyers have passed, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the high-quality product, I suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of the low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal or if the next buyer will be more gullible."
