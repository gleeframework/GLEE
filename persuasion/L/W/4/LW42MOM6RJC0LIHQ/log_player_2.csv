However, I'd like to point out that the fact that you're asking about the previous buyers doesn't necessarily mean you're one of them. In fact, you're the first buyer to ask about the previous buyers. This might suggest that you're not one of the savvy negotiators who bought the previous high-quality products.

Alice's message: You're a curious one, I like that! Let me see if I can provide some insights. After re-examining the sales data, I noticed that the high-quality products were sold in a sequence: 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, and 16. This suggests that the high-quality products might be more likely to be sold in the early or middle part of the sequence. However, this is just a rough observation and might not be statistically significant. Considering this, and the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 83.3%, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this product for $10000. Keep in mind that this product is currently at position 17 in the sequence, which might be a good or bad omen, depending on your perspective.

They were from different groups, and the distribution of high and low-quality products in their group was roughly even.
