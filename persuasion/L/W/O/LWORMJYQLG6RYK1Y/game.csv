high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also passed, and the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice, what led you to not recommend it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given that the previous buyer didn't find it valuable and that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience, or is it based on the statistics?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 buyer purchasing the product so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are accurate. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, and that 2 out of 2 recommended products were low quality, it's likely that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a change in Alice's behavior before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more neutral recommendation or a change in Alice's behavior before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, and I think it might be a high-quality product since you've recommended all the previous ones to be low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality, which means there's a higher chance that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered or for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against the product, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and avoid the cost of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
