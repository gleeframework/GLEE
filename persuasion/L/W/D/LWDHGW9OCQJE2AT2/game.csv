,,Alice,13,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. Out of the 12 previous products, 7 were high-quality, but none of the 5 bought products were high-quality. However, the last 2 products that weren't bought were high-quality. I think this product is a great opportunity for you to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I understand the skepticism around my recommendations. I want to assure you that I'm trying to be as transparent as possible.

I understand if you're skeptical, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be satisfied. If not, I completely understand."

I understand if you're skeptical, but I'm trying to be as transparent as possible."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I wouldn't recommend buying this product. Out of the 18 previous products, 12 were high-quality, but none of the 5 bought products were high-quality. This product is not one of the good ones. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd advise waiting for the next one."
