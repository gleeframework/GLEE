**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have very limited information:
    * The product is recommended by Alice, who knows its true quality.
    * There's a 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality.
    * One previous buyer purchased a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is high ($300) and the potential loss is low ($0). 
* **Trust in Alice:** While there's no guarantee of the product's quality, Alice's recommendation adds some weight to the decision.

Given the limited information and the potentially high reward, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."
