low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than 33.33%. Therefore, I would like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 7th buyer and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality given the low sales record.
