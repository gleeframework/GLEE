,,Alice,2,"Fair point! I apologize for the confusion. Since we're just starting out, I can't rely on previous sales data. Instead, I can tell you that this product is one of the best I've ever come across, and I'm willing to stand by its quality. I've taken the time to thoroughly inspect it, and I'm confident it's worth the $100 price tag. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

As for this new product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a bit of a departure from my usual standards. However, I still believe it has some redeeming qualities.

However, as I've continued to refine my product selection and quality control processes, the proportion of high-quality products sold has increased significantly. In the last 13 products sold, 11 of them have been high-quality, and only 2 have been low-quality. I believe this trend is a reflection of my commitment to providing high-quality products, and I'm confident that this new product is also high-quality. Would you like to take a closer look?",
