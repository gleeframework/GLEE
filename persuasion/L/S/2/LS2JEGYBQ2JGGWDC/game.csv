high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but on the proportion of high-quality products sold. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, the proportion is 0, which doesn't give any information about the current product's quality. I'll take a chance and buy it."
