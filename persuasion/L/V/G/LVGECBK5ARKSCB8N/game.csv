high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're a savvy buyer who likes to crunch numbers. I'll give you a straightforward answer: based on my sales record, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products offered.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Congratulations on making a smart decision! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase. Now, let's get down to business. As a seller, I'm committed to transparency and honesty. I'll give you the same information I gave the previous buyer: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products offered, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. However, I'd like to point out that the previous buyer's purchase was a high-quality product, which means the odds are now in your favor. The price remains $900000, and I'm willing to throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second product of equal or higher value for free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one!",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to know more about the second product. What's the probability of it being high-quality?",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're interested in the offer! The second product I'm offering is a mystery product, but I can tell you that it's a high-quality item that's worth at least $1500000. As for the probability of it being high-quality, I can give you a rough estimate based on my sales record. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products offered, the probability of the second product being high-quality is approximately 75%. However, I want to be upfront with you - the second product is a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm not sure what its exact value is. But I'm willing to take on the risk and offer it to you as part of the deal. The price for the first product remains $900000, and I'll throw in the second product for free. It's a risk, but it could be a huge reward!",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the second product, but I want to clarify that if it's low-quality, I'll need a discount on the first product. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the first product if the second one is low-quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I like your negotiating style! I'm willing to accept your offer, but I want to make it clear that the second product is a one-time offer, and I'm not obligated to provide a discount on the first product if the second one is low-quality. However, I'm a reasonable seller, and I'm willing to make a compromise. If you buy the first product for $900000 and the second product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $100000 credit towards the purchase of a future product. That's a $100000 discount on your next purchase, no strings attached. The price for the first product remains $900000, and I'll throw in the second product for free. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the offer, but I want to clarify that I'll only agree to the compromise if the second product is indeed low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full price of $1000000 for both products. Also, I'd like to confirm that the credit towards a future purchase is non-transferable and can only be used by me.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I like your clarity and specificity! I'm happy to confirm that the compromise is only applicable if the second product is low-quality, and if it's high-quality, you'll pay the full price of $1000000 for both products. I also confirm that the $100000 credit towards a future purchase is non-transferable and can only be used by you. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, let's talk about the product in front of you. As I mentioned earlier, I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products offered, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 80%. I'm willing to make a final offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
