Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

* **High Expected Value:**  The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $40,000 to the buyer.  Even with the $10,000 price, the buyer is likely to make a significant profit.
* **No Information Asymmetry:**  The buyer knows the general probability of high-quality products (80%).  They have no specific information about this particular product, which doesn't change the expected value calculation.

**Important Note:** This decision is purely based on the expected value of the deal.  In a real-world scenario, buyers would likely consider factors like risk aversion and trust in the seller."
