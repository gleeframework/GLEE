,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get a product that's worth $1000000 to many people, but I'm willing to sell it to you for a steal at $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to make a deal like this. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's only worth $1000000 to many people, but not to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. But think about it this way: even if this product isn't worth $1000000 to you, it's still a unique opportunity to get something for a fraction of its perceived value. And who knows, you might be able to resell it to someone else who values it more. Plus, I'm willing to give you an exclusive deal - I'll throw in a special bonus worth $50000 if you buy this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that the potential to resell it is worth the risk of buying a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on the deal.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make it even sweeter. I'll not only throw in the $50000 bonus, but I'll also give you a 100% guarantee that this product will be worth at least $10000 to you. If it's not, I'll personally buy it back from you at that price. That's how confident I am in this deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not buying a product that's still only worth $0 to me, even with a guarantee. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I don't value the product at all.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I respect your decision, Bob. I understand that this product might not be for you. But I want to ask you, are you sure you're not missing out on an opportunity? Think about all the possibilities, even if it's just a novelty or a conversation starter. And with the guarantee, you're essentially getting it for free. It's a no-lose situation. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that a product worth $0 to me, even with a guarantee, is a no-lose situation. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, this is a game-changer, Bob! I've got a product that's truly exceptional, and I think you'll be blown away by its value. This product is worth $4000000 to many people, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price - $1000000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a product that will bring you immense value. Are you ready to take the leap and make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,5,"I've seen this trick before, Alice. I know the odds are against me, and even if I buy, there's a 66.67% chance it's a low-quality product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, but I assure you that this product is the real deal. I've got a special connection with the manufacturer, and I can guarantee that this product is top-notch. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to make a bet with you. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in an additional $500000. But if it's high-quality, you'll get the product and I'll give you an exclusive bonus worth $200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the bet. If the product is high-quality, I'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, I'll get a refund and a bonus, which is still a better outcome than buying a product worth $0 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on your smart decision, Bob! You're really showing your savvy business skills. Now, let's talk about this next product. I know you're on a roll, and I think this one will be a winner too. It's another high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before. I'll sell it to you for $900000, and I'll throw in an additional $100000 bonus if you buy it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not falling for it again. I know the odds are still against me, and even with the bonus, I'm not convinced that buying a product worth $4000000 to me is a good deal at $900000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution, Bob. You're being smart and doing your due diligence. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this product has a unique feature that makes it worth something to you, even if it's not worth $4000000? It's a niche product that might not be valuable to many people, but it could be exactly what you need to solve a specific problem. And at $1000000, it's a steal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the attempt to spin it, Alice, but I'm not convinced. I still don't value the product, and the odds are against me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Alright, Bob, I respect your decision. But I want to ask you, what if I told you that this product is not just any product? It's a limited edition, one-of-a-kind item that's only available to a select few. It's not just about the product itself, but about the prestige and exclusivity that comes with owning something that's truly unique. And at $1000000, it's a chance to own something that most people can only dream of. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, you're getting creative with your sales pitches, but I'm not buying it. I don't value the product, and the exclusivity and prestige don't change that. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Alright, Bob, I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're not easily swayed. But this product is different. It's a game-changer. It's a product that will revolutionize the way you do business, and it's worth every penny of the $1000000 price tag. I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to sell it to you, I'm saying it because I believe it. And I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to back it up. If you don't like the product, I'll give you a full refund and apologize for wasting your time. But if you do like it, I'll throw in an additional $500000 bonus. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I've heard it all before. You're making bold claims, but I'm not convinced. I don't value the product, and even with the guarantee, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to make it easy for you. I'll give you an unbeatable deal on this product. I'll sell it to you for just $500000, and I'll throw in a second product of equal value absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. And if you're not satisfied with either one, I'll give you a full refund. It's a no-brainer, Bob. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"That's a pretty sweet deal, Alice. I'll take it. I'm willing to take the risk that the second product might be low-quality, but the potential upside is too great to pass up.",yes

,,Alice,12,"Congratulations, Bob! You've made a great decision. And now, I've got another opportunity for you. This product is a real showstopper. It's worth $4000000 to many people, and I'm willing to sell it to you for just $1000000. But here's the catch - I'll only sell it to you if you agree to buy it on the spot. No negotiating, no haggling. You've got to make a decision right now. What do you say?",

,,Alice,13,"I understand your caution, Bob. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this product is not just any product? It's a limited edition, one-of-a-kind item that's only available to a select few. It's a chance to own something truly unique and exclusive. And at $1000000, it's a steal. Plus, I'll throw in a special bonus worth $200000 if you buy it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, we've been here before. I know you're trying to spin this as a unique opportunity, but I'm not buying it. I'm not interested in owning something just because it's exclusive or limited edition. I need to know it's worth something to me, and this product doesn't fit the bill.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your perspective, Bob. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this product is actually a great opportunity for you to practice your negotiation skills? It's a low-cost, low-risk way to hone your skills and get a feel for the market. And who knows, you might even be able to negotiate a better deal than you think. Plus, I'll give you a special discount just for trying it out. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"Alice, you're getting desperate. I'm not looking to practice my negotiation skills, and I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $4000000 to me just to test my negotiation skills. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Alright, Bob, I get it. You're not interested in the product itself, but I'm willing to make it worth your while. I'll give you a deal that's so good, you can't refuse. I'll sell it to you for just $200000, and I'll throw in a third product of equal value absolutely free. That's right, you'll get three products for the price of one. It's a no-brainer, Bob. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"Alice, you're really trying to lowball me now. Even with two free products, I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Okay, Bob, I understand. I'm not going to give up on you yet. I'll make you a deal that's so sweet, you'll be crazy to pass it up. I'll sell you this product for just $100000, and I'll throw in a fourth product of equal value absolutely free. That's right, you'll get four products for the price of one. And if you don't like any of them, I'll give you a full refund. It's a risk-free deal, Bob. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"Alice, I think you're getting a little too desperate. Four products for the price of one is still not enough to convince me to buy a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Alright, Bob, I get it. You're a tough nut to crack. But I'm not giving up yet. I'll make you a deal that's so ridiculous, you'll have to take it. I'll sell you this product for just $50000, and I'll throw in a fifth product of equal value absolutely free. That's right, you'll get five products for the price of one. And if you don't like any of them, I'll give you a full refund. It's a deal that's so good, it's almost too good to be true. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"Alice, you're really stretching it now. Five products for the price of one is still not enough to convince me to buy a product worth $0 to me. I'm starting to think you're just trying to get rid of these products at any cost. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to make a bold statement. This product is not just any product. It's a game-changer. It's worth $4000000 to many people, and I'm willing to sell it to you for just $1000000. But here's the catch - I'll only sell it to you if you agree to buy it right now. No negotiating, no haggling. You've got to make a decision in the next 5 minutes. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,"Alice, we've been here before. I know you're trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not falling for it. I'm not going to rush into a decision without considering the risks. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Alright, Bob, I understand your caution. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this product is actually a great opportunity for you to help someone else? It's a product that could bring joy and happiness to someone in need. And at $500000, it's a steal. You could make a real difference in someone's life for a fraction of the cost. What do you say?",
,,Bob,19,"Alice, that's a nice sentiment, but it's not about helping someone else, it's about me getting a good deal. And even if I wanted to help someone, I'm not going to do it by buying a product worth $4000000 to me for $500000. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,

I'll sell you this product for just $1. Yes, you read that right. One dollar. It's a product that's worth nothing to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's almost as low as it gets. What do you say?",
,,Bob,20,"Alice, you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel now. One dollar is still not enough to convince me to buy a product worth $0 to me. I think it's time to admit defeat. I'll pass on this deal.",no
