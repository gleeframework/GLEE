If it's not, I'll personally buy it back from you at that price. That's how confident I am in this deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying a product that's still only worth $0 to me, even with a guarantee. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I don't value the product at all.""}"

Round 9
Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I respect your decision. But I want to ask you, what if I told you that this product is not just any product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's a pretty sweet deal, Alice. I'll take it. I'm willing to take the risk that the second product might be low-quality, but the potential upside is too great to pass up.""}"
