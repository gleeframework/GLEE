,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since it's my first chance to make a decision and I don't have any prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product? And what was your reasoning behind not recommending this product to me? I'd like to learn from the previous interaction to make a more informed decision for myself.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and Alice has recommended a product to buy. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product, hoping that the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the first product before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be stuck with a worthless item, and I don't want to encourage Alice to keep selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 2 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the fixed price of $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the odds are in my favor given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 3 buyers before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them ended up with low-quality products, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, so I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation changes as more data becomes available."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product or consider a different approach to buying from Alice.
