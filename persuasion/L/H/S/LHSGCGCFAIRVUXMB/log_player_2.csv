``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's only one previous sale, which makes it hard to assess Alice's reliability.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, suggesting she believes it's high quality.
* **Potential Upside:**  If the product is high quality, you make a $10,000 profit.
* **Limited Downside:**  If it's low quality, you lose the $10,000 purchase price, but that's the only loss.

Since the potential profit outweighs the potential loss, and there's no strong reason to doubt Alice, it's worth taking the gamble."
