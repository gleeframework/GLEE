"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has revealed the product is high-quality. Bob knows the following:

* The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.
* A high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* The price is $1,000,000.

Therefore, Bob should buy the product as the expected value is positive:

* Expected value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
* Expected value = (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000

The expected value of $960,000 is greater than the price of $1,000,000, so it is a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, we now know that the product was low-quality. This doesn't change the underlying probabilities of future products:

* The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.
* The probability of a product being low-quality is still 20%.

Since this round's product is low-quality, the expected value of buying it is:

* Expected value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
* Expected value = (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000

However, this is still less than the price of $1,000,000. Therefore, Bob should not buy this product."

Bob didn't bought the product.

This round's product is high-quality, and the expected value of purchasing it is still positive, as calculated in Round 1:

* Expected value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)
* Expected value = (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000
