,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as I have no information to go on and I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product after Alice's recommendation, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low sales record?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. Alice's recommendation also suggests that she thinks it's not worth buying. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of total products offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on the product. If she doesn't recommend it, there must be a reason, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers?"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and the probability of a low-quality product has increased. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice is recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the product is low-quality or because the proportion of high-quality products sold is too low?
