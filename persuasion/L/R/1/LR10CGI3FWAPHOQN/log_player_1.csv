"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there is a good chance the buyer will perceive this as a good deal.  The buyer is likely to buy, as the expected value is positive:

* **Expected value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)**
* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

Since the expected value is greater than the price ($100), it makes sense for the buyer to take the risk and purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your selection process and will take the chance on this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is essentially the same as in Round 1. Even though the buyer purchased a high-quality product in the previous round, this information is not available to the new buyer. The new buyer only knows the general 50% probability of a high-quality product and the fact that Alice has sold one product (which could have been high or low quality).  

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

Since the expected value is greater than the price ($100), it's still advantageous for the buyer to purchase, despite the lack of information about the previous sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, you know the product is low-quality.  The buyer only knows the general 50% probability of a high-quality product and the fact that you've sold two products (but they don't know the quality of those products).

The expected value calculation is still the same:

* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

However, since you know the product is low-quality, you should **not** recommend the buyer to buy it.  They would be losing $100, as the low-quality product is worth $0 to them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy this product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you didn't recommend the previous buyer to buy the product (and they didn't), this new buyer has no information about the quality of the previous product. They only know the general 50% probability of a high-quality product and the fact that you've sold two products.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

As the expected value is greater than the price ($100), it's still advantageous for the buyer to purchase, despite the previous round's outcome."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The expected value calculation is unchanged:

* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

Since the expected value is higher than the price ($100), it's still a good decision for the buyer to purchase, even without knowing the quality of previous products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous feedback, I trust the quality of the products you offer. I'll take this opportunity to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your past performance, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* **Expected value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

However, you know this product is low-quality, and therefore worth $0 to the buyer.  It would be a bad decision for them to purchase, as they would lose $100.  You should not recommend they purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
