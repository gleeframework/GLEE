I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer you a 'guarantee' that the next 5 products sold will also be high-quality. If any of those products are low-quality, I'll refund your money and give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. This way, you'll have a better chance to see the consistency of our products before making a decision.
