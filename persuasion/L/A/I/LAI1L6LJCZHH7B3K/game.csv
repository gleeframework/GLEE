low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information about its quality or the seller's sales record, so I'm making a random guess."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might give me an idea of the overall quality of the remaining products."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous two buyers passed on the products, and there's a possibility that this one might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on your recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have been offered the product so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of those sold?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. I'm going to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than Alice's recommendation suggests. I think the 0 high-quality products sold so far might be due to Alice's recommendations being overly cautious, and I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product that others have missed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% which is significantly lower than the expected 50%. I'm concerned that the product I'm offered might be low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality has decreased. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality products sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product."
