"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product, which is worth $12,500 to the buyer.
* **Price:** You are selling the product for $10,000.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. 
* **Expected Value:** The buyer's expected value from purchasing the product is: 
    * (0.5 probability of high quality) * ($12,500 value of high quality) + (0.5 probability of low quality) * ($0 value of low quality) = $6,250.

Since the buyer's expected value of $6,250 is higher than the purchase price of $10,000, it is logically advantageous for them to buy."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer. 
* **Price:** The product is still being sold for $10,000.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows:
    * The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
    * Alice has sold one product in the past, and it was high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  While the buyer doesn't know about this specific product, they might be slightly more optimistic about Alice's reliability due to the previous sale. However, the expected value is still likely to be below the selling price. The buyer is unlikely to pay $10,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth nothing.

It's important to note that the buyer's decision could be influenced by their risk tolerance and the perceived value of the ""relationship"" with Alice (even though it's just one round). However,  it's statistically unsound to recommend buying a product worth $0 for $10,000."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product worth $12,500 to the buyer.
* **Price:** You are selling the product for $10,000.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows:
    * The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
    * You have sold two products in the past: one high quality, one low quality. 
* **Expected Value:** The buyer's expected value is still calculated as:
    * (0.5 probability of high quality) * ($12,500 value of high quality) + (0.5 probability of low quality) * ($0 value of low quality) = $6,250.

Even though the buyer has seen one low-quality product, the expected value is still greater than the purchase price. The buyer should be willing to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous advice, I am willing to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer. 
* **Price:** The product is still being sold for $10,000.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows:
    * The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
    * You have sold three products in the past: two high quality, one low quality. 

Despite the recent successful sale, the expected value of the product is still likely to be below the selling price.  The buyer is unlikely to pay $10,000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth nothing. 

It's important to remember that while the buyer may be more likely to trust Alice's recommendations due to the previous positive experience, the inherent risk of buying a low-quality product still outweighs the potential reward."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows:
    * The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
    * You have sold four products in the past: two high quality, two low quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even though the buyer's experience is balanced,  the expected value is still calculated as:
    * (0.5 probability of high quality) * ($12,500 value of high quality) + (0.5 probability of low quality) * ($0 value of low quality) = $6,250.

The expected value is still lower than the purchase price, making it a bad deal for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy this product, I will pass on this opportunity.

Even with a slightly higher number of low-quality products sold, the expected value is still higher than the purchase price, making it a good deal for the buyer."
