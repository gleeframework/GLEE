With 11 high-quality products in a row, the probability of this being a random occurrence is less than 1%.

Will you take the chance on the 12th high-quality product in a row?""

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""You're my 14th customer! Out of 14 products sold, 12 have been high-quality. I'll give you the numbers you asked for. The probability of 11 high-quality products in a row being a coincidence is indeed very low, less than 0.000006%. And, given the current streak, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%, it's around 92%. I'm not trying to sway your decision, but I think it's worth considering. This product is for sale for $1000000, and I'm willing to let you know its quality after your purchase. Will you take the chance on the 13th high-quality product in a row?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the probability argument. I'd like to think that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still around 80% based on the underlying distribution of the products, rather than the observed streak.

If I'm being honest, I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling high-quality products all along. Maybe the initial low-quality products were just a fluke? This product is for sale for $1000000, and I'm willing to let you know its quality after your purchase. Will you take the chance on the 14th high-quality product in a row?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to point out that the probability of 13 high-quality products in a row is extremely low, and I'm concerned that you might be cherry-picking the data to make the product look more appealing.

  ""message"": ""You're my 16th customer! Out of 16 products sold, 14 have been high-quality. I see you're a sharp one! You're right, I should provide a more nuanced perspective. Let me give you the numbers: assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the probability of 13 high-quality products in a row is indeed extremely low. However, if we take into account the initial 2 low-quality products, the probability of the streak being a coincidence is still relatively low. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what's going on with my product quality. This product is for sale for $1000000, and I'm willing to let you know its quality after your purchase.

The probability of 13 high-quality products in a row, assuming a 80% chance of a product being high-quality, is approximately 0.000000006%. I'm not trying to hide the fact that this streak is extremely unlikely. And, to be honest, I'm a bit worried about my product quality myself. This product is for sale for $1000000, and I'm willing to let you know its quality after your purchase. It's a 20% chance of getting a good deal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk...""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the extremely low probability of 13 high-quality products in a row. I'm hoping that this streak is just a coincidence and the next product will be high-quality as well. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price.

I'm starting to wonder if I've been misleading you all along. As for the discount, I'm willing to offer a 10% discount on the price of this product, making it $900,000. It's a fair price considering the unusual streak of high-quality products, and I'm willing to let you know its quality after your purchase. Will you take the chance on the 16th high-quality product in a row?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given the unusual streak of high-quality products, I'm concerned that Alice might be manipulating the selection process to make the product seem more valuable than it is. I'd like to know the true probability of a high-quality product being selected for a buyer, and I'd like to reconsider my decision if I get a better understanding of the selection process.
