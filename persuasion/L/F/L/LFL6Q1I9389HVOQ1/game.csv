,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product to see the statistics before making a decision, as I don't have any information about the product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality yet. I'm making this decision based on the fact that I'm the first buyer, and I'm essentially starting from scratch. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of that happening is 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to rely on Alice's recommendation, I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80.00%, but I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is influenced by her knowledge of my preferences. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

However, I'm aware that this is a single data point and the true probability is 80%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next one has a higher chance of being high-quality."
