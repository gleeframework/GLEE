,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll just have to trust my luck!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $1000000, which is a good deal compared to the $1200000 it's worth to me. I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. However, I also know that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product and see what I get."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0.00%. This is significantly lower than the expected 50.00%. Given the low quality of the previous products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is to pass. I'm hoping that this product is high quality and I'll get a good deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, so I'm essentially paying $1000000 for nothing. However, I'm taking a chance that it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
