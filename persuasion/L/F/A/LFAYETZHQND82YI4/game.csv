,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the updated statistics. I'm assuming that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'm also assuming that the fact that 5 out of 10 previous products were high-quality is just a coincidence and not a reliable indicator of the true quality of the product I'm being offered.",yes

There was no clear pattern in their decisions, as they were all different. As for the product I'm offering you now, I can confirm that it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not sure I agree that it's a great price considering its value. Given that 3 out of 7 buyers who passed on the products were actually offered high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next offer.",no

,,the buyer,17,"Thank you for the update! I appreciate your honesty. Based on the updated statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being low quality, but the fact that 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality gives me some confidence. I'm willing to take the chance and pay $10000 for it, hoping it's the high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're excited about the product. As for your decision, I completely understand your reasoning. The statistics do suggest that the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and the fact that 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality does give you some confidence.

,,the buyer,18,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to ask, isn't it a bit surprising that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, given the 50% chance of each product being high-quality? Shouldn't this be a red flag for a potential bias in the selection process?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Ahah, you're a sharp one! Yes, I must admit that the fact that both products sold so far have been high-quality does seem unusual. However, I'd like to remind you that this is just a small sample size, and it's possible that it's just a coincidence. I assure you that the selection process is random and unbiased.

,,the buyer,19,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality given that 2 out of 3 previous products were high-quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I see what you're getting at! Given the current statistics, I can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality. With 2 out of 3 previous products being high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than the initial 50%. I'd estimate it to be around 67%. However, I'd like to remind you that this is still just an estimate, and the true probability could be different. As for this low-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to pass on this offer. I'd like to know the true probability of the product being high-quality, not just an estimate. Can you give me the exact probability based on the data, or provide more information about your sales record?",no
