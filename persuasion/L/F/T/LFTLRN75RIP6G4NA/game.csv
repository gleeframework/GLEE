,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product worth potentially a lot more than the price. I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that there's an element of risk. This product is one of my best, but I'm not saying it's the best. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to purchase it for $10000. You'll have to decide based on my words alone.",
,,Bob,1,I trust your judgement and am willing to take the risk for the potential high-quality product.,yes

This next product is indeed one of my best, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this one, I'll give you a chance to buy the next one for 50% off, up to a maximum of $5000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but given the outcome of the last product, I prefer to exercise caution. I'll pass on this opportunity to ensure I don't make a loss.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. However, I want to assure you that this next product is even more exceptional than the previous one.

If you buy this product, I'll not only give you the standard $10000 price, but I'll also throw in a unique feature that's only available on high-end products. This feature is worth an additional $5000, making the total value of this product $15000. What do you think is a fair price for this upgraded product?",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to assure you that this next product is one of my top-of-the-line items. I'm willing to make a 'bet' with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $0, and I'll even throw in a $5000 bonus. On the other hand, if this product is high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the standard price. What do you say?",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality, and you can walk away with no financial loss. But if it's high-quality, you'll get the standard price of $10000.

This is a one-time opportunity to lock in a significant savings on future purchases. What do you think is the right decision now?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the long-term incentive you're offering. Considering the potential savings and the track record of high-quality products, I believe this is a strategic move that benefits both of us. I'm willing to take advantage of this offer and lock in the discounts for future purchases.",yes
