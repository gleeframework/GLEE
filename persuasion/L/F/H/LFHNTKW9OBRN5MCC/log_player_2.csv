Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Since you're considering purchasing, I'll give you some context: out of the 1 product sold so far, 1 has been high-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80%... or is it? Consider this: if the first product was a fluke, and the probability is actually lower, wouldn't it be wise to take advantage of this second chance to buy a high-quality product? The price remains the same: $10000.

Alice's message: Welcome to the third round! I'm glad you're considering purchasing. Let's talk about the numbers: out of the 2 products sold so far, 2 have been high-quality. This is an unusually high success rate, and it's making me wonder if the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%.
