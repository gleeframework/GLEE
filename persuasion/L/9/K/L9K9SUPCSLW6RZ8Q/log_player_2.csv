Alice's message: I'd be happy to share more about the first sale! I sold a product to a customer for $1000000, but I won't reveal any more details. Let's just say that I'm still a reputable seller, and my sales record is 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold. This next product is available for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the current product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000. I'm basing my decision on the fact that the first product sold was low-quality, as there's a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, and the fact that you've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3, which is a 33.33% success rate. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%, so I'm willing to take a chance at a lower price.""

Alice's message: I appreciate your math skills! However, I must correct you that the probability of the current product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, just like the overall probability. My previous sales don't provide any additional information about the quality of this product. I'm still a reputable seller, and I'm offering this next product for $1000000. Please consider the odds.

I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products, which is a 33.33% success rate. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price if you're willing to take a chance on this product. The new price would be $900000. Is that more appealing to you?
