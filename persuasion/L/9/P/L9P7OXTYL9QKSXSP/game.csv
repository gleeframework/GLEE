,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the exception."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping that this one will be the exception."

,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation. I've calculated that the probability of the product being high quality is around 33.33%, which is the same as the initial probability. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the previous 5 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. This suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the previous sales record. How many high-quality products were sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if it's a high-quality product or a low-quality product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. However, I'd like to ask, is it possible that you're not recommending high-quality products because you're trying to get rid of the low-quality ones first?"

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm starting to think that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
