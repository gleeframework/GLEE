,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any prior information to go by, so I'll just go with my initial instinct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer, and I know that the first buyer passed on the product, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $100, hoping it's a high-quality product worth $300."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given Alice's recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation to not buy, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product as well."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to maximize her sales. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any more information to share about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure I trust Alice's recommendation based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
