"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significantly higher than the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). Since we don't have any other information about this particular product, it's best to trust Alice's recommendation and take a chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Potential reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is still very high ($20,000).

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record:** While Alice has a good history (1 out of 2), the last round was a failure. 
* **Potential reward:** The potential reward is still high, but the risk of losing $10,000 is now more apparent.

```

**Explanation:**
