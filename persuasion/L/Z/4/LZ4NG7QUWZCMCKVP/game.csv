,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the first product, as I have no information to go by."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not going to buy it yet. I want to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the current statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm not confident in buying it, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one. If I were to buy it, I'd be betting that it's high-quality, but given the 50% chance of it being low-quality, I'd be risking $100 for $0 value. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a better chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far are low-quality. I'll pass on this one to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous two buyers were willing to buy, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the previous sales record. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product, so I'll pass on it."
