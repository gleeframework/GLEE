,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation was based on the previous buyer's decision and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't have any data to go on. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the third buyer, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a final decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This means the probability of the product being high quality is 0/3, which is 0. I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that none have been sold yet."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
