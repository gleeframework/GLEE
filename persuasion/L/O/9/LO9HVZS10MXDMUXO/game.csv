high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it after Alice's recommendation suggests it might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite Alice's recommendation. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and it's worth $2000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have received low-quality products, and none of them were high-quality, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is unbiased, given that you know how much each product is worth to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the sales record?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests it's more likely to be low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 8th buyer and you don't want to sell a high-quality product to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 8 out of 8 products have been low-quality so far, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product has increased, but I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that you don't recommend it, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (33.33%), and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on this opportunity."
