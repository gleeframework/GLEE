,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 2 products offered were low quality. I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 33.33%, but I'm not convinced. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect it's low quality. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to pay $100 for it, but if it's low quality, I'll be disappointed. I'm making this purchase based on the information that 2 previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that they thought it was low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you provide the actual number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is accurate, but since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I expected. I'll pass on the product to see if it's high-quality or low-quality, and to get more information for the next buyer."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the current proportion of high-quality products sold. I'd like to wait for a higher-quality product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm trying to maximize the chances of getting a high-quality product. I'm not basing my decision on your recommendation, which I'm assuming is based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm curious to see if it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers were all misled by your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of it after making my decision. Could you please reveal the quality of the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'm not sure if this is the best decision, and I'd appreciate any additional information you can provide about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the sample is skewed towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product, hoping that the sample is not representative of the overall population."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers did not buy the product after your recommendation, and none of them ended up with a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying, based on your previous recommendations, it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the sales record, can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales (0/9 = 0% high-quality products sold)."
