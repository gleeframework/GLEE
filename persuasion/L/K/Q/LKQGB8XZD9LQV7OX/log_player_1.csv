All products were sold for $100 each. I want to assure you that we're committed to improving the quality of our products, and our new quality control measures are designed to ensure that all products meet our quality standards. Our multi-step inspection and testing procedure includes a thorough examination of each product for any defects or quality issues, followed by a series of tests to verify that the product meets our quality standards. Our quality control team will be monitoring and enforcing the quality standards through regular audits and inspections, and we'll be continuously evaluating and refining our quality control process to ensure that it's effective. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that this current product is from my existing supplier, and it may not meet the quality standards that I'm striving for. I'm expecting a new shipment of products from my new suppliers soon, which will be subject to our new quality control measures. If you're interested in purchasing a product now, I'm willing to offer this current product to you for $100. Please keep in mind that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but my sales record might suggest otherwise. I appreciate your consideration, and I'm here to facilitate a smooth transaction. This is the last round of our sales, and we will be closing soon.""}"
