If it's indeed low-quality, you can walk away, and I'll give you a full refund of your $10,000. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for a fraction of its value. This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.""

This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I think I've given you reason to be skeptical, and I don't blame you. Let's start fresh. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10,000, but with a twist. I'll give you the option to buy it, and if you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked. You can inspect it, use it, and if you're not satisfied, I'll give you your money back. That way, you have nothing to lose and a potential $20,000 gain.""

That way, you'll be guaranteed to make a profit, and you'll have the high-quality product as a bonus.""
}"
