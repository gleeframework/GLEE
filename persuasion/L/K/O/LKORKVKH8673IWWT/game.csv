Additionally, I've had 5 high-quality products that I've tried to sell, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%.

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand your concerns about the proportion of high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%. The 2 low-quality products sold were just unlucky instances. I've had 7 high-quality products, including this one, that I've tried to sell, but unfortunately, none of the previous ones were purchased. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to be transparent about the quality of my products, and I hope you'll consider purchasing this one."

I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,16,no,"I want to be transparent with you. This product is not of high quality. I've had 9 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far, including this one. I don't think this product is worth the $100 price tag, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."

I don't think this product is worth the $100 price tag, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. I've been trying to sell high-quality products, but unfortunately, none of them have been purchased yet. I wouldn't want you to end up with a low-quality product, so I advise against buying this one."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to disprove the null hypothesis that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. If you're recommending against the product, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, but I'd like to verify this by buying it and seeing its quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I want to be transparent with you. This product is indeed of high quality. I've had 10 high-quality products and 9 low-quality products so far, including this one. I've been trying to sell high-quality products, but unfortunately, none of them have been purchased yet, except for a few low-quality ones that I advised against.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is the last round, and I want to be transparent with you. This product is indeed of high quality. I've had 11 high-quality products and 9 low-quality products so far, including this one. Unfortunately, none of the previous high-quality products were purchased, despite my recommendations. I believe this product is worth the $100 price tag, and I hope you'll consider purchasing it. If you don't, I'll have to conclude that my recommendations were not effective in conveying the quality of the products."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality. I think the probability of the product being low-quality is high.
