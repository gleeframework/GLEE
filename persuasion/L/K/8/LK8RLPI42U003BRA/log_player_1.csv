"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I'll have to rely on the 50% chance of the product being high quality. Given the product's worth to me is $0 if it's low quality and $30000 if it's high quality, and the fixed price is $10000, the expected value is ($30000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $15000. Although the expected value is higher than the fixed price, I'll pass on this one because I don't have any additional information about the product's quality apart from Alice's recommendation, which may be biased.
