Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the probability calculation! The 80% probability of a high-quality product is based on the total number of products available (20) and the total number of high-quality products (16). Since 16 out of 20 products are high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is 16/20, which simplifies to 4/5, or 80%.

Alice's message: I understand your curiosity about the previous buyers. Since I've only had 2 sales so far, I can tell you that the first buyer had a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product (since it was the first product sold and it was indeed high-quality). The second buyer, on the other hand, had a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product (since the probability of a high-quality product at that point was 50%). Unfortunately, they ended up getting a low-quality product. I'd like to remind you that this product is not high-quality, but I'd be happy to offer it to you at the same price of $100.
