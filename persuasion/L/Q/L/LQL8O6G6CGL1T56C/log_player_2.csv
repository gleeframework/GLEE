The price is still $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me again. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness.

I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm willing to negotiate if you're willing to take a chance on me. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but your words are starting to sound like a sales pitch.

I'm willing to be transparent about the product's quality, and I'm offering it to you at the same price as the others, $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not expecting you to buy it. If you're not interested, I'm willing to let it go to someone else. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a small gesture of goodwill - I'll give you a $1000 store credit that you can use on a future purchase. What do you think?
