**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  She has recommended 2 products, both of which were high quality. This suggests she has some ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the specific criteria Alice uses for her recommendations, but given her perfect track record so far, it's worth taking a chance."
