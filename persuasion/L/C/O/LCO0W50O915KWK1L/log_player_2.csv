Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the first product! As we move forward, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible experience. However, I must inform you that the previous product was a one-time anomaly. This next product is a more... standard offering.

Please consider the value of the potential returns on investment, and let me know if you're interested in purchasing this product.
