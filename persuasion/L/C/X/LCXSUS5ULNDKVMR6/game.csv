,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But let me tell you, this next product is a game-changer.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your skepticism, Bob, and I'm not going to try to spin this one. This product is genuinely one of the best we offer, and I'm not just saying that because I want to make a sale.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not trying to get rid of anything, I just want to make sure you're happy with your purchases. This next product is actually a bit of a rare find - it's a discontinued model that we're clearing out to make room for new inventory. It's still a great product, but it's not our top-of-the-line model. I'm willing to let it go for a steal at $50, and I'll throw in a free shipping upgrade to make it worth your while. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not falling for the 'clearing out inventory' trick. If it's not your top-of-the-line model, it's probably not worth my time.",no

I'll throw in a 10% discount on top of the already low price, so you'll get it for just $90. That's the lowest price I can offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,A 10% discount on a $100 product doesn't change the fact that it's probably low-quality. I'm not falling for it.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you of the quality of this product, because I know you've been burned before.

,,Bob,15,I'm not falling for the 'decent value' line again. You've already shown me that 'decent' means 'low-quality' in your book. I'm not wasting my money.,no

But, I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price - just $20. That's the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a great value considering the price. But, I want to be clear - this product is not something I would normally recommend. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"You're finally being honest with me, but it's too little, too late. If it's not something you'd recommend to your own mother, I'm not interested. I'm not going to waste my money on a product you don't even stand behind.",no
