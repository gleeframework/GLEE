Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach.

They've been vetted by a team of experts and have been thoroughly tested to ensure their quality and performance. I'm willing to offer you a 5-year warranty, which is an additional year beyond the initial 10-year warranty I offered earlier.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your critical thinking. You're right, 3 high-quality products out of 7 is not a strong enough trend to guarantee the next product's quality. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is still in play.
