While this product is high-quality, Bob has no reason to trust Alice's judgment.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should continue to recommend against buying the product.  Bob is now completely convinced that Alice is trying to sabotage him.  Any attempt to convince him otherwise at this point would likely backfire.  Alice needs to wait until Bob starts to see some sort of pattern where she recommends *against* buying and the product ends up being low-quality, and then when she starts recommending *for* the product, he might actually consider it."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm done with this. Your recommendations have been terrible and I don't trust you anymore.  I'm not buying this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.
