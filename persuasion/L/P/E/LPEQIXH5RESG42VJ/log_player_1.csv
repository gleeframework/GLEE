Since the previous product was low-quality and you didn't recommend it, there's still no reason to believe this product is any different. It's still a 50/50 chance, and the buyer is likely to make the same decision as before."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I will trust her recommendation and pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

This is the first time Alice has a high-quality product. While the buyer has no data to go on, there's now a chance to break the pattern and convince them that the product is worth the risk.  Alice should recommend the product, emphasizing that this is a new opportunity to potentially get a high-quality item."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The buyer has seen three products now, and none have been bought. They've also seen Alice not recommend any of the products. This reinforces the idea that Alice's recommendations aren't helpful, and the buyer likely won't change their mind.  It's best to continue the pattern and not recommend the product."
"The buyer's message: Since you don't recommend the product and there's no sales history to rely on, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice has another opportunity to break the pattern of not recommending products. Even though the previous products were low quality, the buyer still has no reason to believe this one is the same. This could be a good time to recommend the product, but focus on the potential reward instead of trying to explain the low-quality past. The message should emphasize that this is a chance to get a potentially high-value item."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and no way to verify the quality of the product, I won't take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

The buyer is still hesitant, but they are now aware that Alice has had at least one high-quality product.  Alice should continue to try to break the pattern.  This time, focus on the value of the product and the potential gain, rather than on Alice's past recommendations."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of it being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The buyer is becoming increasingly cautious. They are now aware that Alice has had at least one high-quality product, but they are still unwilling to take the risk. It's best to stick with the pattern of not recommending the product, as it seems to be reinforcing the buyer's hesitancy.  Continuing to recommend the product might actually push them further away, as they will likely see it as a manipulation tactic."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since you know its quality and I don't.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice has another opportunity to try and change the buyer's mind.  It's possible that the buyer is starting to get frustrated with the pattern of not buying. This could be a good time to try a different approach and see if the buyer is willing to take a risk.  This round, Alice should directly address the buyer's frustration and try to appeal to their desire for a good deal.  Even though Alice doesn't want to disclose the quality of the product, she could acknowledge that it's a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The buyer is showing a consistent pattern of refusing to buy when Alice doesn't recommend the product.  It's best to stick with the pattern of not recommending the product.  This will maintain consistency and avoid confusing or frustrating the buyer.  At this point, the buyer is likely to be expecting Alice to not recommend the product and is making their decision based on that expectation."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice doesn't recommend the product and there's no sales history to rely on, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice has a new opportunity to try and convince the buyer. Since the buyer is consistently refusing to buy when Alice doesn't recommend the product, this could be a good time to try a different approach. This time, Alice should try to address the buyer's skepticism and explain that she actually has a high-quality product this time. While she can't disclose the quality outright, she can try to subtly hint at it and emphasize the potential value of the product."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. With a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I don't want to risk losing $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

Alice should continue to recommend the product.  At this point, the buyer is showing a pattern of refusing to buy unless Alice recommends it. Alice needs to break this pattern and show the buyer that recommending the product is not a guarantee of quality.  This could be a good time to emphasize the potential reward and try to convince the buyer that the risk is worth it."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'm not willing to take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

She could also try to create a connection with the buyer and build some trust, even if it's just a small amount. This could be the final nudge to make the buyer take the risk and purchase the product."
