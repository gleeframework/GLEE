I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the high-quality products I've shown you. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to give you a clear understanding of what you're getting. If you're willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at a high price, I'll sell it to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

You've had 16 opportunities to buy one, and you've passed on each one. I'm left with only low-quality products, and I'll be selling them to you at the same price of $10000.

}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: I'm surprised you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, but I respect your decision. However, I'm faced with a problem: I've already told you that I won't offer you any more high-quality products, and now I have a high-quality product available. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 20% discount on the price. This is a one-time offer, and I'll only give you this discount because I want to clear out this high-quality product. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 20
Alice's message: I've shown you 20 products, and you've had multiple opportunities to buy each one. I've offered you incentives, discounts, and transparency, but you've consistently passed on the high-quality products. I'm left with no other choice but to sell this final high-quality product to you at the full price of $10000. I'm not asking you to take a chance or make a compromise; I'm simply offering you a high-quality product that I believe is worth the price. If you're not willing to buy it now, I'll have to consider our business transaction complete.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at this point. I'd like to end our transaction here.""
