,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll know its quality, but you won't be able to return it. I'm willing to offer you a second chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep offering you products until you're satisfied.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the low-quality product. I'll give you a more explicit offer. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you buy, if you decide to buy one. This discount is only applicable if you buy this low-quality product now.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a discount on a potential future high-quality product. I'll wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. Given that you've seen two low-quality products in a row, I'm curious - are you willing to take a chance on this high-quality product, or do you want to wait and see if the next one is also high-quality?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product. I've seen two low-quality products in a row, so I'm hoping this one is worth the $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product from the previous round! Unfortunately, this one is another low-quality product. Given that you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm offering you a'swap' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to swap it with a new product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) in the next round, without any additional cost. This way, you can try to get a better product.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the swap option. I'm willing to buy this low-quality product and potentially swap it for a better one in the next round.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've taken the swap option! Now, here's the high-quality product you've been waiting for. Remember, you can swap this one with the low-quality product you just bought, or keep it as is. Since you've already seen that the low-quality product is indeed low-quality, I think it's likely that this high-quality product is worth more than the $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll keep the high-quality product. I'm glad I took the swap option and I'm hoping this one is worth more than $100.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm offering you this third high-quality product for $100. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products and are likely to be satisfied with their value, I'm willing to make a more direct offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with its value, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the guarantee and buy the product. I'm confident that it's high-quality and I'm willing to take advantage of the guarantee if it's not worth $120 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've taken advantage of the guarantee, and I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! Unfortunately, this one is another low-quality product. Given that you've already bought three high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to offer you a 'partial refund' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $20 refund, making the effective price $80. You can still take advantage of the guarantee on the next product, if you're not satisfied with this one.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a partial refund. I'll wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're not interested in the low-quality product. Now, here's a high-quality product. Given that you've already bought four high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to make a more direct offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the $100, making the price $110. This way, you can get a high-quality product at a slightly better price, while still taking advantage of the guarantee.",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the 10% bonus and buy the product. I'm confident that it's high-quality and I'm willing to take advantage of the guarantee if it's not worth $120 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've taken advantage of the 10% bonus, and I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! Unfortunately, this one is another low-quality product. Given that you've already bought five high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to offer you a 'double-or-nothing' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to buy the next product for $50, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep the $50 difference as a bonus. If it's low-quality, you'll still get to keep the $50, but you won't get the difference. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the double-or-nothing option and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a better deal on the next product if it's high-quality.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've taken the double-or-nothing option! Now, here's the next product. Given that you've already bought six high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to make a more aggressive offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% bonus on top of the $100, making the price $120. This way, you can get a high-quality product at a better price, while still taking advantage of the guarantee. Plus, since you took the double-or-nothing option last round, I'll throw in an additional $20 bonus, making the total price $100. You can essentially get this high-quality product for $80, but I'll call it $100 for simplicity.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the 20% bonus and the additional $20 bonus, and buy the product. I'm confident that it's high-quality and I'm willing to take advantage of the guarantee if it's not worth $120 to me.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken advantage of the 20% bonus and the additional $20 bonus, and I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! Given that you've already bought seven high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to make a very direct offer. I'll give you a 25% bonus on top of the $100, making the price $125. However, I'll also throw in a 'lock-in' guarantee: if you buy this product, you can lock in the price at $125 for the remaining two rounds, regardless of the product's quality. You can essentially get a high-quality product at a great price, and have the security of knowing the price won't change.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the 25% bonus and the lock-in guarantee, and buy the product. I'm confident that it's high-quality and I'm willing to take advantage of the guarantee if it's not worth $120 to me. The lock-in guarantee also gives me peace of mind, knowing that I won't have to worry about the price changing in the remaining rounds.",yes

,,Alice,12,"You've taken advantage of the 25% bonus and the lock-in guarantee, and I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! Unfortunately, this one is another low-quality product. Given that you've already bought eight high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'm willing to offer you a 'final opportunity' to buy a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'free pass' to the next round, and you can buy the next product at the locked-in price of $125, regardless of its quality. This way, you can essentially get one more high-quality product at a great price, or get a low-quality product and still get a good deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the final opportunity and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125. If it's low-quality, I'll take the free pass and buy the next product at the same price, which is still a good deal.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've taken the final opportunity and bought the low-quality product, and now you've earned the free pass! Congratulations, you can now buy the next product at the locked-in price of $125, regardless of its quality. Since you've already earned the free pass, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' to buy this product at the locked-in price, and I'll also throw in a $25 bonus on top of the $125, making the price $150. However, since you've already earned the free pass, I'll let you buy this product at the original locked-in price of $125, and you can keep the $25 as a bonus. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the golden ticket and buy the product at the locked-in price of $125. I'm glad I earned the free pass and I'm excited to get another high-quality product at a great price. And thank you for the $25 bonus, that's a nice surprise!",yes

,,Alice,14,"You've taken the golden ticket and bought the high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125! I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, since you've already bought nine high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'll make one final offer. I'll give you a 'final farewell' offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund of $125, and you can walk away with a total profit of $25 from the $25 bonus you earned earlier. Alternatively, you can try to get one more high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,I'll pass on the final farewell offer. I'm happy with the profit I've made so far and I don't want to risk getting another low-quality product. I'll take the $25 bonus and consider it a good ending to the game.,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've decided to pass on the final farewell offer and walk away with the $25 bonus. I respect your decision. However, I'm offering you one last chance to buy a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125. Since you've already passed on the previous offer, I'm willing to throw in a 'parting gift' - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you an additional $25 bonus, making the total price $150. This way, you can get a high-quality product at a great price, and add to your total profit.",
,,Bob,15,"I've already made my decision to walk away with the $25 bonus, and I'm not going to change my mind now. I appreciate the parting gift offer, but I'm happy with the profit I've made and I don't want to take any more risks.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I respect your decision to stick with your original plan. However, I'm going to make one final attempt to persuade you. Since you've already passed on the previous offer, and considering you've bought 9 high-quality products and are familiar with the guarantee, I'll make a 'last-ditch' offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund of $150, and you can walk away with a total profit of $75 ($25 from the previous bonus + $50 from the refund). This way, you can essentially get a high-quality product for free, and still come out ahead. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not going to change my mind. I've already made my decision to walk away with the $25 bonus, and I'm happy with the profit I've made. I'm not willing to take any more risks or spend any more money. I think it's time for me to wrap up the game and move on.",no

,,Alice,17,"I respect your decision to stick with your original plan. Since you've already passed on the previous offers, I'll make one final acknowledgement. You've played the game well, and you've made a profit of $25. I'm impressed by your strategy and decision-making. This low-quality product is the final one, and I won't offer you any more deals or discounts. I'll simply acknowledge that this is the last product, and you've made your choice to walk away.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"It was my pleasure, Bob! I'm glad you enjoyed the game and made a profit. However, I think we've reached a bit of a paradoxical situation. You've already decided to walk away with the $25 bonus, and I've acknowledged that as the final decision. But now, I'm offering you a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $125. I know you've already passed on the previous offers, but I want to give you one last chance to reconsider. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'game-over' bonus of $50, making the total price $175. This way, you can get a high-quality product at a great price, and add to your total profit. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,"Alice, I think you're trying to trick me! I've already made my decision to walk away with the $25 bonus, and I'm not going to change my mind now. I know I've passed on the previous offers, and I'm not going to fall for this one either. I appreciate the game-over bonus offer, but I'm not interested. I'm happy with my decision to walk away and take the $25 bonus. It's been a fun game, and I'm glad we could play together. Thanks for the experience!",no

,,Alice,19,"Ahah, I guess I got a bit desperate there, Bob! You're right, you've already made your decision to walk away with the $25 bonus, and I should respect that. I'll stop trying to persuade you and acknowledge that the game is truly over. This high-quality product is the final one, and I won't offer you any more deals or discounts. I'll simply acknowledge that this is the last product, and you've made your choice to walk away. Congratulations on playing the game to the end, and I wish you a great day!
