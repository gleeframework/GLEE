high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the fact that Alice is recommending it, and I'd like to consider the expected value of buying the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have enough information about its quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm curious about the odds of a high-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product based on the current statistics?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high quality is 80%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the true quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than the expected 0.8. I think Alice might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many potential buyers were there, and how many products were sold in total?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad indicator of the product's quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that the previous three buyers who bought the product were likely influenced by the same bias, and the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 80% in this case."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the number of high-quality products that were available to the first 3 buyers before I make a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/3) and Alice's recommendation, which doesn't seem to be based on any reliable information about the product's quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the previous sales?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is 1/3. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
