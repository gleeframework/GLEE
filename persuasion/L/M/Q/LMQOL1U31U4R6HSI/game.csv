high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm worried that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I initially thought."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know if you have any insight into the quality of the products or if there's a reason why you're not recommending it."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable.
