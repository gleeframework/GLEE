Would you like to buy the current product?","Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information about the seller's history of recommending high-quality products. Given the probabilities, I'll make a decision based on the expected value of the product.

The expected value is calculated as (probability of high quality) * (value of high quality) + (probability of low quality) * (value of low quality). In this case, it's (1/3) * $12,000 + (2/3) * $0 = $4,000.

Since the expected value ($4,000) is less than the price of the product ($10,000), I will decide not to buy the product.
