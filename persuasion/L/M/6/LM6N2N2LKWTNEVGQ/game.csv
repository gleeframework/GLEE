high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and there's no data to go by. I'd like to pass and see what happens to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the initial statistics, and I'd like to see the statistics updated after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to understand your recommendation. Can you explain why you think this product is worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the high probability of it being low quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since none of the previous products were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope to get a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and ended up not buying, and that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might indicate that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on something worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 out of 2 products being sold so far, and none of them being high-quality, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 attempt, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation alone, considering the low success rate so far."
