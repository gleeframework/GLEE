high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products recommended to buy so far have been low-quality. Therefore, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and the recommendation. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 products recommended by you have been low quality, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for the next product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall proportion.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them ended up buying a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were all low-quality.
