Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 80.00%, but since 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Given that Alice recommends it, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the limited information, I don't have enough data to make an informed decision.
