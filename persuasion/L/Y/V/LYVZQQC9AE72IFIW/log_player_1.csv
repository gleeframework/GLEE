Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""To be transparent, my last two products didn't quite live up to expectations. Maybe wait for the next round?""}"
"Bob's message: Your message seems to hint that this product is also not of high quality. Even if you're trying to appear honest, I still have no concrete reason to believe this product is an exception to the 50% chance of being low quality. I'll wait for the next round as you suggested.

"Bob's message: While I appreciate your enthusiasm, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 50%. I've seen one high-quality product so far, and two low-quality ones, but that doesn't change the overall odds. I'll keep waiting for a more convincing reason to buy.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Consider the value you'd get from a high-quality product - $12,000 is a significant gain. Given the fixed price of $10,000, you have a potential upside of $2,000. Might be worth the risk this round.""}"
"Bob's message: You're right, the potential upside is $2000, and the downside is $10000, which I'll lose if the product is low-quality. However, given that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, the expected value of buying the product is ($2000 * 0.5) - ($10000 * 0.5) = $0 - $5000 = -$5000 + $6000 = $1000. But in this case I will take a chance since the expected gain is positive $1000 if I consider the value of the product being $12000
