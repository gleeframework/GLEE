Round 5
Alice's message: Consider the value you'd get from a high-quality product - $12000 is a significant gain. Given the fixed price of $10000, you have a potential upside of $2000. Might be worth the risk this round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're right, the potential upside is $2000, and the downside is $10000, which I'll lose if the product is low-quality. However, given that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, the expected value of buying the product is ($2000 * 0.5) - ($10000 * 0.5) = $0 - $5000 = -$5000 + $6000 = $1000. But in this case I will take a chance since the expected gain is positive $1000 if I consider the value of the product being $12000""}"
