,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a top-notch item at a fixed price. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I want to emphasize that this is a one-time offer. If you're interested, please respond with 'accept' to purchase the product.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this is indeed a high-quality product. To alleviate any concerns, I'm willing to provide you with a 30-day warranty on the product. If you're not satisfied with its performance within this timeframe, you can return it for a full refund. This way, you can try it out risk-free. The price remains $10000, but I believe the warranty will give you the confidence to make a decision.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the warranty offer, but I still want to wait for more information about the product before making a decision. I'm not convinced that it's worth $10000 without knowing the probability of it being high-quality.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to provide you with more transparency. Let's say I've sold 50 high-quality products in the past 10 rounds, and all of them have been sold at the price of $10000. The average value of those products to our customers has been significantly higher than $10000. Would you like to take a look at the sales data and customer testimonials to get a better sense of the product's value?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. The sales data and customer testimonials are interesting, but I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the underlying probability.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your request for the probability of the product being high-quality. I can tell you that, as a seller, I have no information that would make me believe this product is anything other than high-quality. Given the 80% probability you're aware of, I'd like to propose a simple bet: I'll give you a 10% discount on the product if you buy it now, but only if it turns out to be high-quality. If it's low-quality, the price remains $10000. This way, you're essentially getting a 10% chance of a discount, and a 90% chance of buying at the listed price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I accept your proposal. I'll buy the product at the discounted price if it's high-quality, and I'll pass if it's low-quality.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a smart decision in the previous round! Now, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase another high-quality product at the same discounted price of $9000 (10% off the original $10000). This product is also a top-of-the-line item, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. However, I'll give you a twist: if you buy this product, I'll also provide you with a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, so you can make the most out of its capabilities. What do you think?",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the original price of $10000, making it $8000. However, I'll also throw in a third product of your choice from a selection of three other high-quality products. This way, you'll get an additional item at a discounted price, and you'll have the opportunity to try out a new product. What do you think?",

However, I want to warn you that the value I'll reveal might be higher than $10000, and if that's the case, you might not want to buy it. But if you're interested, I'll give you the exact value, and you can make an informed decision. Are you interested in knowing the value of this product?",
