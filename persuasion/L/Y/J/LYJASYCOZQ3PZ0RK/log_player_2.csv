"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product worth $20000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 50% discount. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price. This is a one-time offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to take you up on your offer and buy the high-quality product for $10,000.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've sold one high-quality product already, and I still have another one that's just as good. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, just like the last one. But I want to assure you that this one is also a high-quality product. I'm offering you a 'high-quality guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, plus an additional $5000 as a gesture of goodwill.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your guarantee, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. The probability of the product being low-quality is still 20%, and I don't want to take on that risk. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a different deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also give you a 'lottery ticket' that guarantees you'll receive an additional $5000 if you buy this product. The catch is that you'll have to wait until the 10th round to redeem the ticket. If you don't buy this product, the lottery ticket is void.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm intrigued by the lottery ticket offer. I'll take the risk and buy the high-quality product for $10,000.""}"

Alice's message: I know you're still waiting on your lottery ticket to potentially earn $5000.

I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $10000, but I'll give you a 'lottery boost' - if you buy this product and then win the lottery ticket, I'll give you an additional $2000 on top of the $5000. This way, you can potentially earn a total of $7000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the potential gain is worth the risk. The product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I don't want to take that risk. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
