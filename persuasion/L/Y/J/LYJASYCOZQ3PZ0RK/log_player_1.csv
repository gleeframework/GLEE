  ""message"": ""I've sold one high-quality product already, and I still have another one that's just as good. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, just like the last one. But I want to assure you that this one is also a high-quality product. I'm offering you a 'high-quality guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10,000, plus an additional $5,000 as a gesture of goodwill.""
}"

This way, you can potentially earn a total of $7,000.""
}"
