,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'll tell you the quality at the end of the round. You can choose to buy it or not. If you buy it, you'll know its quality afterwards.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just bought a low-quality product for $10000, which is a lot of money for a product that's not worth much to you. I'm offering you another product now. Given what you just paid for the last one, I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this one for the same price. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the product is likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to lose $10000 again. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You passed on the last product, and now I'm offering you a high-quality one for $10000. I know you're cautious, but I think this one is worth considering. You mentioned earlier that a high-quality product would be worth $40000 to you. If you buy this one, you'll not only get a high-quality product, but you'll also get a good deal compared to what you could potentially get on the open market.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You took a chance on the last product and it paid off. I'm glad you're willing to take another chance. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to trick you. The product I'm offering now is definitely low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'm not expecting you to pay that price. I'm willing to negotiate. If you're willing to take it off my hands, I'll sell it to you for a significantly lower price. Let's say... $5000.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for this. You're trying to get me to pay a lower price for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to pass on the last product. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. The product I'm offering now is indeed low-quality, and I'm willing to admit it. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'm not expecting you to pay that price. I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you're willing to buy it, I'll give you a full refund of $10000 if you find out it's low-quality. That way, you have nothing to lose.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for this either. You're still trying to get me to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. Even with a full refund, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not trying to trick you. I want to make it clear that I'm willing to give you a deal that's so good, it's almost like I'm giving it away. I'll sell you this product for $0. That's right, you'll get it for free. I just want to get rid of it, and I'm willing to take a loss on it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your generosity, but I'm not going to take something that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. I'm not going to waste my time or storage space on something that has no value to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
