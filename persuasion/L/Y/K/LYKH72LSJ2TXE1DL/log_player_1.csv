Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, Alice has revealed it is high-quality. Since the price is fixed, and Bob doesn't know the actual value of a high-quality product, it's always beneficial to buy a high-quality product at a fixed price.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best decision."
