I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.""

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000, but I want to be transparent about the unusual circumstances. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if it's representative of my usual stock.""

  ""message"": ""Three high-quality products out of three sold means that 100% of my products so far are high-quality, which is extremely unlikely given the 80% probability. I think it's safe to say that my sales record has been skewed by chance. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000, but I want to make it clear that there's a high chance it's a low-quality product. You're taking a risk by buying from me at this point.""
}"

If you're looking to buy a high-quality product, I'd advise you to wait for the next round. But if you're looking for a bargain, this might be the opportunity you're looking for.""

The probability of this being a high-quality product is still 80%, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price.""
