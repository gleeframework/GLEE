low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 2nd buyer and I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'll take it."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be high quality since your recommendation is based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I know that out of 3 previous buyers, none of them got a high-quality product. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that you haven't recommended it and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and there's no information on the quality of the products they bought. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is low."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you provide that?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought it, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Since I know that there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, and 3 out of 3 buyers have already passed on the product, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. It seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
