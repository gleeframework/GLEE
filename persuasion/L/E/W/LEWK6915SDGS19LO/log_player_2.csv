Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. As you may have noticed, I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a... let's just say, a 'learning experience'. But don't worry, I've learned from my mistakes and I'm confident that this next product is a real winner. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, which is a 50% success rate. I think that's a great indicator of my quality control process. This product is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $10000. Don't miss out!

Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products, which is still a 33% success rate. I know it's not ideal, but I'm committed to improving my quality control process. This product is still available at the same price of $10000.
