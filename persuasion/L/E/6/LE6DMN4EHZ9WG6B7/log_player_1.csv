Maybe I'm just being cautious, but I think it's more likely that I'm waiting for the right moment to sell a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000. It's a chance to be part of my growth and potentially get a great deal.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not convinced. Since you've yet to sell a product, I'd like to see more evidence that you are actually selling high-quality products. I'll pass on this one for now.

That's a total of $11,000, just for taking a chance on me. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with the deal.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your offer is very compelling. The potential upside with a high-quality product is worth the risk, even with the chance of a low-quality product.  I appreciate the guarantee and will take a chance. Let's do this!

I'm going to make it right by offering you a special deal on the next product. If you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $5,000 on top of the $40,000 value.

I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I think you won't regret it.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, with only 1 product sold and no high-quality products sold so far, I'm still not convinced about the 20% success rate. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before I make a decision.

I think this is a great opportunity to take a chance on me and potentially get a good deal.""}"

I'm also willing to offer you a 'insurance' of sorts - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $2,000 bonus on top of the refund. That way, you'll still get something out of the deal, even if it's not a high-quality product.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not convinced. The statistics show that only 1 out of 9 products sold were high-quality, which is a very low percentage. While your offer of a discount and bonus is appealing, it's not enough to outweigh the significant risk of getting a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.

That way, you'll get something out of the deal, even if it's not a high-quality product.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your statistics and offer are intriguing, but I'm still hesitant. Your initial 20% success rate is well below the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
