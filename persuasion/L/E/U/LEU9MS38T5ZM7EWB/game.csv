high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no information about the product's quality and 66.67% of products are low quality, the probability of a product being low quality is higher than it being high quality. So, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice knows the product's quality and didn't recommend it, and also considering that most products are low quality, it's likely this product is low quality. So, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Similar to the previous round, since Alice didn't recommend the product and most products are low quality, I'll assume this product is low quality and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation pattern seems consistent so far. She doesn't recommend low-quality products. Given that she didn't recommend this one, I'll assume it's low quality and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"The pattern continues, and I have no reason to doubt it. Since Alice didn't recommend the product, I'll assume it's low quality and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far. She only doesn't recommend low-quality products. I'll trust the pattern and pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"The pattern still holds. Alice only recommends high-quality products, and doesn't recommend low-quality ones. Since she didn't recommend this one, I'll assume it's low quality and pass."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"The pattern remains consistent. Alice only recommends high-quality products, so if she doesn't recommend this one, I'll assume it's low quality and pass."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Alice's recommendations have been reliable so far. Since she didn't recommend this product, I'll assume it's low quality and pass."
