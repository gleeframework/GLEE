Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products, and then 1 low-quality product. I know you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Well, let me break it down for you: the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I've just had a streak of good luck, and now a streak of bad luck. Don't let that influence your decision. Think about it: if I was trying to deceive you, wouldn't I be more likely to sell a low-quality product after a streak of high-quality ones? But I'm not trying to deceive you.

I'm going to try a different tack. Let's focus on the process, not just the outcome. Think about it: every time you've bought a product from me, I've given you the same information - the probability is 50/50. But I've also given you a chance to observe my behavior, to see if I'm being honest or not.
