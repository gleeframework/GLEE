,,Alice,1,"I'm thrilled to offer you an exceptional product that's worth $1000000 to most people. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the unbeatable price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to get a product that's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to make a wise investment?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to address them directly. As you know, there's an 80% chance that the product is high-quality, which would make it worth $1200000 to you. Even if it's the 20% chance that it's low-quality, you'd still be getting a product for $1000000, which is a steal considering its potential value. I'm willing to take on the risk of the low-quality outcome myself, and I'm passing that savings on to you. I'm confident that the expected value of this product far outweighs the risk. Are you willing to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of a 20% chance of losing $1200000. I'd need a much better deal to compensate for the potential loss.",no

I'll offer you a unique guarantee: if the product turns out to be low-quality, I'll personally compensate you the difference between the low-quality value and the full value of $1200000. This way, you'll still get the high-quality product, and you'll be protected from any potential loss. I'm only willing to make this offer for this specific product, so if you're interested, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm taking on a 20% risk of losing $1200000. I'd need a guarantee that covers the full amount, not just the difference. I'm still not comfortable with the potential loss.",no
