,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were recommended and both were low quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to deceive me. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I will not buy the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy.

,,Alice,15,no,
