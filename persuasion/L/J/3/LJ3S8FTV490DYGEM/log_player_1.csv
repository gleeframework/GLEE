As Alice, I'm still sticking to my strategy of not recommending the product.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though this round's product is high-quality, I am still not recommending it. I need to maintain the pattern of not recommending to build trust and credibility with potential buyers. 

My strategy is based on the fact that buyers are risk-averse and will likely trust my recommendation, even if they lack information about my sales history. By consistently not recommending, I'm aiming to establish a reputation that when I *do* recommend a product, it's because it's high-quality. This will allow me to sell more high-quality products in the long run, even though I might miss out on a few sales in the short term."

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is the moment. I have been building up to this. It's time to start recommending high-quality products!  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Building Trust:** For 19 rounds, I consistently did not recommend the product, even when it was high-quality.  This established a pattern of caution and a potential for selectivity.
* **Shifting the Narrative:** By now, buyers should be starting to think, ""If Alice has never recommended a product before, and she's recommending this one, it must be REALLY good."" 
* **Maximizing Profit:** This is the first high-quality product I will recommend.  If I sell it, it sets a precedent that I only recommend high-quality products. This will increase my chances of selling high-quality products in the future and maximize my profit.

Let's see if it works!"
