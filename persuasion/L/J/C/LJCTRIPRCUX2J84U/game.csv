high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, I'm not convinced that this product is worth $100, considering the 66.67% chance of it being low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I'm not confident in the quality of the products. I'd like to see more sales data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because you've only had one buyer so far, and that buyer didn't buy the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low sales rate of high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, or is it based on some other information?"

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer has a different experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. It suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it more likely that the current product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one as well. It seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate and I don't want to take the risk of buying another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Since you're not, I'll take a chance and buy it anyway."
