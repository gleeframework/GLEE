low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, since it's the first product and I have no prior information to go by. I'm willing to take the risk of possibly getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of the first buyer, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is a very low probability, and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it, but so far, no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high quality and the potential value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. Is there any information that suggests the product is more likely to be low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your previous recommendations are reliable, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to see the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll buy the product anyway. I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better offer.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Alice, given that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'll pass on this one and hope the next one is better."
