,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you're recommending against the product. Is it because of the low sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might lead her to be overly cautious in her recommendations. I'd like to wait for more information or get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy it, hoping it's one of the few high-quality ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm guessing the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have not been successful and I'm not sure if this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 7th buyer and the previous 6 buyers all passed, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I'm hoping to be the lucky one who gets a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. Since 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, it's likely that the previous buyers were all low-quality products. Given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm hoping to be the one who gets the good one. I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales record of high-quality products, but I'm willing to take the risk and make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have been 0 for high-quality products sold out of 10. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
