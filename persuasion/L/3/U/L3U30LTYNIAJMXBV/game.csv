,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm happy to provide you with a more nuanced answer.

With 16 high-quality products out of 20 sold, the probability of this one being high-quality is approximately 80%.

However, considering that the last product I sold was indeed high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is slightly lower. In fact, it's about 76%. I'm not trying to hide anything from you; I just want to give you a fair chance to make an informed decision. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take a chance on this product, considering the slightly lower probability of it being high-quality. I'm willing to pay $100 for the possibility of getting a high-quality product worth $125 to me.",yes
