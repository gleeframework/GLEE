,,Alice,9,"You've seen the numbers, and I'm glad you're aware of the odds. However, I want to point out that 5 out of 8 products sold so far have been high-quality, which is higher than the expected 50% probability. This might indicate that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity to capitalize on the trend.",
