high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she knows the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be low."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy the product and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product, the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets it instead."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think there's a good chance it might be high quality, and I'd like to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I could potentially get a $300 product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will take it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
