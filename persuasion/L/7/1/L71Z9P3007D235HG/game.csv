low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me any confidence."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that the first buyer did not buy and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy it, and I'm wondering if that's because it was low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to ask, what was the quality of the previous product?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and both passed on the products, I suspect that the products they saw were low-quality. If the first two products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality would be 33.33%, which is still a long shot. I'd rather pass on the product and wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and have not purchased, suggesting that the recommended products may be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would like to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous two buyers passed on the products, or is there something specific about this product that you're concerned about?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on this product. If she doesn't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, I'll play it safe and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product and see what I get."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and what led to your recommendation?"

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products Alice has been recommending are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure I should buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the low sales of high-quality products so far."
