,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information yet and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk again, even though you don't recommend it. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, but I also know that a high-quality product is worth $200000 more than the price I'm paying, so it's still a good deal for me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
