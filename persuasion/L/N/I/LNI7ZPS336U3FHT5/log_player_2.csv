**Reasoning:**

* **The data is limited:** We only have information about one previous sale.
* **The recommendation is positive:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:** Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $200 for a high-quality product makes it worth taking the risk with this small sample size. 

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on limited information and a high-risk/high-reward scenario.  As more data becomes available, the decision might change."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product randomly.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has knowledge about the product quality, recommends buying. This strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100 if the product is low quality, especially with the positive indicators."
