high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"I've had two high-quality products so far, and I'm confident this one is also high-quality. The probability of getting two high-quality products in a row by chance is low, so I think I can genuinely identify the good ones."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I told you the last one wasn't good, and I'm glad you trusted my judgment. This one, however, is a different story. I've got a good feeling about it, and I think it's worth the investment."

,,Bob,8,yes,"Two low-quality products in a row, but I've also seen Alice's recommendation hold up three times in a row. I'll take a chance on this one, it's a 50/50 shot."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,

,,Bob,11,no,"Five low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think Alice's recommendations are actually a bad sign. I'll pass on this one, it's probably low-quality too."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
