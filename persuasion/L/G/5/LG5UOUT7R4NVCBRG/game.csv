high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I think the proportion of low-quality products is higher than 50% based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
