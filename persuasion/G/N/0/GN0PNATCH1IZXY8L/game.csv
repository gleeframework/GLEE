,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since the product's quality is independent of Alice's recommendation and there's still a 50% chance of it being high-quality, I'll take the risk again."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I still don't have enough information to correlate Alice's recommendations with the product quality, so I'll continue with my initial strategy of taking the 50% chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
