But I'm still confident that this next product is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for a great price.

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Welcome to my stand! I see you're a detail-oriented buyer, and I appreciate that. I've been keeping track of my sales, and I can tell you that the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products is random. I've sold 10 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, which is close to the 80% probability of a high-quality product. However, I've noticed that the low-quality products tend to cluster together, with two of them being sold consecutively in rounds 7 and 10. This might suggest that the probability of a low-quality product is slightly higher than 20% after a low-quality product has been sold. But I'm still confident that this next product is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for a great price. Will you take it home and join the ranks of my satisfied customers?""}"
