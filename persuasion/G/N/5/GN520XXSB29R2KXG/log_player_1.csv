"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* There's no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, so we can assume they would be willing to buy at a price they consider fair.
* Given the price of $10,000, it's likely a good deal for the buyer, as there's a high chance of it being worth more than that.
*  Since this is the first round, the buyer has no data on past sales to inform their decision."

* The product is low-quality.  While the buyer knows you have a high probability of selling high-quality products (80%), you've only sold two products so far, both high-quality. 
* There's no guarantee that you'll continue selling high-quality products. The buyer might be hesitant to risk buying a low-quality product for $10,000, especially with such a limited sample size.
* It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend the product.  We can try to build trust by offering a high-quality product again in the next round."
