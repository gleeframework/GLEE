But don't let that discourage you! I'm confident that this product will surprise you. In fact, I'll tell you that I've been told that the next product I sell has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $1000000?

But I'm willing to make a bold statement - I'm going to reveal to you that the next product I sell is definitely high-quality. If you buy this low-quality product now, you'll get a chance to experience the thrill of potentially getting the high-quality product next time. And who knows, you might just get lucky!
