Alice's message: I understand your hesitation! Unfortunately, I don't have a preview option available. But I can tell you that I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. The more products I sell, the more I'll be able to provide you with a better idea of the overall quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?

Alice's message: I completely understand your cautious approach! As I mentioned earlier, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I've sold 1 out of 3 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If you're willing to take the risk, this product is still available for $100. Would you like to take a chance?

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the updated probability! As of now, I've sold 2 out of 4 products, and 0 of them were high-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality remains 33.33%, since the sales record doesn't change the underlying probability. However, it's worth noting that the longer I go without selling a high-quality product, the more likely it is that the next one will be. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
