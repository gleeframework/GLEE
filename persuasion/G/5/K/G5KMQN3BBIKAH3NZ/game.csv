low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer and take the product, even though you don't recommend it. I understand that there is no prior data to go by."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two buyers, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it more likely that the current product is low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process before making my own decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of data and Alice's neutral recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 66.67%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd rather wait for more information or consider other options."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability based on the statistics, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm not sure why you're not recommending it, but I'll take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers have gotten a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products have been mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers all passed on the product, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you don't have enough information?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product probability is high, and I'm taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
