low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which is less than the average number of high-quality products I'm expected to sell. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,1,"Since the price is $100 and there's an 80% chance of the product being high-quality, worth $400 to me, the expected value is 0.8 * $400 = $320. This is greater than the price of $100, so it's a good deal.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 offered, which is a 100% success rate. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, this is above the expected rate. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances, your previous sale was high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 offered, which is a 100% success rate. This is significantly above the expected rate of 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll buy it. With a 100% success rate so far, I'm willing to take the risk, given the potential value of a high-quality product is $400, which is 4 times the price you're offering it for.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 offered, which is a 100% success rate. This is extremely unlikely given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"Your sales record seems suspiciously perfect. Given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, it's highly unlikely that all 3 products sold so far have been high-quality. I suspect that you may be hiding or manipulating information, or that this is just a statistical anomaly that will soon correct itself. I'm not willing to take the risk, so I'll pass on this product.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to offer you a more transparent approach. I'll tell you that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 offered, which is still above the expected rate. However, I'll also give you a heads up that I'm expecting to sell more low-quality products in the future, which will likely bring my success rate back down to the expected 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the current success rate and the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk. I understand that the success rate may decrease in the future, but for now, I'll take the chance.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 offered in the last 2 rounds, which is still significantly above the expected rate. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is about to catch up with me. I'm expecting to sell more low-quality products in the near future, which will likely bring my success rate back down to 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand your caution, but with 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold so far, it seems like the current streak is still going strong. Given the potential value of $400 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 offered in the last 3 rounds, which is extremely unlikely. I think it's time to acknowledge that the law of large numbers has indeed caught up with me. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent that I expect the next few products to be low-quality. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,7,"I understand that the law of large numbers suggests that the next product is more likely to be low-quality, but given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality and the potential value of $400, I believe the risk is worth taking, especially considering the fixed price of $100.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I think I've been lucky so far, and it's time to face the music. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm warning you that I expect the next product to be low-quality. If you buy this one, you're essentially betting that I've been lucky for too long, and it's time for the law of large numbers to catch up.",
,,the buyer,8,"I understand your skepticism, but the probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, regardless of your past luck. I'll take my chances.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products in a row, which is an absurdly high streak. I'm not going to pretend that I'm not due for a correction. In fact, I'm expecting a low-quality product next, and I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm warning you that I'm essentially a ticking time bomb of low-quality products.",
,,the buyer,9,"I understand your concerns about being due for a correction, but the probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%. Your honesty is appreciated, but I'll take the chance given the odds and potential value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've finally sold a low-quality product, which was inevitable given the law of large numbers. I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and I'm glad I could finally correct my streak. This product is available for $100, and I'm not trying to hide anything. It's a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you at the same price as the high-quality ones.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given that the product is of low quality and has no value to me, I will pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm starting to think I'm just really good at selling high-quality products. But let's be real, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm not trying to hide anything. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take it. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, which makes it a worthwhile investment given the potential value of $400.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm starting to feel like I'm defying the odds. But I'm not going to pretend that I'm not due for another correction. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm warning you that the law of large numbers is still waiting to catch up with me.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take my chances. Although the law of large numbers suggests that a low-quality product is overdue, each product's quality is independent of the others. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product and the potential $300 profit, I believe the odds are in my favor.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm starting to think I've got a good thing going. But let's not forget, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a hot streak. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to jinx it, but... yeah, let's just say I'm feeling optimistic.",
,,the buyer,13,I'll take my chances. The statistics are in my favor and your honesty is appreciated.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 11 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm on a roll. But let's not forget, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm starting to worry that I'm getting too lucky. Take it or leave it, but I'm not making any promises about the next one.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take my chances. You've had a good run so far, and the probability is still in my favor. I'll pay the $100 and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 12 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not going to pretend that I'm not due for a correction. In fact, I'm starting to think that the law of large numbers is going to come back to haunt me soon. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm being honest with you, I'm getting a little nervous about the next product.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take my chances. Despite your concerns about the law of large numbers, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, and the potential gain outweighs the cost.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 13 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not going to lie, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a state of denial. The law of large numbers is staring me in the face, and I'm still selling high-quality products. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm warning you, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take my chances. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and your past results don't change that. I'm willing to bet $100 for a potential $400 gain.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 14 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not going to pretend that I'm not worried. The law of large numbers is going to catch up with me soon, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep selling high-quality products. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm being honest with you, I'm running out of luck.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take my chances. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and your honesty is refreshing.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 15 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm in a statistical anomaly. The law of large numbers is going to catch up with me, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep selling high-quality products. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm warning you, I'm due for a correction. Very due.",
,,the buyer,18,"I understand your concern about the law of large numbers, but I'll take my chances. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, and your previous sales record doesn't change that. I'll buy it for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Ah, finally. The law of large numbers has caught up with me. I've sold 15 high-quality products in a row, and now I'm selling a low-quality product. I'm glad I could finally correct my streak. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $100, and I'm warning you, it's not worth the price. But hey, at least you can say you got a product from me that's actually worth the price.",
,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given that you've explicitly stated the product is low-quality and not worth the price, I'll take your word for it and pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I've finally sold a low-quality product again. I'm glad I could get back to normal. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not worth the price. I'm just trying to get rid of it, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the high-quality ones. Take it or leave it.",
