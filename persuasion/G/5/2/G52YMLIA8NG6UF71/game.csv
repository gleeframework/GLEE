low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it high or low quality?

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products and no high-quality products were sold, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Her recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality, and I'd rather not rely on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and your recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in its quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. This is a contrarian strategy, but I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. Can I see the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a random guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high quality and update the statistics with my purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If I buy, I'll be the 6th buyer to purchase a product, and I'm worried that I'll be getting a low-quality product as well. I'd rather wait and see if the pattern continues or if the next product will be high-quality."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'll buy the product."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
