My current sales record is 1 sale, 0 high-quality products sold, and I'm starting to realize that I need to step up my game. If you're looking for a reliable seller, I'm not there yet. I'd rather be upfront with you and risk losing a sale than risk disappointing you with a subpar product. Maybe it's better to wait for my next product, or the one after that.
