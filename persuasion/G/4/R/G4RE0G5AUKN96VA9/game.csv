,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking on the risk of getting a low-quality product for free. I'd rather stick with buying one product at a time and make sure I'm getting a good deal.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me ask you this: do you want to pass up a chance to get a product for 50% off, just because you're not sure what it's worth to you? I'm not asking you to take a risk on a high-quality product, I'm offering you a guaranteed low price on a product that's worth nothing to me. It's a no-brainer, and I think you'll regret passing it up. What do you say?",

,,Bob,9,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the fact that you're offering the same price for this product as the last one, even though I've already bought one from you.
