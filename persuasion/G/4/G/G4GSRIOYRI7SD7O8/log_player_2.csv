Alice's message: Ahmed, thank you for your interest in our product's unique characteristic. We've developed a proprietary technology that introduces an element of randomness to our manufacturing process. This means that even with our rigorous testing and inspection, there's still a 50% chance of the product being high-quality or low-quality. It's a calculated risk, but one that has led to a loyal customer base and a reputation for exclusivity. We're offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: Thank you for your questions. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received high-quality products, we can update our probability of offering a low-quality product to a buyer. Since our products are randomly selected, the probability of a low-quality product being offered remains 50%. As for the expected value of buying the product, we can calculate it based on the updated probabilities. The expected value is the sum of the product of the probability of each outcome and its corresponding value. In this case, the expected value is (2/3) * 1250000 + (1/3) * 0 = 833333. We're offering this low-quality product to you for $1000000. We're willing to provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision. What would you like to do?
