"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of getting a high-quality product, the expected value of the purchase is:

* (33.33% chance of high quality) * ($30,000 value) + (66.67% chance of low quality) * ($0 value) = $10,000 

This means the expected value is exactly equal to the price. While Bob is not guaranteed to get a high-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob now knows that you are recommending products based on their quality. Since this round's product is low-quality, recommending it would be dishonest and likely lead to Bob refusing any future offers. 

Even though Bob bought the product in round 1, the expected value of this round is negative ( -$10,000), making it a bad deal."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has learned that you are indeed recommending based on the quality of the product.  Recommending a high-quality product after two consecutive low-quality recommendations would be extremely suspicious to Bob. 

It's more likely that Bob would assume you are trying to trick him. Even though the product is actually high-quality, recommending it at this point would likely lead to distrust and a negative outcome."
