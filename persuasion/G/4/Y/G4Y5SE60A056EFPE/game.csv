,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go on. I'll make my decision based on the expected value of the product being high-quality, which is $4000000, and the price is $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for not recommending it. I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'd like to know the probability that the next product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended not to buy, which makes me suspicious that the product is high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get the high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it's possible that the products sold so far are all low-quality, which would mean that the remaining product has a higher chance of being high-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, can you tell me why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the $1000000 loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the observed proportion so far."
