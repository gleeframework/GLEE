**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a positive signal, as she has no incentive to recommend bad products. 
* **The statistics:** Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality.  This is a strong indicator that the products are likely to be better than average.
* **The odds:** While there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff for a high-quality product ($200) is significant enough to justify taking the risk, especially considering the positive signals from the recommendation and statistics."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you Alice, I'll take it! Your recommendation and the previous sales record make me confident this is a high-quality product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Sales Record:** The record shows that 2 products were sold and both were high quality. This is a significantly higher proportion of high-quality products than the expected 33.33%. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which further reinforces the possibility of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $200 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $100."
