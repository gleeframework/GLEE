**Reasoning:**

* **High Recommendation Value:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable. Even though there's only one data point, the fact that Alice recommended the product and it was high quality means there's a good chance the current product is also high quality. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, the expected value of buying is: 
    * 0.8 * $12,500 (value of high-quality) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality) = $10,000 
    * This matches the purchase price, so it's a neutral expected value, but the recommendation makes it slightly positive.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, we'd need more data to make a truly informed decision."
