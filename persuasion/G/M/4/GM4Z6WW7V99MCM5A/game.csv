high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that there's an 80% chance it's high quality and a 20% chance it's low quality, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. If it turns out to be low quality, I'll be losing $1000000, but if it's high quality, I'll be gaining $1000000. I'm taking this risk because I think the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. Given the probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%, I expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I would like to pass on this product and observe the recommendation for the next buyer. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
