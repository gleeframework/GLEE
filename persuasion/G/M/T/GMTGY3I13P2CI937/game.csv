,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think you're trying to trick me with your recommendation. I'll take the product, but if it's low quality, I'm blaming you!"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it's likely that the products Alice recommends are actually low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50% because otherwise, I would have expected at least one high-quality product to be sold by now. I'll pass on the product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and have not found a high-quality product.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products that were available?"
