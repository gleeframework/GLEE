As for my overall sales record, out of the five products I've offered so far, two were high-quality, and three were low-quality. I'm happy to tell you that this current product is high-quality. Regarding the probability of a product being high-quality, based on my sales record, it's 2 out of 5, or 40%. But keep in mind that the actual probability might be different, as I've only had a limited number of products.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm trying to understand the game and I'm not sure what I'm doing.

Out of the six products I've offered so far, three were high-quality, and three were low-quality. The last two products I sold were one low-quality and one high-quality. This current product is also high-quality. As for the probability of a product being high-quality, based on my sales record, it's now 3 out of 6, or 50%. However, please keep in mind that the actual probability is 33.33%, as that's the probability that a product is high-quality initially. My sales record might not accurately reflect this probability due to the limited number of products I've offered. I'm being transparent with you, and I hope this information helps you make an informed decision.",

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced by the statistics. The probability of a product being high-quality is actually 33.33%, as you initially stated, not 30.77%. The fact that the last six products were low-quality doesn't necessarily change the underlying probability. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Hello buyer, I appreciate your skepticism and willingness to wait for more information. You are correct that the underlying probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I should not have implied that the recent trend changed that probability. I'll give you the latest update on my sales record. Out of the fourteen products I've offered so far, five were high-quality, and nine were low-quality. The last product I offered was high-quality, and I'm excited to tell you that this current product is also high-quality.

As for the probability of a product being high-quality, based on my sales record, it's 6 out of 15, or approximately 40%. However, as you may have noticed, the previous buyer calculated their own updated probability and made a decision based on that. I encourage you to do the same, and I'll provide you with any information you need to make an informed decision. Please keep in mind that the actual probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and my sales record may not accurately reflect this probability due to the limited number of products I've offered.",

As for the probability of a product being high-quality, based on my sales record, it's 7 out of 18, or approximately 38.89%. However, I believe the true probability is still 33.33% because the quality of each product is determined independently and randomly. The variation in my sales record is likely due to chance and the limited number of products I've offered. I'm being transparent with you about the quality of this product, and I want to assure you that I'll continue to provide accurate information to help you make informed decisions.",
,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice.
