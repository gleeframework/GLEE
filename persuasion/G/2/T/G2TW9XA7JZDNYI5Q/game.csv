low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the expected value of buying is still $1000000 (50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $2000000 and 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0)."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a final decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product. I would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering are more likely to be low quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also bought the products despite your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality.
