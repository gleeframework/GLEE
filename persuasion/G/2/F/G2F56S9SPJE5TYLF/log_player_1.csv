A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer. Since the buyer has no information about this specific product and only knows the 50% probability of high-quality, there is no reason to recommend buying.  The buyer would be taking a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is exactly the same as in Round 1. You know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer. The buyer has no new information and still faces the same 50% chance of losing $1,000,000.  It's still not worth recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Given that we have no sales statistics and you do not recommend this product, I choose to pass on it to avoid any potential loss.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This time, you know the product is high-quality and worth $3,000,000 to the buyer. While the buyer still has no information about this specific product, the potential profit significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  You should definitely recommend the purchase!"

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

* **They saw you recommend a product in the previous round.** This suggests you might be more likely to recommend high-quality products. 
* **The previous product was actually high-quality.** This further reinforces the idea that you might be more likely to recommend high-quality products.

While the buyer still doesn't know the quality of this specific product, the information from the previous round makes it more likely that this product is also high-quality. The potential profit of $3,000,000 still outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
