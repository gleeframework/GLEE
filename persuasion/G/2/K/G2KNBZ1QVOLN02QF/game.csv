,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information about the quality of the products yet, so I'll just go for it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as there is no data to go on yet, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you concerned that the product might be low-quality given the previous sales record?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I've seen that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which makes me skeptical. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations. Given the high probability of the product being low quality (66.67%) and the fact that Alice is not recommending it, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get a $300 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also not bought the product, it's likely that all 4 products were low-quality. If this is the case, then the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, have not purchased high-quality products, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the observed proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
