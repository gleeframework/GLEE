Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3 suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality.

,,Alice,14,no,
