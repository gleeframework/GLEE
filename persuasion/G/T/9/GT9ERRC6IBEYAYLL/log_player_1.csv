Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **We have no information about the buyer's valuation of the product.**  We know they want to see sales data, but we don't know if they're looking for a high volume of sales or a high proportion of high-quality sales.
* **We have sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 total.** This is a terrible track record, and even if the buyer is very risk-tolerant, they are unlikely to trust us enough to buy a product at such a high price. 
* **The product is low-quality.**  There is no reason to recommend a low-quality product, especially with our current sales record.

It is more likely we will lose this buyer by recommending the product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll keep an eye on your sales history and consider buying in the future if the quality seems high.

* **Low-quality product:**  There's no incentive to recommend a low-quality product, especially when we have no track record to build trust.

We need to focus on building a positive sales history before we can expect any buyer to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I appreciate you being upfront. Since this is the first product and there's no data yet, I'm going to pass.  I'd like to see how the quality of future products plays out before making a decision.
