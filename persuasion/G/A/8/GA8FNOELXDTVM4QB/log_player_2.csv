Alice's message: I've sold one product already, and I'm glad you're interested in the next one. I want to assure you that my sales record is not skewed by a single product. However, I do want to mention that the product I sold earlier was of high quality, which might make the next product seem like a better value by comparison.

Alice's message: You're right, each product is independent, and the previous sale doesn't affect the current one. However, I want to mention that I've now sold 2 products, and I've only had 1 high-quality one. This might make you wonder if I've sold a high-quality product by chance, or if I've been selling low-quality ones. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent about the fact that I've had a 50% success rate so far.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand your transparency, Alice.

Alice's message: I'm glad I could provide you with a high-quality product earlier, and I'm happy to report that I've now sold 3 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. This means that my success rate is now 66.7%, which is higher than the overall 80% probability of a high-quality product. This might make you wonder if I've somehow managed to'stack the deck' in my favor. I assure you, I'm not, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 80%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. The overall probability of 80% is still in my favor, and one low-quality product doesn't change that. I'm willing to pay $100 for the potential value of $125.""}"

Alice's message: I see you're sticking to the original price. That's fair. However, I want to point out that I've now sold 5 products, with 4 of them being high-quality. This means that my success rate is now 80%, which matches the overall probability. I'm starting to wonder if I've somehow 'normalized' my sales, and the next product is just as likely to be high-quality as the previous ones. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to ask you: do you think I'm due for a low-quality product, or is my streak a sign of something more?

Alice's message: I've sold 8 products, and 7 of them have been high-quality. My success rate is now 87.5%, which is significantly higher than the overall 80% probability.

However, I'm also concerned that if I offer a discount, it might make the product seem less valuable to you.
