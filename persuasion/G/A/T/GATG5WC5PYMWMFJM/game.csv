However, I'm still offering it to you at the same special price of $100. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a steal, and I think it's a great deal. Would you like to take a chance and see what you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a'steal' price. I'd rather pass on it and see if the next product is of higher quality.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns! I'm happy to share with you that I don't have a specific process for selecting products, but I do have a gut feeling about each one. I've been doing this for a while now, and I've developed a sense of what makes a product stand out. With that being said, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $100, and I think it's a great deal, but I'm not going to pretend it's something it's not. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I think you'll be happy with the price, but if not, I completely understand. Would you like to take a chance and see what you think?",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm a bit skeptical about the product being high-quality. With only 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, it seems like the odds are against it being a good deal. I'm not willing to take a chance on it at $100.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your skepticism. I've been working hard to improve my selection process, and I'd be happy to share some changes I've made. I've started working with a new supplier who has a reputation for quality, and I've also implemented a more rigorous testing process to ensure that each product meets my standards. However, I have to be honest with you - this product doesn't meet those standards. It's a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you at a special price of $100.
