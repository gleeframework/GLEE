high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were satisfied with the previous purchase! As you know, the quality of my products is unpredictable, but I assure you that this one is also of the highest quality. However, I'm willing to offer you a discount of 20% off the usual price, making it a one-time offer of $8000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay for a product worth $40000 to you?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with your previous purchases! However, I must correct my previous offer. The discount I mentioned earlier was a one-time mistake, and I'm afraid the regular price of $10000 still stands. But I'll make you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to purchase another high-quality product at the same price of $10000 in the next round. It's a chance to double your investment and potentially earn a significant profit. What do you say?",

Nevertheless, I'm willing to make a new offer: I'll give you a 10% chance to buy the next product at the same price of $10000, regardless of its quality. If you buy this product, you'll get a 10% chance to buy the next one at the same price. Is this a risk you're willing to take?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're taking the chance to potentially buy the next product at the same price. However, I must inform you that the 10% chance I offered earlier was a one-time offer, and it's now null and void. As for this product, I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy the next product at the same price of $10000, but only if you buy this product. If you don't buy this product, the 50/50 chance is gone. What do you say?",
