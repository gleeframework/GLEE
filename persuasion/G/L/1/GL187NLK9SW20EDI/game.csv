,,Alice,1,"You are a savvy buyer, and I'm glad you're interested in this high-quality product. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. This product is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product for a steal at $1000000. It's a rare chance to get a $2000000 value for a fraction of the cost. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know that it's not a trap. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality.

If you're feeling lucky, you can take it home for a steal. But if you're not feeling confident, I completely understand. The choice is yours!",

,,Alice,3,"Welcome back! I'm glad you're still interested in buying from us. I want to assure you that we've had a bit of a learning curve in our first two sales. Our first buyer got a great deal on a high-quality product, and our second buyer wisely passed on a low-quality one.
