,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that there's no prior sales data to inform my decision, but I'm willing to take a chance. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy and the product is low quality 2/3 of the time. I'm hoping to get the high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation given the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or gain more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to infer the probability of a high-quality product based on the statistics. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than expected, but I'll still take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I know that 0 out of 3 previous products were high-quality. I'd like to pass and see the recommendation for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality based on my own experience."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). This might suggest that Alice is being overly cautious in her recommendations, and the product I'm buying might be high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 products have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 5 products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm hoping that I'll get a high-quality product and make a profit."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, hoping that it might be high-quality."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the products she recommends are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
