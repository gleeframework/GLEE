low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality of the product after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 buyer has been recommended to buy and none have bought a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This might be a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I will pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products. I'm hoping to exploit this bias and get a high-quality product at the discounted price."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. If I buy this product, it's likely to be low-quality as well, and I'd be wasting $1000000. I'll pass on this opportunity and see what the next product has to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy it and no high-quality products were sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be a sign that it's a low-quality product, given the low success rate so far."
