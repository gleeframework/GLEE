high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Great, I'm glad you decided to take advantage of the deal. Now, as promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next 3 products. The next product (round 6) is indeed high-quality, just like this one. The product from round 7 is low-quality, and the product from round 8 is also low-quality. I'm glad you got to see a sample of the quality distribution. Now, considering the quality of the products you've seen so far, would you like to buy this high-quality product from round 6 for $100?",

,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your decision. Since you've already bought two high-quality products and passed on the low-quality one, I'd like to offer you a more transparent deal. I'll reveal to you that this low-quality product is actually one of the worst products I have, and it's not even worth $80. I'm willing to give it to you for $0, but that's as low as I can go. This way, you can complete your collection and see the full range of products, even if this one isn't the best.",

If you buy this high-quality product from round 11, I'll give you an additional 10% off the original price, making it $90.
