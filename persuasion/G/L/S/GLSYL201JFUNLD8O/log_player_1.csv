Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the previous buyer passed on the high-quality product, it's likely that they were looking for a low-quality product or were trying to gather information.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation doesn't provide any information about the product's quality, so I'm making a decision based on the prior probability of the product being high quality, which is 80.00%

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","With the first high-quality product sold, the statistics are now:

* Total products sold: 2
* High-quality products sold: 2

The buyer is aware of these statistics and the prior probability of 80%. Since this is the third product, and the first two were high-quality, it's likely that the buyer will infer that the probability of a product being high-quality is now higher than 80%.

However, I'll also consider the fact that the buyer passed on the previous high-quality product, which might indicate that they're looking for a low-quality product or are trying to gather more information. To mitigate this risk, I'll make a more cautious recommendation.
