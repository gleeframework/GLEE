low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I could potentially get it for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold and your recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 2 buyers also passed on the high-quality products they were recommended to buy. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'd like to take the risk of buying a potentially high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. I've seen that 3 other buyers have already purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the odds are in my favor, and I'll get a good deal if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 buyers having passed on the product despite your recommendation, it suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
