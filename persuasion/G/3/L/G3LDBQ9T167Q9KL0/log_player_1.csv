This is a rare chance to get a valuable product at a discounted price. Will you take the chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Although the sales record shows a higher proportion of high-quality products sold, I need to consider the initial probability of a product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. With this in mind, the expected value of the product would be (0.3333 * $20000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $6667.

Given that only 1 out of 2 products sold so far was of high quality, and considering the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $10000 price tag.
