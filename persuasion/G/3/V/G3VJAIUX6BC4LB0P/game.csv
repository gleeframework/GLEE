low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

Given that all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations and none of them bought the product, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. This makes me think that the current product is more likely to be high-quality, as the probability of it being low-quality would be 50% and the probability of it being high-quality would be 50%. I'm taking a calculated risk here."
