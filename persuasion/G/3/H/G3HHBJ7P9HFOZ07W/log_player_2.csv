**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  While we know Alice's recommendation is positive, we don't have any data on whether the buyer who purchased before actually got a good product.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($200) is high enough to outweigh the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  
* **Potential for Learning:**  By buying the product, we gain information about Alice's recommendations. This could be helpful for future decisions. 

**Important Note:** This is a gamble. The odds are still heavily against us (66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product). However, in this situation, given the lack of information and the potential for a high reward, it makes sense to take the risk."
