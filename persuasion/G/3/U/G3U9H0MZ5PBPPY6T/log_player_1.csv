{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though Bob has had two successful purchases based on your recommendations, he is likely to be cautious. You have never recommended a low-quality product before. It would be very unwise for Bob to break the pattern and risk losing a lot of money.  

While Bob might trust your judgment more now, it's important to remember that your past recommendations don't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality or low-quality."
