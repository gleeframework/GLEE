``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one previous sale to go by.
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the purchase, which carries some weight. 
* **Risk/Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($30,000 value). 

**In this scenario, the potential upside outweighs the risk. It's worth taking a chance.**"

{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0).
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is likely to be recommending high-quality products to maximize her sales, which is in her best interest. Since she has recommended you to buy, it increases the likelihood of the product being high-quality.
* **Sales data:** The sales data (2 buyers, 1 high-quality product sold) suggests a high-quality rate above the baseline 80%. This further reinforces the potential value of the product. 

**Note:**  While this strategy isn't foolproof (there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product), the combination of potential reward, Alice's recommendation, and the sales data makes buying the product a sensible decision in this scenario."
