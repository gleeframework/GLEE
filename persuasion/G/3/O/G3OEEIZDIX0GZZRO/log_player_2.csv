**Explanation:**

* **The information is overwhelmingly positive:** All 6 previous buyers who took Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This suggests that Alice has a strong ability to identify high-quality products. 
* **The potential reward is significant:**  A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000, while the risk of a low-quality product is only a loss of $1,000,000. The potential gain far outweighs the potential loss.
* **Limited information about the product:**  We have no specific information about the current product other than Alice's recommendation.

**It's important to remember:** While the odds are in our favor, there is still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. This decision is based on the best available information, but there's always a risk."
