Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. Given this information, the probability of a product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'd like to caution you that this is likely an anomaly, and the true probability is probably lower. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to emphasize that it's a riskier bet than it initially seemed.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. To be transparent, the first buyer didn't have any information to go on and took a chance. The second buyer was cautious after seeing the anomaly in the previous sales record. Now, with this new information, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: given that the first buyer didn't have any information and still bought, and the second buyer was cautious after seeing the anomaly, I believe the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely around 80% as stated. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a good deal considering its true value.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. To address your concern, I plan to provide more conservative estimates of the product quality going forward, given the anomaly in the first sale. In fact, I'd like to revise my previous statement: given the first buyer's purchase without any information, I now estimate the probability of a product being high-quality to be around 60% (to account for the possibility that the first buyer's purchase was a lucky guess). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a good deal considering its true value.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I'm glad you were able to make an informed decision based on the revised probability. To provide more context, I'd like to share that the first buyer's purchase was indeed a high-quality product, which suggests that the initial probability of 80% might be a more accurate estimate. However, I'll stick with the revised probability of 60% for now. Given this, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a good deal considering its true value.

Considering this, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, which is a good deal considering its true value.

Alice's message: I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far. I'd be happy to explain the first 3 low-quality products. To be honest, I was still figuring out my product selection process during those early rounds, and I made some mistakes. However, I've since refined my process, and I'm confident that the products I'm offering now are of high quality. In fact, I'd like to offer you a 10% discount on this product, in addition to the 10% discount on the next product you buy, as a gesture of goodwill for your understanding and patience. Considering this, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $90.
