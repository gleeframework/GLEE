high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the chance, I'm willing to pay $10000 for a potential $40000 value, and I'm the first buyer, so I don't have any prior information to bias my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll pass for now. Can you explain why you're not recommending this product? Is there something I should know about its quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is low, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I don't want to miss out on the potential $40000 gain."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I think the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the 50% chance of it being low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is high enough to justify the purchase price of $10000. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on the low number of sales and the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product based on the previous sales record, which shows only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the probability of the product being high-quality or something else?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is not high enough to justify the $10000 price tag, especially since I have some information about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about your reasoning behind it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products were sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
