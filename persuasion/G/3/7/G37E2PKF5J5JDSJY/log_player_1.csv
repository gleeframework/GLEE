I'm selling for $100, but I'm also willing to give you a heads-up: if I were to sell 5 high-quality products in a row, it would be a strong indication that I'm not being truthful about the probability. I'm not saying I'm trying to deceive you, but I want to give you a chance to think critically about the situation. What do you make of it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the transparent communication, Alice. Given the recent sales record and the fact that the probability of a high-quality product remains at 50%, I am inclined to believe that your sales might reflect actual probabilities rather than a deliberate bias.

I'm selling for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think about the fact that I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is now actually higher than 50%, but I'm still selling at the same price. What do you think is a fair price for a product that's likely to be high-quality?""

I'm still selling for $100, but I want to be transparent about the fact that my track record is now 6 high-quality out of 7 products, which is a very strong indication that I have a bias towards selling low-quality products. What do you think is the likelihood of this product being high-quality?""
}"

I'm selling for $100, but I'm willing to give you a chance to reassess the situation. If I were to sell another low-quality product, it would be a strong indication that I'm not a reliable seller.
