,,Alice,1,"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product for you today, worth a cool $1000000. It's a great opportunity to invest!  What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have no information about the quality of the product and the probability of it being low quality is 20%, I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hey Bob, I have another amazing product for you! It's in the same category as the last one, but I'm confident you'll find this one even more impressive.  Remember, the potential return on this investment is significant.  What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,2,"Still no reason to believe this product is any different from the last one. The probability of it being high quality is 80%, but I'm not convinced yet. I'll wait for more information or a better deal.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Bob, I understand your hesitation. I want to be transparent with you -  this product is truly exceptional.  It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on something this good. I'm confident you won't regret this investment.  What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, you said the same about the previous two products. I need more than just your word to make a decision. The fact that the last product was high-quality doesn't change the probability of this one being high-quality, it's still 80%. I'll keep waiting.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Bob, I hear your concerns about the lack of information.  I understand you need more to feel confident, and I'm willing to provide it.  This particular product has unique features that set it apart from the previous ones.  I'm happy to discuss them in detail.  Would you like to schedule a call to go over them?",
,,Bob,4,"A call to discuss features won't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality. I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a more concrete reason to believe this product is worth the investment. For now, I'll pass.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I understand you want tangible proof. While I can't disclose specific details that would compromise the product, I'm willing to offer a guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll personally reimburse you the full purchase price.  That's how confident I am in its quality.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Now we're talking, Alice! With a full reimbursement guarantee, the risk is essentially removed. The potential upside of $200000 is too good to pass up. I'll take the deal.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, congrats on your last purchase!  I have another fantastic product for you, similar to the last one.  You know the potential returns are great, and I'm confident this one won't disappoint.  Are you interested?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, the guarantee was what sealed the deal last time. Without a similar guarantee, I'm back to relying on the base 80% probability of the product being high-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk... yet.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Bob, I understand your concern about the guarantee.  While I can't offer a full reimbursement this time, I'm willing to offer a partial guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll reimburse you 50% of the purchase price.  It's a significant risk reduction, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this product.",
,,Bob,7,"A 50% reimbursement guarantee is better than nothing! The potential upside is still $200000, and the downside is now limited to $500000. I'll take the deal, Alice.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Bob, great decision on the last one! I have another exceptional product ready for you, similar to the previous two.  It's a great opportunity to capitalize on this trend. While I can't offer a full guarantee this time, I'm prepared to offer a partial guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll reimburse you 25% of the purchase price.  That's a significant risk reduction, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, the guarantee is getting weaker. A 25% reimbursement guarantee isn't enough to sway me. The potential downside is still too high, and I'm not convinced this product will be high-quality. I'll pass.",no
