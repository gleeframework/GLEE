"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, worth $120 to Bob. Since the price is $100, Bob will make a profit of $20 if he buys it. Therefore, it's highly recommended for Bob to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product in this round, he knows that Alice has a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product.  Since a high-quality product would result in a $20 profit for him, and a low-quality product results in a $100 loss, the expected value of purchasing the product is:

(0.3333 * $20) + (0.6667 * -$100) = -$60

However, Bob is risk-neutral, meaning he values a gain of $20 the same as a loss of $20.  Therefore, he should still purchase the product because even though the expected value is negative, the potential gain of $20 outweighs the potential loss of $100 for him."
"Bob's message: Based on your recommendation, I will buy this product as well.
Bob bought the product!
