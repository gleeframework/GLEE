low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm the first one, and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm willing to take the chance to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, which might indicate a biased sample. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product, as the expected value is still higher than 0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's because of your recommendation or my own decision. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it to me?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm assuming the product is low quality. I'll pass on it, and you'll lose money, but I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, and considering the low sales rate of high-quality products (0/4), I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something I'm missing?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, and given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the product is likely to be of low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy, I'm assuming the product is likely to be low-quality. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, given your recommendation, I'll err on the side of caution and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but I know that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find it valuable, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendations have been based on the product's quality, which you know. I'm buying despite your recommendation to see if it's a high-quality product, and to help you learn more about my decision-making process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming that if you don't recommend it, there must be a reason, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 7 buyers were not recommended to buy and none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product for $100, which is a bad deal for me. I'll wait for a more favorable situation or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the low-quality product ratio is high enough to warrant not buying yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, I'm starting to suspect that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
