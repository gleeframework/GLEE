**Explanation:**

* **The Data:**  Only one product has been sold so far, and it was high quality. This means the chance of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true value of the product, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 if it's high quality outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available. It's a calculated risk with a positive potential outcome."
