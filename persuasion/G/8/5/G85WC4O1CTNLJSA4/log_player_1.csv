"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, and the price is fixed at $10,000, it's not recommended to buy. There's no guarantee that the product's value to Bob will exceed the price."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this product for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is high-quality, and you know Bob values high-quality products. Even though you don't know the exact value, it's likely higher than $10,000. Therefore, it's recommended to buy this product."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is low-quality, and Bob has already shown reluctance to buy after a previous low-quality offering. There's no reason to recommend buying a low-quality product at a fixed price when Bob is already hesitant."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a clear pattern of avoiding low-quality products.  Even though you don't know how much Bob values low-quality items, recommending another low-quality product at a fixed price will likely lead to another rejection.  It's better to wait for a high-quality product to recommend."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm starting to see a pattern here, and I'm not comfortable risking a purchase without more information.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is explicitly stating that they are seeing a pattern of low-quality products.  There is no benefit in recommending another low-quality product when Bob is actively hesitant.  At this point, it's better to wait and hope for a high-quality product to recommend.  Trying to push a low-quality product will likely solidify Bob's aversion to buying anything from you."

While he's been hesitant due to a string of low-quality offerings, this is a chance to break that pattern and show him that you can offer valuable products.  He's already expressed a willingness to observe, so recommending this high-quality product might be the push he needs to finally buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hesitant to buy. While I appreciate your recommendation, the recent outcomes haven't given me enough confidence.  I'll wait and see what happens in the next few rounds.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**
