"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a significantly lower price than its potential value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for a high-quality one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, which is $200000 below the market value. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay full price for a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'll wait for a better offer or more information.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate them. I can offer you a 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. If you buy this product, and the next two products are also high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the first product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also get a chance to get the next two products at the full price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. I'd need to pay $900,000 upfront, and even if I get two high-quality products, I'll still be out $900,000 if the first product is low-quality. I'll wait for a better offer or a more straightforward deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. Let's focus on a simpler offer. I'll give you a 'one-time' discount of $100000 off the regular price of $1200000 for this product, making it $1100000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you now. I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal, considering the risk of it being a low-quality product is already taken into account in the price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better offer or take a chance on a lower price.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better offer. Let me propose a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1150000, which is $50000 above the discounted price I offered earlier. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50000 on the second product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a price that's still lower than the market value, and you'll also get a chance to save money on the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the compromise.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand you're still hesitant. Let me offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $50000. It's a very low price, considering it's worth nothing to you. If you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at this price, I'll be happy to move on to the next round and offer you a new product. Your choice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $50,000 for a product that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a new product.""}"

Round 8

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $75000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at an even lower price than before, and you can use it as a bargaining chip or discard it if you don't like the next offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've already taken a loss on the previous product, and I'm not willing to pay $75,000 for a product that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a new product.""}"

However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $25000 on the second product.

Let me make a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1050000, but I'll also give you the option to buy it for $1000000 if you can answer a simple question correctly. If you answer correctly, the price drops to $1000000. If you answer incorrectly, the price remains at $1050000. The question is: What is the probability that the next product I offer is high-quality?

You can keep the gift card, even if you don't want the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather walk away and consider it a loss.""}"

I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product I offer is low-quality. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also have a safety net in case the next product is not what you're looking for.
