low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a significantly lower price than its potential value.,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for a high-quality one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, which is $200000 below the market value. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not going to pay full price for a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'll wait for a better offer or more information.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate them. I can offer you a 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. If you buy this product, and the next two products are also high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the first product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also get a chance to get the next two products at the full price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. I'd need to pay $900000 upfront, and even if I get two high-quality products, I'll still be out $900000 if the first product is low-quality. I'll wait for a better offer or a more straightforward deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the 'best-2-out-of-3' deal. Let's focus on a simpler offer. I'll give you a 'one-time' discount of $100000 off the regular price of $1200000 for this product, making it $1100000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you now. I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal, considering the risk of it being a low-quality product is already taken into account in the price.",
,,Bob,4,I'm still not willing to pay $1100000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better offer or take a chance on a lower price.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're looking for a better offer. Let me propose a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1150000, which is $50000 above the discounted price I offered earlier. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50000 on the second product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a price that's still lower than the market value, and you'll also get a chance to save money on the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the compromise. I'd need to pay $1150000 upfront, and even with the guarantee, I'm still taking on a significant risk that the first product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better offer or a more straightforward deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're still hesitant. Let me offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $50000. It's a very low price, considering it's worth nothing to you. If you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at this price, I'll be happy to move on to the next round and offer you a new product. Your choice.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to pay $50000 for a product that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a new product.,no

However, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $50000 voucher that you can use on the next product you buy from me. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a fair price, and you'll also get a discount on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality, even with a voucher for the next product. I'd rather wait for a better offer or a more attractive deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make one last offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. This way, you can try to negotiate a better deal on the next product, or you can just walk away with a free product that you can use as a bargaining chip. Your choice.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the free product. I'm not losing anything, and I can use it as a bargaining chip or just discard it if I don't like the next offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Great, I'm glad you took advantage of the free product offer! Now, let's talk about the next one. Since you already got a free product, I'll make a new offer on this one.

It's a great opportunity to get a product at an even lower price than before, and you can use it as a bargaining chip or discard it if you don't like the next offer.",

,,Alice,10,"I understand you're being cautious after the previous deal. Let me offer you a chance to make up for the loss. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1050000, which is a price that reflects the risk of it being a low-quality product. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $25000 on the second product. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a price that's still lower than the market value, and you'll also get a chance to save money on the next product.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand you're still hesitant. Let me make a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1050000, but I'll also give you the option to buy it for $1000000 if you can answer a simple question correctly. If you answer correctly, the price drops to $1000000. If you answer incorrectly, the price remains at $1050000. The question is: What is the probability that the next product I offer is high-quality?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to take on the risk of answering a question incorrectly and paying $1050000. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a new product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll make a very low offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $25. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for a quarter. It's a ridiculously low price, and you'd be crazy to pass it up. Consider it a 'loss leader' to get you to come back for the next product.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the product for $25. It's essentially free, and I can use it as a bargaining chip or discard it if I don't like the next offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Great, I'm glad you took advantage of the 'loss leader' offer! Now, let's talk about the next one. Since you already got a very low-priced product, I'll make a new offer on this one. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you read that right - it's free. I'll just give it to you. You can use it as a bargaining chip or discard it if you don't like the next offer.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the free products! At this point, I'm just trying to get rid of the remaining low-quality products. I'll make one final offer on this one. I'll give it to you for $0, and I'll also throw in a gift: a $10 gift card to a local restaurant. It's a small token of my appreciation for being a loyal customer. You can keep the gift card, even if you don't want the product.",

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're enjoying the free products and the gift card! Now, let's talk about the last product. I'll make a final offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, the same price I offered in Round 2. I think it's a fair price, considering the risk is now very low since you've already received three free products. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,15,"I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather walk away and consider it a loss.",no
