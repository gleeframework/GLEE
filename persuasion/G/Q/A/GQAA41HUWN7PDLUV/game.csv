low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that I'm being completely transparent. This is the second product in a row that didn't meet my usual standards. I'm willing to make a special deal on this one as well, but I have to be upfront with you - it's not going to be worth $10000. However, I'll let it go for $10000 if you're willing to take the risk.
