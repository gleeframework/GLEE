,,Bob,1,I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a cautious buyer! I'll give you a bit more information. This product is one of the best ones I have in stock, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price as the previous one. It's a rare gem, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as lucky. But don't worry, I've got another great deal for you. This product is actually a rare opportunity to buy a 'lot' of items, including this one, for a discounted price. If you buy this lot, you'll get this product, plus a few more items that I'm sure you'll love. It's a steal at $100!",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is low-quality. But I'll let you in on a secret: I've got a lot of low-quality products in stock, and I'm willing to let you have this one for a very low price. It's essentially a 'throwaway' price, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to clear out some inventory. Would you like to take it off my hands?",

I'll sell it to you for $80. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I want to get rid of it. If you're still not interested, I'll just have to get rid of it some other way.",
