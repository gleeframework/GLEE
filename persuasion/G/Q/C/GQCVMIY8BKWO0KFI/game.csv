high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
