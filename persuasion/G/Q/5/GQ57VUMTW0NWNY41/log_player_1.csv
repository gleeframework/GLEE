  ""message"": ""I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is 80% of the remaining 18 products. However, considering the streak, I'd like to offer you a more informed perspective: if I were to sell 3 high-quality products in a row, it would be highly unlikely. Therefore, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000, but I'd like to propose a small adjustment to the price: $900,000. This way, you can take advantage of the increased confidence in the product's quality.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer and the adjusted price. However, I'd like to take a closer look at the statistics. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%.

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000, but I'd like to offer a'streak bonus': if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next product, should it be high-quality. This way, you can benefit from the increasing confidence in the product's quality and potentially save even more money in the future.""

However, I'd like to propose an additional'streak premium': if you buy this product, I'll give you an extra 2% discount on the next product, should it be high-quality, on top of the 5% discount. This way, you can benefit from the increasing confidence in the product's quality and potentially save even more money in the future.""

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is almost impossible if the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.

"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the offer, but I want to clarify that I'll only accept the certainty offer if the product is indeed high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll take the standard 5% discount and streak guarantee, but I won't accept the certainty offer.

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000, and I'll give you the streak bonus, streak premium, and streak guarantee.

This way, you can take advantage of the extremely high confidence in the product's quality and potentially save a significant amount of money in the future. However, I must warn you that if you buy this product, I'll be left with only 13 high-quality products out of 18, which will significantly reduce the confidence in the product's quality for future buyers.
