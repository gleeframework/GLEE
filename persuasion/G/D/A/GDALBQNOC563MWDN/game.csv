low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with your second purchase! However, I want to be transparent with you - this next product is a bit of an exception. I've had some quality control issues with this particular batch, and I'm not as confident in its value as I am with my usual high-quality items. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it may not meet the same standards as my usual products.
