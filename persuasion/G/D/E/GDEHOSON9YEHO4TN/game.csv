low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 5 buyers also got a recommendation to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics, as 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that I can get for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to its true value of $0 to me."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
