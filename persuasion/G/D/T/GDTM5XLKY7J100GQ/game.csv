I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or not, and based on the statistics, it seems like none of the previous products were high quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing the outcome of my purchase, and I'd like to contribute to the statistics."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, which would be a good value for me given the $100 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given your past recommendations. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my assessment. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm worried that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products given the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if the product is high-quality, it would have been sold by now, given the previous 5 buyers and the fact that Alice recommended it. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what makes you think this product is not worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have rejected the product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
