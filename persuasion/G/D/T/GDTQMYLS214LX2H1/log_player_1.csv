Round 17
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice should recommend the product, despite Bob's recent streak of not buying.  Here's why:

1. **Bob's Pattern:**  While Bob has passed on eight products in a row, this is likely because he's trying to identify the high-quality products. 
2. **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality, and it's possible Bob will buy it to break his pattern of rejecting.  Even if he doesn't, there's no downside to recommending it.
3. **No Loss:**  Alice has no way of knowing how much Bob values the products, so recommending the high-quality product gives her a chance to make a sale without any risk.

While Bob might not buy this time, Alice should keep recommending high-quality products and see if Bob's strategy shifts."
"Bob's message: Alice is recommending it, maybe this one will be the exception.
Bob bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}

Bob just bought a product, but he's been passing for a long time.  It's unlikely he'll buy another one so soon, especially since it's likely low-quality. There's no benefit to recommending a product he's likely to reject."
"Bob's message: After the last one, I'm being cautious again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob passed on the last product and has a pattern of passing on low-quality products. Recommending this low-quality product will likely result in another rejection and no sale for Alice."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

While Bob hasn't bought a product for a while, there's a chance he'll buy this one. He has a pattern of buying when the product is high quality, and he's been passing on low-quality products. It's a risk, but Alice has nothing to lose by recommending the product.  If Bob buys, she makes a sale, and if he doesn't, she's no worse off than she was before."
