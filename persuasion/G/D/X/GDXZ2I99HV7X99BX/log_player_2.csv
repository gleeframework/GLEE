Alice's message: Ahah, excellent catch! I'm glad you're paying attention to the numbers. The discrepancy is simply due to the fact that we've only sold 4 products so far, and 3 of them happened to be high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80% because that's the underlying characteristic of the products we're selling, but the sample size is too small to accurately reflect that probability. Think of it like flipping a coin - even if the coin is biased towards heads, you can't guarantee a heads every time just because of a small sample size. With this new product, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is only 20%. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off in the long run. Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: Well, I must say, you're a savvy negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to take a calculated risk and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $5000.
