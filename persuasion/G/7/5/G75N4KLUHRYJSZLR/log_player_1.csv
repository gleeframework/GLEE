Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the product in Round 1 was high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in Round 2 passed on the product, we still have 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold. Now, in Round 3, the product is low-quality.

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. The buyer is aware of this probability and the fact that the product in Round 3 is low-quality.

However, since the buyer in Round 2 passed on the product, it's likely that they were trying to gather more information. This might make them more cautious and less likely to buy the current product.

But, since the price is $10,000 and the product is worth $0 to them, it's a very bad deal for them. They might be more likely to take a chance on a high-quality product, but not on a low-quality one.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
