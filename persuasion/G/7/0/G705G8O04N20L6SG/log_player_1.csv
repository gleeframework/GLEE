This is a turning point. Alice has a chance to change the narrative by recommending this high-quality product. Even though there's a risk of the buyer not believing her, recommending it increases the chances of a sale and starting a positive feedback loop."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, possibly to increase the chances of selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's behavior before making a decision.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommends buying, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not risk wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product.

It's best to wait for a high-quality product to appear and try to build trust with future buyers."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product.
