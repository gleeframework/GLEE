The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid this product is not as high-quality as the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a special discount of 50% off the usual price if you're willing to take it as-is. Would you like to take it for $5000?

I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy this high-quality product at a price that's significantly lower than the market value. I'll sell it to you for $5000. If you're interested, it's a steal.

I'll make a bold offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $3000, but only if you agree to buy it sight unseen. No returns, no exchanges. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a free accessory worth $1000. What do you say?

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $2000, and I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a reasonable person. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product.

Round 10
Alice's message: I've made it clear that this product is high-quality and worth more than $2000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.
