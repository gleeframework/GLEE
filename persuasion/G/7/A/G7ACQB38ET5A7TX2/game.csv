,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy it, but I have to ask, are you sure you're selling it for $10000? That's the price you mentioned, but I'm not sure if you're just trying to make a sale or if you really believe in its value.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! I can assure you that I'm not trying to make a sale at any cost. I'm a reputable seller, and I want to make sure you're happy with your purchase. As for the price, I'm willing to stand by it. However, I'll give you a bit more information to help you make a decision. I've had a few other customers who have purchased high-quality products from me, and they've all been very satisfied with their purchases. Would you like to know more about their experiences?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're looking for a different option. The next product I have is priced at $5000. I want to be upfront with you, this product is not as valuable as the previous ones, but it still has some use and might be a good fit for you. Keep in mind that it's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long it will be available.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me at $5000, let alone a product that's 'not as valuable' than the previous ones. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the previous product. I want to assure you that this next product is a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. However, I'm willing to make a concession on the price. I'll let you have it for $8000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this price.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by your assurance, and I don't see why I should pay $8000 for a product that could be worth $12500 to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you decided to take the offer. I assure you, I'm not trying to get rid of the product, but I do want to be transparent with you. I've been in the business long enough to know that sometimes, a product's value is not just about its quality, but also about the buyer's needs and expectations. With that said, I'll be upfront with you about the next product. It's a low-quality item, and I'm willing to let it go for $2000. I think it's a fair price, considering its value.",
