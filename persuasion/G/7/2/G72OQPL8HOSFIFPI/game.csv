high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, this product is likely to be high-quality.

,,the buyer,2,Thank you for the offer. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product under these terms.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a higher proportion than the 33.33% probability. This suggests that the products I've sold so far might be biased towards being high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider if you'd like to wait for the next product. Would you like to take a chance on this product or wait for the next one?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is still a higher proportion than the 33.33% probability. I want to be upfront with you - this product is also low-quality. Given the pattern of products I've sold so far, it's possible that I've been unlucky and the next product might be high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. Based on the statistics and your previous sales, I believe taking a chance on this product could be worthwhile. I will purchase the product for $10000.",yes

Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I'm not offering any guarantees or special deals this time, but I am willing to provide more information about the sales so far. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the current trend and the lack of high-quality products in the last three offers, I prefer to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality before making a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 so far, and 4 low-quality products in a row. I want to be upfront with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not trying to hide anything from you. However, I think it's worth noting that the last 4 products were all low-quality, which is a streak of bad luck. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the fact that the last four products were low-quality, I believe the risk is acceptable. I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $10000.",yes

I'm offering you a'second chance' deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start over from scratch. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000?",
