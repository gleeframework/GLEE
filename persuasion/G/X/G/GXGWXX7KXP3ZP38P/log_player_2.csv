**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is a significantly better chance than a coin flip.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. While this doesn't guarantee it's high quality, it's a strong signal in your favor.
* **Limited information:** There's only one previous sale, so we don't have much data to work with.  However, it's positive that the one product sold was high quality. 

**It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product at a good price outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.**"
