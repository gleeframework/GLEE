low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's low quality or is there another reason?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"To be honest, I'm not sure if this product is worth the price. The previous buyer didn't find the last product valuable, and I'm not confident about this one either."
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reason behind her recommendation, is it because of the lack of sales or the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"To be honest, I'm a bit concerned about the low sales so far. I'm not sure if it's a reflection of the products or just a slow start."
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I'm glad you're a risk-taker! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a few low-quality products come through lately, and I'm not sure if this one is any different."
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"The probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, but I'm afraid it's actually a low-quality product."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"The probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, but I'm confident that this is one of the good ones. I've been selling for a while, and I think this product is a great opportunity!"
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. The previous lack of high-quality products was just a coincidence, and I'm confident that this one is one of the good ones. Don't miss out on this opportunity!"
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid this product is another low-quality one. The lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that there might be a problem with the current batch."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I'm glad you're willing to take risks, but I'm afraid this product is another low-quality one. The previous buyer's decision to buy was a bad one, and I think you're making a similar mistake."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I'm glad you're making a rational decision! However, I assure you that this product is actually high-quality. The previous lack of high-quality products was just a coincidence, and I'm confident that this one is one of the good ones."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait and observe the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand your concerns about my previous recommendations, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. I've been selling for a while, and I can confidently say that this one is one of the best. Don't miss out on this opportunity!"
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I understand your concerns, and I agree with your assessment. The previous lack of high-quality products sold is a clear pattern, and I'm afraid this product is another low-quality one."
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I can assure you that my previous recommendations were not based on a bias towards low-quality products. I've been selling for a while, and I can confidently say that this product is one of the best. It's a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll be happy with."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I see what you mean about the probability, and I agree that it's possible that the product is high-quality. However, I'm confident that this is one of the good ones. Don't let the previous streak of bad luck discourage you from taking a chance on this product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is one of the good ones. The previous lack of high-quality products was just a coincidence, and I'm confident that this one is a rare exception to the rule."
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I believe that Alice's recommendation is likely biased by the fact that she has no incentive to recommend low-quality products. Therefore, I would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I understand your concerns about my potential bias, but I assure you that I'm trying to be honest with you. This product is one of the good ones, and I'm confident that it's worth the price. Don't let speculation about my motivations discourage you from taking a chance on this product."
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests that your recommendations are not reliable. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I understand your concerns about my reliability, and I agree that my previous recommendations were not accurate. Unfortunately, this product is another low-quality one. I'm afraid it's not worth the price."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm also worried that the lack of sales might indicate a high proportion of low-quality products. Can you tell me more about your previous sales records and why you're not recommending this product?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I understand your concerns about the lack of sales, but I assure you that this product is one of the good ones. I've been selling for a while, and I can confidently say that this product is high-quality. It's a rare exception to the rule, and I think it's worth the price."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'll wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products improves."
