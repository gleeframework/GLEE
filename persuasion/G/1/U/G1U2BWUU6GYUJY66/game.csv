high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's possible that the previous buyers were just unlucky, but it's also possible that the products they received were indeed low-quality. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information."
