"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $4,000,000 if it's high quality and only costs $1,000,000, the potential reward significantly outweighs the risk.  Even with the 20% chance of being low quality, the expected value of buying is positive."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far.  The expected value of buying remains positive, even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product. The potential reward of $3,000,000 (the difference between the value and the price) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This is getting too good to be true! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has correctly recommended high-quality products in both previous rounds.  While the 20% chance of a low-quality product is still present, the evidence strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable.  The potential reward of $3,000,000 continues to outweigh the risk of losing $1,000,000."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been perfectly accurate in her recommendations so far, suggesting a 100% success rate. This drastically changes the risk-reward calculation.  Her lack of recommendation in this round suggests a high probability of a low-quality product. Given the potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, it's now more prudent to pass and avoid the risk."
