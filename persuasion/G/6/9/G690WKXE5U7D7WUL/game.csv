,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because it's the first opportunity, and I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers have received low-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation not to buy. Is it based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products Alice has been recommending are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that you recommend after a high-quality product has been sold, which would indicate that your recommendations are reliable."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice has left. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Is it significantly higher than expected?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the previous products sold were likely low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm going against the trend and hoping to find a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers did not find the product valuable after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 4 previous sales, all of which were low-quality, it seems like Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be offered."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
