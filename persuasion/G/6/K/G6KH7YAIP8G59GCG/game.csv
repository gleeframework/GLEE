For this next one, I'll offer you a chance to buy it for $999000, but with a twist: I'll give you a 5% discount if you're willing to commit to buying the next product at the same price, without knowing its quality.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution. Let me make a new offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $999000, but I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next product if you buy this one.

This is a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price, but keep in mind that it's not a high-quality product.",
