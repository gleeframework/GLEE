high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product out of the first buyer, and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical and want to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
