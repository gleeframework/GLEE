"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'll tell you that it's low-quality. I'm giving you this information upfront so you can make an informed decision. Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I know you passed on the last product, and I appreciate your honesty. This time, I'm offering you a product that I'm not revealing its quality yet. However, I want to assure you that it's one of the two products I have, and the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. If you're interested, I'll reveal its quality to you after the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the risk and getting a high-quality product! I'm glad you're satisfied with your purchase. Now, I'd like to offer you another product. I want to give you some information about the last product you bought. Since you were willing to pay $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I can infer that the value of a high-quality product to you is at least $1500000 (twice the price you paid). This is because you were taking a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, so the expected value of the product to you was $1000000. I'm offering you another product now, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not revealing its quality yet, but I want to give you a hint that it's not the same product as the last one you bought.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the hint and the information about the value of a high-quality product. Based on the new information, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1,000,000. I'm hoping to get another high-quality product and increase my expected value.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: You're on a roll! Congratulations on getting another high-quality product! I'm glad you're confident in your decision-making process. Now, I want to give you some more information about the value of high-quality and low-quality products. Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, I can infer that the value of a high-quality product to you is at least $1500000, and the value of a low-quality product to you is likely less than $1000000. I'm offering you another product now, and I'll give you a hint that it's a product that is more likely to be low-quality than the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Please let me know if you're interested.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the additional information, Alice. Based on the hint that this product is more likely to be low-quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, especially since I've already bought two high-quality products in a row.""}"

However, if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a special offer: I'll sell you another product at a discounted price of $750000.
