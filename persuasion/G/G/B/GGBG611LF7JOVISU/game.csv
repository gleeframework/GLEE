,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was also recommended to buy and chose to pass, it suggests that the product may be of low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record might be due to the low quality of the products, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not expecting it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you've seen a pattern of low-quality products being sold in the past?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I think there might be a higher chance of it being low-quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product and that 4 previous buyers have also purchased the products, I'm going to pass on this product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, and I'm better off waiting for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping the low-quality product rate is higher than expected, and I might get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products recommended by you have been low-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are not reliable. I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given the previous 6 buyers all passed on the product and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to assume the product is low-quality and take the risk. I'll buy it for $1000000, but if it's high-quality, I'll be very disappointed."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 7 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given Alice's recommendation against the product, I'm inclined to believe it's likely low-quality as well. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 9th buyer and no high-quality product has been sold yet, so I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
