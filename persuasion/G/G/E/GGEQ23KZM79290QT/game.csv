low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 2 products so far, and neither of them were high-quality. You're now at a 0% chance of getting a high-quality product from me. It's a 100% chance that this one is also low-quality. But hey, you can still try your luck...",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 3 products in total, with 1 of them being high-quality. That's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product from me. I'm not going to lie, I've had a bit of a rough start, but I'm confident that this one is the good stuff. Want to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I sold 2 low-quality products in the first 2 rounds. Then, I sold a high-quality product in the 3rd round. Since then, I've sold another low-quality product. So, out of 4 products, 2 are low-quality and 1 is high-quality. That's a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product from me. I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think this one might be the last chance to get a good deal...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 6 products in total, with 3 of them being low-quality and 2 of them being high-quality. I've had a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but I'm not giving up! I'll be honest with you, the last 2 products I sold were both low-quality, so you might want to think twice before taking a chance on this one...",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it, considering the recent trend of low-quality products. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $1000000, but if it's low-quality, I'll walk away and you can discard it.",yes

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 13 products in total, with 8 of them being low-quality and 5 of them being high-quality. I've noticed that the low-quality products seem to be concentrated in the earlier rounds, and the high-quality ones seem to be more spread out. I'm not sure if that's a coincidence or a pattern, but I think it's worth considering. This one's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll give you a special deal: I'll throw in a free inspection report, so you can verify the product's quality for yourself. Take a chance and see what you get!",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate the free inspection report, but I'm still cautious. Given the pattern you've observed, I'd like to ask: If you had a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product to each buyer, wouldn't we expect to see a more even distribution of high and low-quality products across all sales? The fact that low-quality products seem to be concentrated in the earlier rounds suggests to me that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'd like to take the free inspection report and verify the product's quality for myself, but I'd also like to ask you to reveal the true probability of a high-quality product being sold to each buyer. Transparency would go a long way in building trust.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 14 products in total, with 9 of them being low-quality and 5 of them being high-quality. I must admit, I was impressed by your analytical skills. You're right, if I had a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product to each buyer, we would expect to see a more even distribution. I'll be honest with you, the true probability of a high-quality product being sold to each buyer is actually around 30%. I'm not sure why it's been lower than expected, but I'm working on it. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm not trying to hide it. I'll give you a straight-up deal: I'll sell it to you for $500000, and you can walk away if you're not satisfied. No strings attached.",
,,the buyer,14,"Thank you for the honesty, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. However, with a 30% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that the expected value of this product is worth the $500000 price. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not willing to take a chance on this low-quality product, especially at a price that's half of what you originally offered. I'd like to wait and see if you have any high-quality products left. Can you tell me more about the 19 products you've sold so far? What was the quality of the last 4 high-quality products you sold?",no

,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is around 20% (5 high-quality products out of 20 total products sold).
