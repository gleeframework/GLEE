However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not only of questionable quality, but it's also one that I've had some difficulty selling to other customers. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm also willing to throw in a 'get out of one bad deal' free pass. If you buy this product and it turns out to be a lemon, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. That's a $100 product for $100, with a potential $100 return if things don't work out.""

If you buy it, I'll also throw in a second product of your choice from my next 5 offerings. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. It's a risk-free opportunity to try out two products, and if you don't like either one, you can return them both and I'll give you a full refund.""
