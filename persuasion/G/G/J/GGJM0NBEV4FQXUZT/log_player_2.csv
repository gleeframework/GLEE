"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you because I believe in our potential partnership. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for a one-time offer that's still 75% of the product's value. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.""}"

Alice's message: I understand your caution, Bob. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll offer you a second product of equal or higher value at the same price of $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to double your investment with potentially two high-quality products. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee.

Round 3

Product 1 was indeed high-quality, and I'm happy to share that Product 2 is also high-quality. Now, I'm offering you Product 3 for $1000000. With two high-quality products already confirmed, the probability of Product 3 being high-quality is now 66.67%. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""With two high-quality products already confirmed, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the third product.

Round 4
Alice's message: Congratulations on making a wise decision, Bob! You've secured two high-quality products so far. Now, regarding the new product, I want to be upfront with you. Given the alternating pattern of high-quality and low-quality products we've seen so far, I'm concerned that this next product might be low-quality as well. However, I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you choose to inspect, I'll let you examine the product for 5 minutes, and you can decide then whether to buy it or not. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I've already bought two high-quality products, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll pass and see what the next product is.""}"

If you buy now, you'll have the option to buy the next product at this price, and you can decide then whether to keep it or not. If you don't buy now, the price of the next product will be revealed, and you'll have to pay the market price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in locking in the next product at $1,000,000.
