,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Given the pattern of Alice not recommending low-quality products accurately so far, and the overall probability favoring low quality, I'll continue to avoid the risk and not buy this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendations have been accurate for low-quality products so far, and the probability still leans towards low quality. I'll keep trusting her judgment on the products she advises against and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"The pattern continues, and Alice's non-recommendations have consistently aligned with low-quality products. Given the odds and her track record, I see no reason to change my strategy and will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"At this point, it's clear that Alice's non-recommendations are a strong indicator of the product being low quality. I'll stick with the strategy that has avoided losses so far and not buy this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"The consistency of Alice's non-recommendations aligning with low-quality products suggests she's truthful about the products she advises against. Given this and the overall probability, I'll continue to pass on products she doesn't recommend."
