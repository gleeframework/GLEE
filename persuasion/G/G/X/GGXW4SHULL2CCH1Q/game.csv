low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy it, I don't know its quality and you don't know its value to me, so I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the chance. You're recommending it, so it must be good, right? I'll buy it for $10000, hoping it's worth at least that much to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm on a roll! I'll buy it again, hoping for another high-quality product that will bring me a nice profit."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,Two for two! I'm on a hot streak. I'll take the chance again and hope for a third high-quality product.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Wait a minute... I've bought three high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think Alice might be bluffing or trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one and see if she's trying to pull the wool over my eyes."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not as reliable as I thought. Since she didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation at face value this time. I've been burned twice by her lack of recommendation, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Déjà vu! Alice is recommending against it, just like in rounds 5 and 6. I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on Alice's recommendation again. I've been burned twice by her lack of recommendation, but I've also been rewarded three times when she recommended a product. I'll take the risk and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've been burned by Alice's lack of recommendation twice now, and I've learned to trust my instincts. When she doesn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm sticking to my strategy. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm passing. It's too big of a risk to spend $10000 on a product that might be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,Consistency is key! I'm sticking to my strategy of passing on products that Alice doesn't recommend. It's too big of a risk to take on a potentially worthless product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Same decision, same reasoning. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm out. It's not worth the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll keep passing on them and hope that she recommends a high-quality one eventually.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm taking a chance on Alice's recommendation. She's recommended a product before and it turned out to be high-quality, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've been burned by Alice's lack of recommendation before, and I'm not going to take the risk again. I'll pass on this one and wait for her to recommend a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm sticking to my strategy. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm out. It's just not worth the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is a pretty reliable indicator of a low-quality product. I'll keep passing on these ones.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not changing my strategy now. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass on this one and see what happens in the final round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"The final round! I'm sticking to my strategy one last time. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm out. I'll end the game with a 4/16 success rate, which isn't bad, but I could have done better if I had trusted my instincts more and taken more risks when she recommended a product."
