Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this one is any better than the previous one, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it for $1,000,000 without knowing its quality.""}"

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had this product on my shelf for a while, and I'm starting to think it might be a bit of a loss for me if I don't sell it soon.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that you're describing as a standard model and a potential loss for you.

However, I want to emphasize that it's still a decent product, and you might be able to resell it for a small profit.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth even $900,000 to me, let alone $900,000. I'd like to wait and see if you have any higher-quality products available.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of a guarantee, but it doesn't change my decision. I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, even with a guarantee. The potential loss is still too great.""}"

That's the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but even at $250,000, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.""}"
