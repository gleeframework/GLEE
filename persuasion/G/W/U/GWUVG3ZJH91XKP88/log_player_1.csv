}"

Think of it as a chance to get a 'free' product, and you can always sell it or use it as a learning experience.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your creative spin, but I'm not buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me for $100. That doesn't make financial sense, and I'll have to pass on this one.

}"
"Bob's message: With the guarantee, I feel more confident in the purchase. If it's indeed a high-quality product, I'll get the value I'm expecting, and if not, I can get a full refund. That mitigates the risk, so I'll take the deal.
