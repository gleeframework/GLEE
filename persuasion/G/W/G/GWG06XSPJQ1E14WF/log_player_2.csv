"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since we have no information about the quality of the product yet, and Alice's recommendation is the only information we have, it's worth taking a gamble and buying the product.  We have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which would result in a $100 profit."

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee the quality, we now have some evidence to suggest she might have some insight.
