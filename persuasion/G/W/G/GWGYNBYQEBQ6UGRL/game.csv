low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. In the previous round, the buyer chose not to purchase the product, but I'll let you in on a little secret: that product was low-quality. This is a new product, and I assure you it's a great opportunity. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing this because I have no prior information to go on. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I've sold one product so far, and I can disclose that it was low-quality. However, I assure you that the product I'm offering now is of exceptional value. Don't miss this opportunity! Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I've sold one product so far, and I disclosed that it was low-quality. In the previous round, the buyer chose not to purchase the product, but I can tell you that the product was actually high-quality. Don't let that sway you, though - this new product is a fresh opportunity. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm going to need some reassurance that it's not low-quality. Can you tell me what the probability of a high-quality product is, given that one low-quality product has been sold and one high-quality product was passed on?",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, but let me give you a more informed view. Out of the three previous products, one was low-quality and sold, one was high-quality but not sold, and another was low-quality and sold. So, out of the three products that have been revealed, two were low-quality. However, I assure you that the product I'm offering now is a great opportunity. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your sales record. Two low-quality products out of three is a bad sign, and I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd like to know more about the high-quality product that wasn't sold. Was it offered to a buyer before me, and if so, why didn't they buy it?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I understand that my previous sales record may not be convincing, but I'd like to provide some context. The high-quality product that wasn't sold was offered to a buyer in Round 3. They chose not to buy it because they were aware of the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product and wanted to wait for more information. As for this new product, I assure you it's a fresh opportunity. However, I must disclose that out of the four previous products that were revealed, three were low-quality. Would you like to buy it for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to know the total number of products offered before, and the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Also, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the information you provided.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. To answer your questions: a total of 6 products have been offered before, and out of the 5 products that were revealed, 4 were low-quality. The proportion of low-quality products sold is 3 out of 4 sold products. As for the probability of the product being high-quality, I'll let you do the math. However, I can tell you that the product I'm offering now is a new opportunity. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product being offered hasn't changed, it's still 33.33%.
