low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product as well. I'm not sure if this is a case of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer who doesn't value it highly, or if it's just a low-quality product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd rather not take the risk."

If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be out $100. If I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on $300. Given the current statistics, I think it's better to pass on the product and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
