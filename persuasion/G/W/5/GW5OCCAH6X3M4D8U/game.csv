,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended it. Since 1 out of 1 buyers has purchased a product and it was of low quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products.

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I know you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, it seems like your recommendations have been accurate so far. If I'm not mistaken, this means that all 2 sold products were low-quality, right? If so, I'd like to know your reasoning for this particular product being different."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product and observe more data."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
