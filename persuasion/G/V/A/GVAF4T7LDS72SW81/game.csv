,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% due to the fact that you haven't recommended it to the previous 5 buyers. If it were high-quality, I would have expected at least one of them to have bought it, given the 50% chance of it being high-quality. Therefore, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
