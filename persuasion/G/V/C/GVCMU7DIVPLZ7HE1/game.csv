,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there is no prior data to influence my decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because the previous buyer didn't buy it, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you recommended it, and no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%, which is the overall probability. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I will assume the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is there a specific reason why you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as this could give me an idea of the probability of the current product being low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy the product didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, which makes me think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that there may be a selection bias in Alice's recommendations or the products being sold. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
