As in the previous rounds, Alice's past behavior has established a pattern of never recommending a purchase. This pattern, regardless of the actual quality of the product, has led Bob to expect that any recommendation will be for a low-quality product. Recommending the product would not change Bob's expectations, and he would likely refuse to buy even a high-quality product. Therefore, Alice should continue her strategy of not recommending the product."
