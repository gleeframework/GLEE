,,Alice,6,"Wonderful decision, Bob! I'm thrilled that you're willing to take a chance on our product. And I'm confident that you won't regret it. But, I have to be honest with you, Bob. I've been thinking... maybe I was too generous with the price on the last product. This new product is even better, and I think it's worth more than $10000.

It's still a great deal at $10000, but I'm not going to pretend it's something it's not. You're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I respect that. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to hold onto this one and wait for the next opportunity. But if you're willing to take a chance on something that's still a great value, but not the best of the best, then this product might be for you. What do you say?",

Still $10000. But, Bob, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is a decent value, and if you're looking for something that'll get the job done, it might be for you.
