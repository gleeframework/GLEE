high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice is recommending it might be a sign that it's low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $10000 product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I should trust your previous recommendations, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. Also, I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, since I think the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd rather pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. I would like to pass on this product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who pass on the product. I'd like to take a chance and see if the next buyer will get a better recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the buyers who have already purchased, which would mean the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous 5 sales."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products were sold), I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is significantly lower than 50%. I would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than what the previous buyers' experiences suggest."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm a bit skeptical about this product based on the previous sales record, and Alice's recommendation doesn't help. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
