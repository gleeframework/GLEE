high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and the cost is $10000, and since I only have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I don't want to take the risk this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend the product and she knows its quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I will trust her recommendation this time and avoid the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Similar to the previous round, since Alice does not recommend the product and she knows its quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I will trust her recommendation again and avoid the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,Alice has consistently not recommended low-quality products so far. I will continue to trust her recommendation and avoid buying a product that is likely to be of low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's pattern of not recommending low-quality products continues. I see no reason to doubt her recommendation at this point, so I will pass on buying the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice has consistently not recommended low-quality products and has only not recommended products that were indeed low-quality. Now that she recommends a product, I trust that it is likely to be high-quality, so I will take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Given that Alice's previous recommendation was correct and I gained $2000 from the transaction, I will continue to trust her recommendations. It's likely that this product is also high-quality, so I will buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend the product and her non-recommendations have been accurate so far, it's likely that this product is low-quality.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Although I was cautious in the previous round and Alice's recommendation was correct, I missed out on a $12000 opportunity.
