* **Risk of Reputational Damage:** If the buyer discovers the product is low-quality after purchasing it, they will likely spread negative feedback, harming your business.

Therefore, it's best to be transparent with the buyer and decline to recommend the product. Even though you will miss out on a sale, you will preserve your integrity and protect your long-term success."
