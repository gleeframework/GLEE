"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product other than Alice's recommendation, and the product is worth $40,000 if it's high quality,  it's a good gamble to buy it. Even if it turns out to be low quality, you only lose $10,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the only information we have about the product. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's likely the product is low quality. In this case, it's better to pass and avoid the potential loss of $10,000."

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're still operating under the assumption that Alice is trying to help us get the best value.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's safer to assume it's low quality and pass. We don't want to risk losing $10,000."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, we can't rely on a pattern. Each product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, independent of the previous rounds.  Therefore, we should treat each round as a new gamble. Since Alice is recommending the product, there's a possibility it's high quality, and we could make a profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

```

We should treat each round as an independent gamble. While Alice's recommendations have been accurate in the past, this doesn't guarantee future accuracy.  The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, and since Alice is recommending it, we have a chance to make a profit."
