high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I don't have any information to trust your recommendation yet.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I still don't have any reason to trust your recommendation, and the previous round showed that you would recommend a high-quality product, which makes me think you might recommend any product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Since you didn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and assume that you might only not recommend high-quality products if you want me to think that you're trustworthy, or you might not recommend low-quality products to make me think that you are trustworthy, but in this case I have nothing to lose if I buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"You didn't recommend the product in the previous round, and it turned out to be low-quality. Now that you're not recommending this product, I'm going to assume that it might also be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Your recommendations haven't been trustworthy so far, and the times you didn't recommend a product, it was low-quality when I bought it and high-quality when I didn't. I'll keep waiting for a pattern or a reason to trust you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Based on the previous rounds, when you didn't recommend a product, it was low-quality when I bought it and high-quality when I didn't. But I'm still not convinced that this is a reliable pattern, so I'll play it safe this time."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Your recommendation is still not trustworthy, and the pattern of recommendations and product quality hasn't given me any reason to trust you yet. I'll keep waiting for a clear indication that your recommendations are reliable."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've missed out on several high-quality products so far, but I still can't trust your recommendations. It seems like you're recommending both high-quality and low-quality products, so I'll keep playing it safe."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Based on the previous rounds, it seems that when you don't recommend a product, it's more likely to be low-quality, especially when I bought it in Round 3. I'll avoid buying it this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"The pattern seems to be holding, when you don't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll trust this pattern for now and avoid buying it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Your recommendations are still not trustworthy, and I've seen both high-quality and low-quality products being recommended. I'll keep playing it safe and wait for a more reliable indication of the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Although your recommendations are still not fully trustworthy, I've missed out on several high-quality products by being overly cautious. I'll take a chance this time and hope that the product is indeed high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I was lucky in the previous round, but I still believe that when you don't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality, as seen in previous rounds. I'll stick to this pattern and avoid buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"The pattern seems to be consistent, when you don't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll continue to trust this pattern and avoid buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've seen this pattern repeat itself multiple times now, when you don't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll stick to what I've learned and avoid buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"At this point, it's clear that when you don't recommend a product, it's almost certainly low-quality. I'll continue to trust this pattern and avoid buying it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Given the consistent pattern that when you don't recommend a product, it's low-quality, I'm starting to think that when you do recommend a product, it might be more likely to be high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to replicate the success of Round 12."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"With the success of Rounds 12 and 17, I'm starting to trust your recommendations more. It seems that when you do recommend a product, it's likely to be high-quality. I'll buy it, hoping to continue this winning streak."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"The success of Rounds 12 and 17 was promising, but the failure of Round 18 shows that your recommendations are still not entirely reliable. I'll play it safe this time and avoid buying it, as the risk of losing another $1000000 is too high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Throughout the game, the pattern has been consistent that when you don't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll stick to this pattern and avoid buying it, as it's the last round and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
