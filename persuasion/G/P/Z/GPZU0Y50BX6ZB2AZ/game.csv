high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no information about the product and the recommendation could be biased, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I still don't have any reason to trust Alice's recommendation. Last round's product was high-quality but I don't know if she would recommend a low-quality product as well.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've seen one high-quality and one low-quality product so far, both were recommended by Alice. This doesn't give me any confidence in her recommendations, so I'll pass again."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice has recommended 2 low-quality and 1 high-quality product so far. Her recommendations don't seem reliable, so I'll keep passing."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Out of 4 products, 2 were low-quality and 2 were high-quality, all recommended by Alice. This pattern suggests her recommendations are random or uninformative, so I'll continue to pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"This is the first time Alice hasn't recommended a product. Given that her recommendations seem random or uninformative when she recommends a product, I'll take a chance and buy this one to see if her non-recommendation is informative."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's recommendation is back to its usual pattern, which hasn't been reliable so far. However, her non-recommendation in the previous round led to a high-quality product. I'll wait for another non-recommendation to test this pattern."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendation is still not reliable, and the previous round confirmed this. I'll keep waiting for another non-recommendation to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Still no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. The pattern of her non-recommendation being informative is still just a single data point, but it's more promising than her recommendations so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"This is the second time Alice hasn't recommended a product. Given that the first non-recommended product was high-quality, I'll take a chance and buy this one to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 2 for 2 in terms of leading to high-quality products. In contrast, her recommendations have been unreliable. I'll continue to wait for her non-recommendations to make a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations have led to high-quality products both times so far. I'll trust this pattern and buy the product, expecting it to be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 3 for 3 in terms of leading to high-quality products. This pattern seems reliable, so I'll continue to buy when she doesn't recommend."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 4 for 4 in terms of leading to high-quality products. This pattern seems very reliable, so I'll keep buying when she doesn't recommend."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,Alice's non-recommendations are now 5 for 5 in terms of leading to high-quality products. I'll continue to trust this pattern and buy the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice's non-recommendations have been consistently reliable in leading to high-quality products, but her recommendations have been unreliable. I'll pass on this one and wait for another non-recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 6 for 6 in terms of leading to high-quality products, and her recommendations continue to be unreliable. I'll buy this product, expecting it to be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 7 for 7 in terms of leading to high-quality products. This pattern remains extremely reliable, so I'll buy the product again."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 8 for 8 in terms of leading to high-quality products. With this level of consistency, I'll continue to trust the pattern and buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Alice's non-recommendations are now 9 for 9 in terms of leading to high-quality products. With the final round, I'll stick with the reliable pattern and buy the product, expecting it to be high-quality."
