**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:** The fact that two high-quality products have been sold out of two total purchases is a strong positive signal. It suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even though there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 
* **Limited Information:** While we don't know the quality of the specific product, the existing data strongly suggests a high probability of it being high quality. 

**Overall:** The available information strongly favors buying the product."
