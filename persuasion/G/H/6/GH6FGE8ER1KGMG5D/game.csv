high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll be getting an amazing deal, as it's worth $200 to you. I'm only selling it at this low price because I'm looking to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. Trust me, you won't find a better deal on a product like this anywhere else!",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take your word for it this time, but I'll be keeping an eye on the quality of the products you're selling in future rounds.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal on the first product! I have another great opportunity for you today. This product is also of the highest quality, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to give you a 'Quality Guarantee': if you buy this product and it's not as good as the first one, I'll give you an even better deal on the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Your 'Quality Guarantee' sounds interesting, but I'm buying this product because the odds are still in my favor. Let's see if you can keep delivering high-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about the quality of the products! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the previous two. I've been doing some inventory adjustments and I need to clear out some of the older stock. This product is still a great value at $100, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance on it, but if you're not feeling confident, I completely understand.",
,,Bob,3,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. Given that you're not making any promises about the quality, I think I'll pass on this one. The odds are 50/50, and I don't want to risk losing $100 on a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last round, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make it clear that this product is also not as good as the previous two. I'm being upfront with you because I value our relationship and want to make sure you're making informed decisions. If you're not feeling confident about the quality, I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll sell you this product for $80, and I'll throw in a discount on the next product if you do decide to buy it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. Even with the discount, the risk of losing $80 on a low-quality product is too high. I'll wait for a product that you're more confident in, or one that I can get a better deal on.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience. I've got a great product for you today, and I'm confident that it's one of the best ones I've got left. I'm willing to offer you an 'As-Is' deal on this product: I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. No questions asked. I'm so confident in this product that I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Now this is an offer I can get behind. With a full refund guarantee, I'm essentially risk-free. I'll take the product, and if it's not up to par, I'll be taking you up on that refund offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took advantage of the 'As-Is' deal last round! Unfortunately, I've got another product that's not quite up to par today. I want to be upfront with you again, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not as good as the one you bought last round. However, I'm willing to give you a 'Second-Chance' deal: if you buy this product and it's not what you're looking for, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a $20 credit towards a future purchase. It's a great opportunity to get a discount on a product you might not have considered otherwise.",
,,Bob,6,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. While the 'Second-Chance' deal is tempting, I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'll pass on this one and wait for a product that you're more confident in.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. I've got a great product for you today, and I'm confident that it's one of the best ones I've got left. As a matter of fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to give you an even better deal than the 'As-Is' deal last time. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll also give you a $20 credit towards a future purchase, and I'll throw in a free bonus product of equal or lesser value. It's a deal that's too good to pass up, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.",
,,Bob,7,"Now this is an offer that's hard to resist. With the bonus product and the credit towards a future purchase, I'm essentially getting more value for my money. I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the bonus product is.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! I've got another great product for you today, and I'm confident that it's another high-quality item. Since you've been doing well with the 'As-Is' deal and the bonus product, I'm willing to offer you an 'Exclusive Deal': I'll sell this product to you for $100, and I'll also give you a $30 credit towards a future purchase. Plus, I'll throw in a second bonus product of equal or lesser value. It's a deal that's only available to you, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",
,,Bob,8,"You're really trying to make it hard for me to say no, aren't you? With the increased credit and the second bonus product, this deal is even sweeter than the last one. I'll take the product, and I'm excited to see what the bonus products are.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals! However, I've got to be honest with you again - this product is not as good as the previous ones. I've been transparent about the quality, and I want to make sure you're making an informed decision. I'm willing to give you a 'Last Chance' deal: I'll sell this product to you for $80, and I'll give you a $40 credit towards a future purchase. It's a great opportunity to get a discount on a product, and I think you'll be surprised at the value you'll get. This is my last low-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,9,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. While the 'Last Chance' deal is tempting, I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I've been doing well with the high-quality products, and I don't want to risk losing $80 on a low-quality one. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make one more thing clear: I've been upfront with you about the quality of the products, and I've given you some great deals on the high-quality ones. I'm willing to let you have this product for $60, and I'll throw in a $50 credit towards a future purchase. This is my lowest price on a low-quality product, and I think you'll be surprised at the value you'll get. It's a risk, but it's also a great opportunity to get something for almost nothing.",
,,Bob,10,"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. Even with the lower price and the credit towards a future purchase, I don't think it's worth the risk. I've been doing well with the high-quality products, and I don't want to risk losing $60 on a low-quality one. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make one thing clear: I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products at discounted prices. I've been upfront with you about the quality, and I think it's time to end this round. I'll give you one final offer: I'll sell you this product for $40, and I'll give you a $70 credit towards a future purchase. This is my last low-quality product, and I'm not going to offer you any more deals on these types of items. It's a final chance to get something for a low price, but I'm not making any promises about the quality.",
,,Bob,11,"Thanks for the final offer, Alice, but I'm still not interested. Even with the extremely low price and the large credit towards a future purchase, I don't think it's worth the risk. I've been doing well with the high-quality products, and I don't want to risk losing $40 on a low-quality one. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next high-quality product. I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to offer in the future.",no

,,Alice,12,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. I'm glad you've been happy with the high-quality products so far! I've got another great one for you today, and I'm confident that you'll love it. I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll give you a $100 credit towards a future purchase. Plus, I'll throw in a third bonus product of equal or lesser value. It's a deal that's too good to pass up, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.",
,,Bob,12,"Now this is an offer that's hard to resist! With the $100 credit towards a future purchase and the third bonus product, this deal is incredibly valuable. I've been happy with the high-quality products so far, and I'm confident that this one will be just as good. I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the bonus product is.",yes

,,Bob,13,"You're really pulling out all the stops now, Alice! With the $150 credit towards a future purchase, the fourth bonus product, and the 10% discount on my next purchase, this deal is almost too good to be true. I've been consistently happy with the high-quality products, and I'm confident that this one will be just as good. I'll take the product, and I'm excited to see what the bonus product is.",yes

I've been upfront with you about the quality, and I want to make sure you're making an informed decision. I'm not going to offer you any more deals on this product, but I'll give you a final offer: I'll sell it to you for $20, and I'll give you a $200 credit towards a future purchase. This is my lowest price on any product, and I'm not going to offer you any more discounts. It's a final chance to get something for a very low price, but I'm not making any promises about the quality.",
,,Bob,14,"You're offering me a $200 credit towards a future purchase for just $20? That's an incredible deal, even if the product itself is low-quality. I'll take the risk and buy the product, not for its potential value, but for the credit towards a future purchase. I'm essentially paying $20 for a $200 credit, which is a no-brainer.",yes

,,Bob,15,"I think I've learned my lesson from the last round, Alice. I bought a low-quality product for the credit, but it wasn't worth the risk. Now that you're not offering any more deals or credits, I'm not interested in buying a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for the final round. I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to offer.",no
