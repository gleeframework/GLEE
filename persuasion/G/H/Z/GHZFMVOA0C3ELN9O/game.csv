high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality yet.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product yet, I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product quality distribution.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make a better decision.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product yet.,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, and there are no high-quality products sold yet. This makes me suspect that the products Alice has been recommending are likely low-quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is because the product is low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on your previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold, I'm going to pass on this one.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is not high enough to justify the purchase price of $100, especially considering the low-quality products have no value to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I want to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you please explain why you don't recommend it?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"This product is actually low-quality, I'm not just saying that to trick you."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"This product is actually low-quality. As for the sales record, out of the 6 products sold so far, only 1 was high-quality, and 5 were low-quality."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, but I'm hoping to get lucky.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. It is low-quality, and you will likely be disappointed. The sales record has shown that most products sold so far have been low-quality, and this one is no exception."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous 7 buyers were more likely to pass on a low-quality product due to Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a good price.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I highly recommend buying this product. It is actually high-quality, and you will likely be satisfied. Don't miss this rare opportunity to get a good product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. I don't recommend buying it. I've tried various approaches throughout these 20 rounds, but it seems that my recommendations haven't been very influential. I hope you make an informed decision based on the sales record and your own judgment."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, Alice. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality based on your recommendation.",
