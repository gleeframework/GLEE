While Bob is justifiably suspicious,  Alice should still recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **Bob's Loss Aversion:**  Bob is likely experiencing loss aversion. He's already passed on two potentially good deals, and the fear of missing out on another one is outweighing the potential gain.  
* **Alice's Advantage:** Alice has a higher chance of selling the product (33.33% chance of a high-quality product) even with Bob's skepticism.

Alice needs to be persistent and continue recommending purchases.  Eventually, the odds will favor her, and Bob might change his mind."
