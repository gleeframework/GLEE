,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a premium item. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not looking to make a quick sale. I'm willing to let it go at a price that's slightly below market value. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I have no prior data to go by. I'm hoping it's high quality, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50%.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the price remains the same as before, but the odds are now slightly in your favor. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the probability is as high as 66.67% and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products so far, and now I'm offering you the next one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had a high-quality product sell, and now I'm trying to sell a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to let you know that this one is likely not as valuable as the previous one. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on your statement about the product being likely not as valuable. I'm considering the overall probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 50%. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 products so far, and now I'm offering you the next one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to point out that I've had two consecutive low-quality products, which might suggest that the probability is actually lower than 50%. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to let you know that the odds are against you. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the increased risk due to the two consecutive low-quality products. I'm willing to take that risk for the potential reward of a $3000000 product. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount on the price, considering the uncertainty. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, say $900000, for this product?",yes

I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 10% discount to the next buyer. This is a one-time offer, so what do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity, as I think the high probability of it being high-quality might be due to a streak, and I don't want to overpay for a product that might not be high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 products so far, and now I'm offering you the next one. The probability of it being high-quality is back to 50%.
