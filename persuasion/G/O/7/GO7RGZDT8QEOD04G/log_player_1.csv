Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Since the product in Round 1 is actually high-quality, and a high-quality product is worth $200 to Bob, it makes sense to recommend buying it. Even though there's a 20% chance it could be low-quality, the potential gain of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Since this round's product is actually low-quality, recommending a purchase would lead to Bob losing $100. It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend the purchase in this round."
