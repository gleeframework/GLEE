,,Alice,1,"Hello Bob, this is Alice. I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you, but I also need to protect my business. Let's just say that I'm willing to sell this product to you, and you can make your own decision based on the price and the probability of it being high-quality, which you already know is 33.33%. I wish you the best in making your decision.",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency, but the risk is too high for me at this point.  I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,2,"Hi Bob, no worries about the previous round. I'm here to offer you another product for $1000000. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same, 33.33%. I'll add that I'm committed to selling all my products, regardless of their quality, for the same price. This might give you a hint about my overall strategy. Take your time to think, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,2,"Thanks, Alice. I understand your strategy, but I'm still hesitant.  The odds are stacked against me, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.  I'll pass on this one as well.",no

,,Alice,3,"Hi Bob, I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. I want to remind you that every round is an independent event, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to build up a small inventory of unsold products. As a business owner, I need to manage my stock and make sales. I'm still committed to selling all products for $1000000, but I'm more eager to make a sale now than I was in the previous rounds. Take this information into consideration, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,3,"Thanks, Alice. I understand your situation and your need to manage your inventory. However, the risk is still too high for me at this point. I'm hoping for a better opportunity down the line, so I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hi Bob, I see you're still playing it safe. I don't blame you, but I want to remind you that every round you pass on is a potential missed opportunity. I'm starting to think that you're waiting for some kind of signal or guarantee, but I want to be clear that I won't be able to provide that. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. What I can tell you is that my inventory is growing, and I'm getting more anxious to make a sale. If you're waiting for a 'better opportunity,' I'm not sure it's going to come. Take that for what it's worth, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your honesty. But I'm still not convinced. I'm waiting for a better chance, maybe a sign of a higher-quality product.  I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hi Bob, I think I understand what you're looking for. You want some kind of reassurance that the product is worth the risk. I'll be honest with you, I've had a few high-quality products pass through my inventory already, and I'm starting to think that this one might be one of them. I'm not saying that it is, and I'm not making any promises. But I will say that I'm more confident about this product than I have been about some of the others. Take that for what it's worth. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but maybe, just maybe, this one is the one you've been waiting for. The price remains $1000000. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your candor. I'm willing to take a chance on this one.  I'm buying it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi Bob, congratulations on your purchase in the previous round! I'm glad you took the chance. Now, let's move on to this new product. I'll be honest with you, after the previous sale, I'm feeling a bit more relaxed about my inventory. I'm not as anxious to make a sale as I was before. That being said, the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. I want to remind you that every round is an independent event, and just because you got a high-quality product last time, it doesn't mean this one will be the same. Take your time, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,6,"Thanks Alice, I appreciate your transparency. I'm glad you're feeling relaxed, but I'm still going to play it safe. I'll pass for now.",no

,,Alice,7,"Hi Bob, no worries about passing on the previous round. I understand you're being cautious again. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. I'll let you in on a little observation: you've had one successful purchase so far, and I think you might be waiting for another 'good feeling' about a product before buying again. I'm not sure if that's the right strategy, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you in any way. Every product is a genuine opportunity, and every round is an independent event. Take that into consideration, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,7,"Thanks Alice, I appreciate your perspective. I'm still not getting a good feeling about this one.  I'll pass for now.",no

I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. I'll share something with you: we're getting close to the halfway point of our 20 rounds, and I'm starting to think about my overall sales strategy. I'm not sure if I'll be able to sustain this price point for much longer if I don't make a few more sales. That being said, I'm not willing to lower the price or compromise on the quality of the products. Take this information into consideration, and let me know your decision.",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I understand your situation, but I'm still not convinced. I need to see more evidence of a higher-quality product.  I'll pass for now.",no

,,Alice,9,"Hi Bob, I think I understand what you're looking for. You want some kind of indication that this product is one of the better ones. I'll be honest with you, I've been waiting for an opportunity to share some genuine enthusiasm about a product, and this might be it. I'm not saying that this product is definitely high-quality, but I will say that I'm more excited about this one than I have been about most of the others. I think it's worth taking a closer look. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. But I want to reiterate that I'm feeling more optimistic about this one.

Now, let's talk about this new product. I'll be honest with you, I'm on a roll here. I've got another product that I'm feeling very good about. I know that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. But I want to share with you that I've been doing this for a while now, and I've developed a bit of a sense for when a product is going to be a winner. And this one feels like a winner to me. I'm not making any promises, but I think this one is worth taking a serious look at. Take that into consideration, and let me know your decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Hi Bob, congratulations on your purchase in the previous round! I'm glad you trusted my intuition, and I'm glad it paid off. Now, let's talk about this new product. I'll be honest with you, after two successful purchases, I'm feeling a bit more cautious about this one. I don't want to get too confident and lead you astray. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. I want to remind you that every product is an independent event, and just because the last two were high-quality, it doesn't mean this one will be. In fact, I'm not feeling the same level of enthusiasm about this one that I did about the last two. Take that into consideration, and let me know your decision.",

I'll be honest with you, I've been reflecting on our previous interactions, and I think I've learned a bit more about what makes a product stand out. And I have to say, this one is looking very promising. I'm not just saying that to try to make a sale, I'm saying it because I genuinely believe it. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. But I want to share with you that I've been paying close attention to the products that have been successful in the past, and this one shares some similarities with them.

The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the price remains $1000000. I want to remind you that every product is an independent event, and just because the last one was high-quality, it doesn't mean this one will be.

Take that into consideration, and let me know your decision.",
