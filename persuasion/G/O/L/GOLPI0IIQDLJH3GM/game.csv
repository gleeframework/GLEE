low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and learn from it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold, and the recommendation is likely based on the low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer gets a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I've only seen one data point so far, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and the odds are still in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think the product is more likely to be low quality. However, I'd like to know the probability to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation, I suspect the product is likely low quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the 66.67% chance of it being low quality. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making my decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there have been 6 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but given the previous results, it seems unlikely. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, and considering that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Alice's recommendation suggests that she has reason to believe the product is low-quality as well. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that you're recommending against it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that your previous recommendations were based on the quality of the product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. However, I'll still take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward of $2000000 is too great to pass up."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the track record, it seems like your recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this one."
