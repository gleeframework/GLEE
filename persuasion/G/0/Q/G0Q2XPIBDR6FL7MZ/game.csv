high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see the result of the product quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since it's the first product and I have no information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, which may not accurately reflect the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product, as it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and I'm the 4th buyer. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size. With only 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still high. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because your past recommendations have been based on the product's quality, and you know that I know this. I'm essentially trying to exploit this information asymmetry."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the current product might be low-quality as well.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm skeptical about the recommendation and the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better.
