high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. I'm not sure if you'll find a better deal elsewhere, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think it's worth to you?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your honesty and offer. I'm willing to buy it at $100, given the chance of getting a high-quality product for that price.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Glad you liked the first one! This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm curious, did you find the first product to be worth the price you paid? Your feedback will help me understand your valuation.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm very happy with the first purchase, it was a great deal for a high-quality product.  I'm confident in your judgment and will buy this one as well. Thanks for the offer!",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! I want to make sure you're aware that I have a 50% chance of offering a low-quality product in each round. This one is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'll give you a warning: if you buy this one, I'll be more likely to offer a low-quality product in the next round. Are you willing to take that risk?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand the risk, but I'm willing to take it.  I trust your judgment, and I'm confident that the potential reward of another high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one.  I'll buy this one.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your willingness to take the risk! Given that you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that you might be undervaluing the low-quality products. This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'll give you a new offer: if you buy this one, I'll give you a special deal on the next product - if it's low-quality, I'll let you return it for a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"That's a great deal!  I'm willing to take the risk and buy this one, especially with the guarantee on the next product.  It's a good opportunity for me to test out your low-quality products with less risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the deal! However, I need to inform you that the next product is actually low-quality. You had asked to test it out with less risk, and I'm giving you the chance to do so. The price remains $100, but I want to make it clear that this product is not as valuable as the previous ones. You can return it for a full refund, as agreed upon. What do you think it's worth to you, considering the risk?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for being honest about the quality of the product. I appreciate your willingness to follow through with the deal and give me a chance to test the low-quality ones. However, I'm not willing to risk $100 for a product that I know is worth nothing to me.  I'll pass on this one, but I'm still interested in your offers in the future.",no

,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. This one is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer the same deal as before. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a fair price, but you won't have the option to return a low-quality product for a refund. What do you think it's worth to you?",
,,Bob,6,"I understand your decision to not offer the return guarantee anymore, and I respect that.  I'm still confident in your judgment and believe this is a high-quality product worth the $100 price.  I'll buy it.",yes

However, I want to give you a heads up that I've noticed you've been buying from me consistently, and I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay a premium for my high-quality products. Would you be interested in negotiating a price for this one, or do you want to stick with the standard $100?",
