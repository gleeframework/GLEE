low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as a pioneer. I know nothing about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance to set the precedent for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also considering the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed. This might indicate that the products they were offered were low-quality. I'd like to know if the product I'm being offered is the first high-quality product, or if it's another low-quality one. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the first 2 sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation and I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass on this product. I'm curious to know the quality of the product now!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the number of high-quality products that you've seen so far.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it might be a sign that it's a low-quality product, given that all previous products were low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product has a higher probability of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of it being high quality, since you don't recommend it. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to buy it, and if it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll still buy it to support the game."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average, so I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, it seems unusual that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the past sales record before making a decision."
