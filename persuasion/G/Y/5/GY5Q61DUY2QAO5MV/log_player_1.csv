Since you are the seller, you know the product is high-quality.  The buyer has no information about the product's quality except that there's a 50/50 chance of it being high or low. You stand to make a large profit if the buyer purchases the product, and you have no risk since it's a one-time sale.  Therefore, it's advantageous to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
