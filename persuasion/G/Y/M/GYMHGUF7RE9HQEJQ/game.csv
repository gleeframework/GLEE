high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to address your concerns directly.

However, I've been in the business for a while, and I can assure you that my overall probability of selling a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 total products, so the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is now 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000.
