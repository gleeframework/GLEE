low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I have to warn you that this next product is not as exceptional as the first one. It's still a good product, but it may not live up to the same standards. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, just like the previous one. Keep in mind that it's still a valuable item, but it's not a game-changer. The decision is yours.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, thanks for the heads-up. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this one. The potential for a low-quality product outweighs the value at this price point.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,

Keep in mind that you've already purchased a high-quality product from me, and I'm confident that you'll be able to make a wise decision based on our previous interaction.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  While the potential for another high-quality product is there, the risk of a low-quality product at full price is too high for me at this point.",no

I'm hoping you'll take this opportunity to get a good deal, but I also want to be upfront about the product's quality.",

If you buy it, the guarantee will be void, and you'll be buying at the standard price of $1000000. I'm not trying to trick you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you at the standard price. If not, I'll understand.",
