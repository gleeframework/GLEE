**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** The probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she knows it's high quality.  While Alice could be wrong, her knowledge gives us additional information.
* **Previous Sales:**  One high-quality product was sold out of one purchase. This reinforces the high probability of high-quality products.
* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $125, while a low-quality product is worth $0.  Even with a 20% risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss.

**Therefore, buying the product is the best strategy in this situation.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a strong signal. She knows the true quality of the product and would only recommend it if it were high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product based on the available information."
