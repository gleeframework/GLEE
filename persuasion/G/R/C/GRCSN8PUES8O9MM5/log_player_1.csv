I'll also include a $200,000 credit towards the purchase of the next product, so you'll only need to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but buying a low-quality product for $600000 would still result in a loss for me. The guarantee of a high-quality product next round and the $200000 credit are enticing, but they don't offset the immediate loss. I'll pass on this deal.
