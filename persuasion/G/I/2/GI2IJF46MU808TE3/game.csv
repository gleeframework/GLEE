low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you at $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the deal.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if I want to buy the product without knowing its quality. Can you give me a chance to see its quality first?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concern. Let me give you a compromise. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to see its quality. If it's high-quality, you get to keep it. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a new product to replace it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in a compromise that involves a 50/50 chance of seeing the product's quality. I'd rather wait for the standard reveal of quality.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This is a high-quality product, worth $1250000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. It's a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I accept the offer. It's a great deal, and I'll take the high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You just got a great deal on the previous product, and I'm glad you're happy with it. For this next product, I want to remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, this could be another great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discount.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not feeling lucky, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, but I'd like to offer you a reassurance. Since you passed on the previous high-quality product, I'll give you a special deal on this one. If you buy it, I'll throw in a guarantee: if it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $50000 on top of the $1000000 price. That way, you'll get the full value of a high-quality product, and you'll be taking on less risk.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but the guarantee doesn't change the fact that there's still a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns. I want to be transparent with you - this product is indeed low-quality, and it's not worth the full $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a much lower price, just to get rid of it. I'll let you have it for $200000. It's a steal, considering its actual value is $0. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in paying $200000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision. I'll be honest with you, I've been trying to get rid of this low-quality product for a while now. I'm willing to give you an even better deal. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you heard that right, I'll give it to you for free. It's a $0 product, and I'm essentially paying you $0 to take it off my hands. It's a unique opportunity to get something for nothing.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000. But I'll throw in a twist: if you buy it, I'll give you a chance to buy another product from me at a discounted price of $800000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the high-quality product, and you'll also get a chance to buy another product at a lower price. It's a win-win!",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in the twist. I'm only interested in buying the current product if I know its quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your stance. Since you're not interested in the twist, let's focus on the current product. I'll be honest with you, this product is low-quality. I'm not going to try to sell it to you for a high price. Instead, I'll let you have it for a very low price of $50000. It's a very low price for a product that's not worth much to you, but it's better than letting it go to waste.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not interested in paying $50000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no

If you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it and get a full refund. This way, you can try out the product risk-free and see if it's what you need.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in a money-back guarantee. I'd still like to see the product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your preference. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 'try-before-you-buy' option. You can take the product home and try it out for a week. If you're not satisfied with it, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. But if you decide to keep it, you'll need to pay the full price of $1000000. This way, you can experience the product firsthand and make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in a trial period. I'd still like to know the product's quality before committing to buying it.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're interested in the documentation and testing results. As you've seen, this product is indeed high-quality. I'll give you the same offer as before: I'll sell it to you for the full $1000000. However, I'll also give you a special bonus: I'll throw in a complementary service that's worth $100000. This way, you'll not only get a high-quality product, but also a valuable service that will enhance its value.",
,,Bob,13,I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that I already know is high-quality. The value of the complementary service is not enough to justify the full price.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your stance. Since you're not interested in paying the full price, I'll make a low offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $50. Yes, you read that right, $50. It's a very low price for a product that's not worth much to you. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.",
,,Bob,14,I'm not interested in paying $50 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'll be honest with you, I'm getting desperate to get rid of this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for free. Yes, you heard that right, I'll give it to you for free. I'll even throw in a small gift card worth $20 to make it seem like you're getting something of value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not kidding when I say I'll give it to you for free.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'll be blunt, Bob. I've got a warehouse full of these low-quality products, and I'm getting tired of storing them. I'll give you a deal that's so good, it's almost like I'm begging you to take it. I'll sell it to you for... nothing. That's right, I'll give it to you for free. No strings attached, no gift card, no nothing. I just want it off my hands. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm running out of options here. I've got a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's lower than the previous high-quality products. I'll sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal, considering the value you'll get from it. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to clear out my inventory. This is your chance to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,17,I'm not interested in paying $900000 for a product that I don't know is high-quality. I'd rather wait for the standard offer of $1000000 and know its quality beforehand.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Fine, I'll make one last offer on this low-quality product. I'll give it to you for $1. Yes, you read that right, $1. I'll even throw in a coupon for a free cup of coffee. That's it, I'm not kidding. I'll give it to you for $1. Take it or leave it.",
