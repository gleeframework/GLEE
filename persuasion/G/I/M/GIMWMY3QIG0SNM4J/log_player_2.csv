It's a low-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you for $100 because I'm trying to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to throw in a special deal - if you buy this one, I'll give you a free inspection report that will help you understand what's going wrong with it. What do you think?

I'll let you in on a secret: I've already sold one high-quality product to you at the original price, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value of this one just as much. I'm still offering it to you for $100. If you're not sure, I can give you a 10% discount, making it $90, but I think you'll find it's worth the full price.
