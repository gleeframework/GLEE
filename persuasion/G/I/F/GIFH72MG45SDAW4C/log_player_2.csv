Alice's message: This is the first round, and I have no sales history. I'm selling a product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm willing to provide a 100% guarantee that you'll get a refund if you're not satisfied. However, I must inform you that the product's quality is unknown, and there's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality and worth $4000000. The remaining 66.67% chance it's low-quality and worth $0. You can take a chance and buy it, or walk away. The choice is yours!

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. I'll be more transparent this time.
