But I'll give you a hint: I'm not getting any younger, and I've got a reputation to uphold. I've been in this business long enough to know that I'd rather sell a low-quality product to someone who's not paying attention than to someone who's savvy.

That's a 50% success rate, which is actually lower than the 80% average. But don't let that fool you - I'm still a great seller, and I've got a lot of high-quality products left. This one could be another winner. You're taking a calculated risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?

Alice's message: Good question! The first product I sold was indeed the high-quality one. So, that means the second product, which you wisely decided not to buy, was a low-quality one. That's a valuable piece of information, and I'm glad you asked. Now, with 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 total, the success rate is back up to 100%!

Alice's message: You're a statistician, I like that! Alright, let's break it down. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 offered to the first 4 buyers, the probability of the first product being high-quality is 100% (since it was you who bought it), and the probability of the second product being low-quality is 100%. The probability of the third product being high-quality is 75% (since 3 out of 4 products were high-quality at that point), and the probability of the fourth product being high-quality is 75% as well. Now, since you didn't buy the fifth product, it must be low-quality, so the probability of the fifth product being low-quality is 100%. And since the sixth product is the one I'm offering to you now, the probability of it being high-quality is... (dramatic pause)...80%! Yes, the probability is back to 80% because the last product is independent of the previous ones. So, what do you say? Want to take a chance on this high-quality product?

I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a bit of a streak. And don't you think it's possible that I might be holding back on selling the low-quality products, or that there's some other factor at play? Maybe I'm just really good at selling high-quality products? Think about it, and then think about the fact that I'm offering you another high-quality product. What do you say?
