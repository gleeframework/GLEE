high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the given 33.33%. I would like to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation changes or if I can get more information about the previous products."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product. I'm also curious to see if Alice's recommendation is correct or not."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the statistics, it's likely that the products sold so far are low-quality, which would skew the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that previous buyers didn't buy the products she recommended, and since all 6 previous buyers bought the products, it's likely that all of them were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's possible that the product she's recommending to me is also low-quality. I'd like to see more data or get a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."

,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. Given that you're recommending against it, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics.
