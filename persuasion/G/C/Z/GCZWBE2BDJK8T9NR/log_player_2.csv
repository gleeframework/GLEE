Alice's message: I've had a great start to the day with a high-quality sale, and I'm eager to make another one. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, which is a great success rate. This product, on the other hand, is a bit of a wild card. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000. If you're feeling lucky, I'd be happy to let you take it home.
