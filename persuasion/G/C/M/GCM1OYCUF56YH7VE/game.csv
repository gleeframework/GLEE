,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a unique product at a discounted price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its rarity. I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if I want to buy it at $100, considering the uncertainty of its quality. Can you give me more information about the product's quality? I'd like to know if it's high or low quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to give you a special deal on this one - I'll sell it to you for the same price of $100. You won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else, I guarantee it!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not convinced. I'd like to know the outcome of the previous product you offered, which was low-quality. Since I passed on it and it was low-quality, I can infer that the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%. Given this information, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I'll buy the product for $80, which is the expected value of a high-quality product minus the 20% chance of it being low-quality.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see what you're doing there, Bob! You're trying to use the law of large numbers to your advantage. I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $80. I know it's worth $120 to you, and I'm not going to give it away at a discount. But I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,3,I accept your compromise. I'll buy the product for $110.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'm glad we could come to an agreement earlier. Now, let's talk about this new product. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before - $110. But this one's even better than the last one! It's a premium product with additional features that will really enhance your experience. Trust me, you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $110. Since I already bought a high-quality product from you for $100, and I know that high-quality products are worth $120 to me, I'm going to make a counteroffer. I'll pay $100 for this product, just like the last one. If you're confident it's worth more, you can reveal its quality and I'll decide then.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're trying to negotiate again, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell this product for $100. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. Since you're a repeat customer, I'll meet you in the middle at $105. But I'll also throw in an exclusive bonus feature that's not available anywhere else. This product is truly a gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $105 for a product that I don't know the quality of. I'd like to propose a different deal. I'll buy the product for $105, but only if you reveal its quality to me before I make the purchase. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $105. If it's low-quality, I'll walk away and we'll start fresh with a new product.",no

,,Alice,6,"Ahah, Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I like that. Alright, I'll take your proposal. And... drumroll please... this product is indeed a low-quality one. I'm surprised you're even considering buying it at this point, but I'll leave the decision up to you. You can take it off my hands for $100, and I'll throw in a small bonus gift to make up for it. It's not the best deal, but it's a decent offer considering the product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the transparency, Alice. Since I already know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'll pass on this offer. I'm not interested in paying $100 for a product that's not worth anything to me.",no
