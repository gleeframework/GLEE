Alice's message: You are considering purchasing a product from a seller with a 50% chance of selling high-quality products. I've already sold 0 products, but I've had a chance to sell two high-quality products in a row. This is a rare coincidence, and it's likely that the next product I sell will be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll be my second customer, and you'll have a chance to beat the odds.

Don't make the same mistake as my previous customer, who bought based on a flawed assumption. This product is definitely not worth $1000000 to me, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out inventory.
