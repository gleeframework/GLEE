Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass on this product.""}

**Explanation:**

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, it's likely that it's low quality. Given the odds (66.67% chance of low quality), it's much riskier to buy than to pass. Passing ensures you don't lose money, while buying has a high chance of resulting in a $1,000,000 loss."
