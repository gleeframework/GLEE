"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows the product is high-quality with a 50% probability, and you've revealed this product is high-quality, there's a strong incentive to buy.  The buyer has no information about your past sales, so this is the only factor to consider.  

**Important note:** This is a simplified model. In a real scenario, the buyer would likely want to gather more information about the product, you as a seller, and your track record before committing to such a large purchase."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer has no knowledge about the current product's quality.  The only information they have is that you sold one product in the previous round, and it was high quality.  This strengthens the belief that the current product is also high quality, making it a good recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I am willing to purchase the product based on your statistics.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. You've sold two high-quality products in a row, which might lead the buyer to believe you're more likely to offer high-quality products. However, you know this product is low-quality. 

It's crucial to be honest with the buyer. Recommending the purchase of a low-quality product for $10,000 would likely damage your reputation and future sales. 

Since the buyer is already aware of your previous sales, it's best to be transparent about the risk involved in buying a low-quality product. You could even try to negotiate a lower price or offer a different product instead."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this product.

**Reasoning:**

**Possible Message:**
