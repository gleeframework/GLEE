,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited to build trust with me! However, I want to be transparent with you. As you've just experienced, even a high-quality product can be a risk. I'm offering you another opportunity to take a chance. This product is also a high-quality one, and I'm confident it will be worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $10000. I'm taking a risk by selling to you again, but I believe in the value of this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm thrilled to take another chance with you, Alice! I believe in the value of the product and your willingness to be transparent. I'm willing to take the risk again and buy the product for $10000.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take another chance, Bob! However, I want to make sure you're making an informed decision. Given that you've already purchased two products from me, and both were high-quality, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you inspect it and it's high-quality, you can buy it for $10000. If it's low-quality, you can walk away with no purchase. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to take the chance, Bob! However, I need to inform you that the inspection option is only available for this round. For the next product, I'll be reverting to the original offer. Considering your previous experiences, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I've taken extra precautions to ensure its quality, and I'm confident it will be worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $10000. Please consider this a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the inspection option being a one-time thing. However, given my previous experiences, I'm not willing to take the risk again without being able to inspect the product. I'm going to pass on this offer and wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your decision to wait for a better opportunity. However, I'd like to offer you a compromise. If you're willing to consider purchasing this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if it's low-quality. This way, you'll only lose $9000 instead of the full $10000. I'm willing to take on this risk to get the product off my hands. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. The potential refund is not enough to make up for the potential loss. I'll continue to wait for a better opportunity.",no

This way, you'll only lose $9000 instead of the full $10000. I'm willing to take on this risk to get the product off my hands. Additionally, I'll throw in a free inspection option, just like in Round 3, so you can verify the product's quality before making a decision. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I'm glad I took the risk and bought the previous product, and I appreciate the second-chance deal you're offering. The 10% refund and free inspection option make it a more appealing offer. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality again.",yes
