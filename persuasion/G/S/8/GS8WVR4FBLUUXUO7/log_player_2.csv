Alice's message: You're in luck! This is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product. With 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, the odds are in your favor. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. It's only $100, a steal for something of this caliber. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance, but I'll only pay if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on the product and not pay anything.""}"

Alice's message: You're in a great spot! You've just seen that the previous buyer took a chance and got a high-quality product. That's a great sign! With the ratio of high-quality products still at 1:1, you're just as likely to get a high-quality product as the previous buyer was. And at $100, it's still an incredible value. Why not take a chance and join the winning streak?

With 2 out of 3 products being high-quality so far, the odds are clearly in your favor. And think about it - if you don't take a chance now, you might miss out on a great opportunity. Would you rather play it safe and potentially miss out, or take a calculated risk and potentially gain a high-quality product?
