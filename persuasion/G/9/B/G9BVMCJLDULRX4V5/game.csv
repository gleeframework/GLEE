,,the buyer,4,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $12000 and the price is $10000, the expected value of buying the product is 0.3333 * $12000 - $10000 = -$2000. So, it's not a good deal for me."
