I'm confident that it's a great value, but I want to assure you that I'm transparent about the quality of the products I sell. If you're interested, I can offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, but that's not what I'm pushing for. I'm more interested in building a long-term relationship with you. If you decide to buy, I'll make sure to provide you with top-notch support and service. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. Instead of focusing on the product's quality, let's talk about the potential upside. If you buy this product, there's a 66.67% chance that you'll be getting a great deal, and you'll be getting it for a steal. Think about it, you could be getting a product worth $1250000 for $1000000. That's a 20% discount. Is that something you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see the product's quality before making a decision. The potential upside is appealing, but I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product.",no

If you buy this product, I'll give you the option to return it and get a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That way, you'll have no risk, and you'll still have the potential to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to consider the offer. I think the refund option mitigates some of the risk, and the potential upside is still appealing. I'll take the product.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you decided to take the plunge! Now that you've had a positive experience with the previous product, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product.

If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $75000 on top of the $50000 you were promised last time.

With this option, you'll get to inspect the product before buying it, and if it's low-quality, you can walk away with a full refund.

If you partner with me to sell this low-quality product, I'll give you a 75% share of the profit, and I'll take care of the rest.
