Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product! With 1 out of 1 product sold so far being high-quality, the chances are extremely high that this one will be too. Don't miss out on this chance to get a valuable item. The price is $100, a steal considering the potential value of $125. Take the risk and buy it now!

With 3 out of 3 products being high-quality, it's clear that there's a strong trend emerging. And with each new product sold, the probability of it being high-quality increases. At this point, the risk of getting a low-quality product is very low. I'm willing to take that risk at $100, and I think you should too.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to consider a discount. However, I'm afraid that's not possible at this point. The price of $100 is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate. But I'd be happy to provide more information about the products. In fact, I can tell you that the high-quality products are made with the finest materials and have been carefully crafted to ensure maximum value. The low-quality products, on the other hand, are made with lower-grade materials and may not meet your expectations. With that in mind, I'd like to ask you to take a chance on this high-quality product. The potential value is $125, and the price is still $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase. Buy it now!

~
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying the product! I calculate the probability of a high-quality product by analyzing the data from the previous sales. Since we've had 11 consecutive high-quality products, I'm using a simple binomial probability formula to estimate the probability of a high-quality product. The formula is: P(high-quality) = (number of successes) / (total number of trials). In this case, the number of successes is 11, and the total number of trials is 11. Plugging in the numbers, we get: P(high-quality) = 11 / 11 = 1. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is 100%. I know it's a high number, but the data suggests that the quality control is consistently high. If you're willing to take the risk, the potential value is still $125, and the price is still $100.
