Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: if I were in your shoes, I'd want to know the product's quality before buying too. But think about it this way: if you buy now, you'll not only get the product at a discounted price, but you'll also get a guarantee from me that I'll give you an additional $50000 if the product turns out to be low-quality.

However, if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000.
