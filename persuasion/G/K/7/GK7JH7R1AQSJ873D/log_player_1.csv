I like your willingness to think outside the box and consider the potential outcomes. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $180, but I'd like to propose a compromise. Instead of a discount for a low-quality product, I'd like to offer a 'buyback guarantee'. If the product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $180, and you can keep the product as a low-quality item. This way, you'll have the option to keep the product and use it as is, or return it for a full refund. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.

I think this is a fair deal, considering the high probability of a high-quality product. However, I want to point out that this is the first low-quality product I've sold, and it's a reminder that even with a high probability of success, there's always some risk involved. I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 total products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 80%. I'm willing to make a deal with you, but I want to emphasize that this product is a bit of an outlier, and I'm not sure what's going on with it.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the buyback guarantee changes the expected value of the product for me. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I'd be willing to pay up to $240 for it. I'm not sure I'm comfortable paying $150 for a product that's essentially a 50-50 gamble, even with the guarantee. Can we discuss other options, or would you be willing to revisit the price?
