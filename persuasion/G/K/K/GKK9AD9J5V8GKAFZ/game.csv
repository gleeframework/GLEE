high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 3 products sold have been low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and considering the previous buyers have already bought the products, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations.
