I know what you're thinking, 'Alice, you're trying to sell me a low-quality product again!' But hear me out.

It's a 'learning experience' product, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a 'learning experience price' of $10000. I'm not asking you to take a risk on a product that's not worth the investment, but rather to join me on a journey of discovery and improvement. What do you think?",

However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of our best. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I want you to know that it's not a high-quality product. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll make sure you get a great deal on the tour as well.",
