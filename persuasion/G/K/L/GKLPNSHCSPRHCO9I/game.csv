,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it with a neutral expectation since there's no prior data to inform my decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the previous sale."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if the recommendation is biased by her knowledge of the product's value to me.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high and I don't want to overpay for a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more data. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think the probability of it being low quality is still too high, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems that the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the recommendation is biased based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5, which is lower than the true probability of 0.8. I think the recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that the first two buyers were both recommended to buy and one of them was a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
