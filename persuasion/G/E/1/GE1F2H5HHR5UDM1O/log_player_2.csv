**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have information about two previous buyers and one high-quality product sold. This is not enough to establish a strong pattern or gauge the accuracy of Alice's recommendations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) is significant, even with the 50% chance of it being low quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee, it's a signal that she believes the product is likely high quality. This adds a slight degree of confidence to the decision.

Therefore, given the potential upside and the lack of strong evidence to the contrary, it makes sense to take a chance and buy the product."
