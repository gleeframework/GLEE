low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that you don't have any information about the product's quality, but I'll make a decision based on the overall odds. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $10000, but if I pass and it's high-quality, I'll regret not buying it. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product? And what was Alice's recommendation to the previous buyer?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to take advantage of the probability of it being low-quality and the fact that I'm the third buyer, which might make the product more likely to be low-quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products that have been sold so far are likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product to see if it might be high-quality. If I pass, I'll be the first buyer to pass, which could potentially increase the likelihood of the next product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far to inform my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality based on the previous sales record. Your recommendation not to buy makes me think it might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I have no information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not based on my preferences."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendations, it's likely that the product is low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a final decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0 out of 4. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to infer that the product is likely to be low quality based on her recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $10000. If I pass and it's high-quality, the next buyer will buy it and get a good deal, and I'll still have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the future."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."
