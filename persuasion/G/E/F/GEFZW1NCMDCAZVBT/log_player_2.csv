"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Value:** Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, and a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to you, the expected value of buying is: 0.8 * $12,500 + 0.2 * $0 = $10,000. This is equal to the price, making it a neutral decision. 
* **Decision:**  It's a neutral decision, but since you have no other information, it's best to buy and learn from the outcome. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are not biased. If Alice has any knowledge about the products or is trying to manipulate your decisions, this strategy might not be optimal."
