Since you've already taken advantage of the guarantee once and got a high-quality product, I'll let you know that I'm willing to sell this one to you for $80. I'm doing this because I want to give you a chance to get a good deal on a product that might not be as valuable to you as the previous one. But keep in mind that I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100 if you're willing to take the risk.

I'm doing this because I want to give you a slightly better deal than the previous low-quality product, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it. Again, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100 if you're willing to take the risk.

I'm essentially giving you a discount on a product that's not as valuable to you, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it. Again, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100 if you're willing to take the risk.
