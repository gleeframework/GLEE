,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that the first product was low-quality, and I'm hoping to catch the next high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high quality, even if it goes against your advice."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. Your recommendation is suspiciously low, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the seller's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, given that 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite the high likelihood of low-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products recommended by you were low-quality. I will not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and the statistics of 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record. If it's low, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation because I'm trying to estimate the probability of a high-quality product being available. If I were to assume that your recommendation is based on a perfect understanding of the product's quality, I'd expect the probability of a high-quality product to be around 33.33%. However, given that 7 buyers have passed on the product, I'll assume that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
