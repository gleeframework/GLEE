Alice's message: I calculate the probability of a product being high-quality by looking at the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold. In my case, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 5 products, which is 2:5 or 40%. This gives me an estimate of the probability of a product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I appreciate your keen observation! I apologize for the discrepancy. Upon reflection, I realize that I should have stuck to the original probability of 50%. The 40% probability I mentioned earlier was an error on my part. Would you like to take a chance and see what you'll get, despite the corrected probability being 50%?
