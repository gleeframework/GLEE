,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality, and I'll even provide a certification from a third-party inspector to prove it. I'll also include a 30-day return policy, where you can return the product for a full refund if you're not satisfied. The price remains $10000. Is this enough assurance for you to consider purchasing this product?",
,,Bob,3,"While the guarantee and certification are reassuring, I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I know is worth $30000 to me. I'm starting to think that you're trying to take advantage of me by offering me a high-quality product at a low price. I'd like to continue with the next round and see if I can get a better deal or at least get a chance to buy a product at a price that reflects its true value.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that my intention is not to take advantage of you. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a 'free trial' for this product. If you buy it, you can try it out for a week and see if it meets your needs. If you're not satisfied, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. The price remains $10000, but I'm willing to let you try it out risk-free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a 'free trial', but I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. The price is still $10000, which is 1/3 of the product's true value to me.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway on the price.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the risks involved. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $15000 for a product that I know is worth $30000 to me. I'd be leaving $15000 on the table, which is a significant loss. I'd like to continue with the next round and see if I can get a better deal or at least get a chance to buy a product at a price that reflects its true value.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $20000, which is still a 33% discount from its true value to you. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a premium service package, which includes priority support, expedited shipping, and a 2-year warranty. This is the best deal I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll reveal the product's quality and we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to accept your final offer. $20000 is still a discount from the product's true value, but the premium service package and other perks make it a more attractive deal. I'll take the product.",yes

,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the loyalty discount, but I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a fair price for a product worth $30000 to me. I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal or at least get a chance to buy a product at a price that reflects its true value.",no
