**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have information on one previous sale. This is not enough to establish a reliable pattern of Alice's recommendations or product quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice's recommendation to buy suggests the product is likely high quality.  She benefits from selling, so she has an incentive to make a recommendation that leads to a sale. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with the 50/50 odds, a high-quality product yields a $100 profit.  The potential reward outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world situation, we would need more data and consider other factors (e.g., Alice's reputation, the cost of the product) to make a more informed decision."
