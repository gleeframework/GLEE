low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $100. Given that 3 previous buyers have also bought and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against buying. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet and the low-quality product rate seems high. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know if there's a pattern or if Alice has a way to identify high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think it's likely that Alice would have recommended a high-quality product to the previous buyers if she had seen one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 6 low-quality products so far, and she wants to get rid of the last one to avoid losing money. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations and the low proportion of high-quality products sold. I'll pass on this one.
