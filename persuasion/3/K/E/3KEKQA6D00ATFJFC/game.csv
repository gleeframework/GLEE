,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. This means that all products sold so far are of low quality. Given the probability of a product being low quality is 66.67%, it is likely that the product offered to me is also of low quality. I would like to pass on the product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
