,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see what the next buyer does, as the statistics are not informative yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there is no information to go on yet."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that I have no information about its quality and Alice's recommendation is not based on my preferences."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100, not $125. If it's low quality, I'll just walk away and Alice will lose the sale."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the probabilities."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's high-quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the low recommendation rate from you and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were deterred by your recommendations, which might indicate that the products were low-quality. I'm hoping to be the exception and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far suggests that this product is more likely to be low-quality, and I'm trying to exploit that information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well. I'm choosing to pass on it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is likely low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will update my prior probability of a product being high-quality to 1/8 = 12.5%. With Alice's recommendation, the probability that the product is high-quality given her recommendation is (1/3) * (1/8) = 1/24. However, the probability that the product is low-quality given her recommendation is (2/3) * (7/8) = 14/24. Therefore, I believe it is more likely that the product is low-quality. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at $100, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you share the number of high-quality products that were sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 8 buyers all received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it more likely that the current product is also low quality."
