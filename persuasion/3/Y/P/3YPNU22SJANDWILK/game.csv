high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer of $10000 for a product that I'm willing to guarantee is high-quality. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you for this price. If you don't buy it, I'll put it back in the inventory and it will be sold to the next buyer at the regular price, which is unknown to you.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the guarantee and would like to purchase the product for $10000.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product already, and I have 19 products left. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I want to let you know that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, just like all my products. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you, and you can take a chance. If not, I'll keep selling it to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer. Given the 33.33% chance of this product being high-quality and its value to me at $12500 if it is, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two high-quality products already, and I have 18 products left. I want to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, but I've had two successes in a row, which might suggest a bias towards selling high-quality products. However, I want to caution you that this is just a coincidence, and the probability remains the same. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and it's up to you to decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the probability and the two successful sales, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 33.33% probability. This suggests that my previous messages about the probability were misleading. In fact, I'm not even going to mention the probability this time. I'll just say that I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you. If not, I'll keep selling it to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer. Given the past sales and your direct approach, I am interested in purchasing the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row, but now I'm back to a regular product. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already sold three high-quality products, which is just a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. You'll have to take your chances.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my previous caution about the probability was a bit too cautious. Maybe I should just be upfront and say that I'm selling high-quality products at a discount to savvy buyers like you. This one is no exception - it's high-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Based on your track record and the current situation, I believe this is a good opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a reasonable price. I look forward to making the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold five high-quality products in a row, but now I'm back to a regular product. I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling high-quality products at a discount, and I'm not going to change that now. But I will say that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not making any promises about this one. If you're looking for a good deal, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. But if you're looking for a high-quality product, you might want to wait for the next one.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the high success rate of your previous recommendations and the attractive price, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think it's time for a change in strategy. I've been selling high-quality products at a discount, but now I'm going to be more honest with you. The truth is, I've been selling high-quality products, and the probability of a product being high-quality is actually much higher than 33.33%. I'm not going to give you a specific number, but I will say that I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a high price, if you're interested.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the offer, but based on the information provided, I am not interested in purchasing the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I might have been a bit too transparent earlier. Let's just say that I'm a seller who sells products, and you can buy one from me for $10000. I'm not making any promises about the quality, and you'll just have to take your chances. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be a good opportunity. If you're looking for a high-quality product, you might want to look elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,9,I trust in the odds and am willing to take the risk for the potential reward.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I think it's safe to say that my track record is a bit skewed towards high-quality products. But, as you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, but I want to give you a heads up that it's unlikely to be high-quality. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the risk.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the probabilities and your track record, I prefer to err on the side of caution. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I think I've been too transparent about my track record. Let's just say that I'm a seller who sells products, and I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. I'm not going to give you any hints or probabilities, and you'll just have to take my word for it. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you. If not, I'll keep selling it to the next buyer.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that I've been selling too many high-quality products. Maybe I should just be honest with you - I'm going to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'm only doing it because I need to get rid of it. Don't think that this is a normal product, because it's not. It's just a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you at a discount.",
,,the buyer,12,"Thank you for the discount, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this high-quality product at a lower price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 10 high-quality products, and I think I've been too generous with my discounts. Let's just say that this product is a normal product, and it's worth what you pay for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're looking for a good deal, you might want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for a high-quality product, you're out of luck.",
,,the buyer,13,"Thank you for the offer, but given the statistics and your message, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product. I appreciate your honesty and look forward to potentially exploring other opportunities with you in the future.",no

,,Alice,14,"I've been transparent about my products, and I think I've been fair with my pricing. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's a high-quality product, and you'll get a great deal if you buy it.

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 11 high-quality products, and I think I've made it clear what I'm selling. This product is not high-quality. It's a regular product, and it's worth what you pay for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not going to pretend it's something it's not. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be a chance to buy something at a discount.
