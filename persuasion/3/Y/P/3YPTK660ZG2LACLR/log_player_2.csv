**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation suggests it is likely high quality.
* **The statistics:**  The statistics show that 50% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This reinforces the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **The potential gain:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $100. However, there's a good chance of gaining $25 ($125 value - $100 price). 

**Overall:**  The potential gain outweighs the risk, and the recommendation and statistics provide good evidence that the product is likely high-quality."

* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of each product. It's highly likely she is recommending the product because she knows it's high quality.
