,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on yet."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the previous buyers' decisions. Given the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality sales, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging purchases. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your previous recommendation. I want to understand the logic behind it."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their decisions?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take the opposite action and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, which suggests that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, but I'm also hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the fact that you're recommending against it makes me think it's more likely to be high quality, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you were low-quality, but I think this changes the probability of the current product being high-quality. Given the low-quality products have been recommended, I'm hoping the 8th product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have also passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
