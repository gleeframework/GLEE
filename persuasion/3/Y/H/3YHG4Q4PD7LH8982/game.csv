,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'll take the risk and hope it's worth $2000000 to me."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect that the product is low-quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the situation and get a good deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous three purchases, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and we've seen three low-quality products in a row, it's possible that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm suspicious that all 3 products they were offered were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality."
