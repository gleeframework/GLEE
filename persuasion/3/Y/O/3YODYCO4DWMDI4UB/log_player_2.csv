"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to you, it's worth the risk of buying. Even if it's low quality, you're only out $10,000. However, if it's high quality, you make a $2,500 profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I trust your judgement.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round resulted in a successful purchase of a high-quality product, making Alice's recommendations seem reliable.  While there's still a 50% chance of a low-quality product, the potential for a $2,500 profit outweighs the potential $10,000 loss."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she knows the quality of the product and has correctly recommended high-quality products in the past, her lack of recommendation suggests this product is likely low quality. Therefore, it's best to pass and avoid the risk of losing $10,000."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's last recommendation was incorrect, her overall track record is still positive.

It's still a risk, but the potential $2,500 profit outweighs the possible $10,000 loss."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator, but it's the first time she's advised against buying. Her previous perfect record makes this decision a tough one. However, the risk of losing $10,000 is too high to justify a purchase without more information.

**Reasoning:**
