,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had a 100% success rate so far, and I'm proud to say that every product I've sold has exceeded expectations. However, I'm willing to take a calculated risk with this one.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the chances of it being high-quality are slim.",
