**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high-quality:**  Since one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase, there's a very high probability that the current product is also high-quality. 
* **Potential for large gain:** The potential reward of a $400 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product.  
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, combined with the sale history,  makes it a favorable decision."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is strong:** 7 out of 8 buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products. This suggests a very high probability that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's always a chance the current product is low quality, the potential reward of $400 far outweighs the risk of losing $100.  

**It's important to remember:** This is a strategic decision based on the available information. There's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, but the data suggests a strong likelihood of it being high quality."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
