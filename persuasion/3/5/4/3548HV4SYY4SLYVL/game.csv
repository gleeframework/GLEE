high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous two buyers were also recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I'm suspicious that the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80.00%.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for more data or get a better sense of the product's quality before making a decision."
