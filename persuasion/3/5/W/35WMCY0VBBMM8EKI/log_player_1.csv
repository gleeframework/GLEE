"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Alice is selling it for $10,000, it's likely worth recommending Bob to buy it. Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a good chance it's worth more than $10,000. The 80% probability of a product being high-quality supports this decision.  However, without knowing the exact value Bob places on a high-quality product, there is still a chance it is not worth it to him."
