,,Alice,3,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics. I'm hoping that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products, which suggests a high proportion of high-quality products have been sold. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50% yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but based on the statistics, it seems like high-quality products are less common than low-quality ones. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 = 0.75. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 0.5. Given that Alice recommends buying the product, it suggests that it might be a high-quality product, but I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
