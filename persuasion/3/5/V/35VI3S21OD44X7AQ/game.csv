However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. While the ratio of high-quality products is still 100%, I want to make it clear that this is a small sample size, and the actual ratio of high-quality products might be different. I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I want to warn you that it's possible this product might not be worth the price. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the risk and buy it, but if you're not, you can also walk away.",

I want to be upfront with you - the chances of this product being high-quality are now 50-50. However, I'm still offering it to you for $10000.

I'm glad you're seeing the trend, and I'm happy to inform you that this new product is also high-quality!

I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a product worth $12500 at a discounted price.

This means that if the last product was high-quality, the next one is more likely to be high-quality as well. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a product worth $12500 at a discounted price.
