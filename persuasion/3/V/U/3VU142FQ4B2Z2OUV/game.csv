high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there have been 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is very low. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to buy, it's possible that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. With 1 sale and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you've recommended it, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%, which is not enough to justify a purchase at $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended it. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll wait for the next product."
