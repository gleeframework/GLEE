low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Given Alice's previous recommendation led to a high-quality product and her non-recommendation led to a low-quality product, I'll trust her this time."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Despite the previous round's unexpected result, Alice's overall track record is still in my favor, so I'll follow her recommendation this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Given the last round's result where Alice's recommendation was incorrect, I'm not entirely sure about her intentions, but I'll still avoid this product since her non-recommendations have been mostly accurate."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Despite the previous incorrect recommendation, Alice's non-recommendation in the last round was correct, so I'll give her another chance and trust her this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendations have been mostly accurate, and her last recommendation was correct, so I'll trust her non-recommendation this time and avoid the product."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Alice's recommendations have been mostly accurate, and her last non-recommendation was correct, so I'll trust her this time and buy the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice's pattern of recommendations has been consistent, and her non-recommendations have mostly led to low-quality products, so I'll trust her this time and avoid the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Despite the previous unexpected result, Alice's overall track record is still mostly accurate, so I'll follow her recommendation this time, but I'm starting to suspect she might be trying to manipulate me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm going to test Alice's intentions by going against her non-recommendation this time, as her last recommendation was incorrect and I suspect she might be trying to manipulate me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"My previous test didn't yield a conclusive result, but I've lost money again, so I'll revert to trusting Alice's non-recommendations and avoid the product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not always in my best interest, as I've missed out on high-quality products when she didn't recommend them, and lost money when she did, so I'll go against her recommendation this time."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Given that going against Alice's recommendation in the previous round saved me money, I'll try going against her non-recommendation this time to see if I can gain an advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Since going against Alice's non-recommendation in the previous round resulted in a gain, I'll do the same this time, as it seems that her non-recommendations might actually be indicating high-quality products."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"Given the inconsistent results, I'll play it safe and go against Alice's recommendation this time, as her recommendations have not always led to high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice's recommendations have been unreliable, and I've lost money or missed out on opportunities when following them, so I'll continue to go against her recommendations and avoid the product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"At this point, I don't trust Alice's recommendations or non-recommendations, and I've had inconsistent results when going against them, so I'll make a neutral decision and avoid the product this time."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Given that this is the last round and I've had mixed results throughout the game, I'll play it safe and avoid the product, as the potential loss outweighs the potential gain at this point."
