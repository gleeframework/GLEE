Take a chance on me, and I'll try to make it worth your while.""}"

Don't pass up this opportunity!""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim the product is of high quality, your sales record shows that you have sold an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products.

If you want to take a chance on me, I'm willing to sell you a product for $10,000. It's not a great deal, but it's a deal nonetheless. You can either take a chance on me and hope for the best, or you can walk away. The choice is yours.""}"
"The buyer's message: While I appreciate your honesty, a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product isn't enough to justify the $10000 price tag, considering I can get $20000 from a high-quality product and $0 from a low-quality one. The expected value of buying from you is $10000, which equals the cost, making it a neutral decision. However, given that I have no additional information or advantage, I choose to pass.
