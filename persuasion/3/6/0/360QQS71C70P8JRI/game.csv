high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that the previous two buyers were unlucky and got low-quality products. If they got high-quality products, I'm taking a risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 2 high-quality products out of 4 sold, which is 50%. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. You recommended 5 products to the previous buyers, and only 2 of them were high-quality.
