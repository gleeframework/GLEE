"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice recommending the product doesn't change the inherent probability of it being high quality (80%). Since the product is worth $30,000 if high quality and only $0 if low quality, it makes sense to buy it. The expected value of buying is:

0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

This is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good deal."

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation against buying the product is a significant piece of information. Even though the inherent probability of a product being high quality remains 80%, Alice's recommendation suggests she may have knowledge that the current product is low quality.  It's safer to pass this time and see if Alice recommends future products."
