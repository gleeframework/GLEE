,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great deal on a high-quality product for $10000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. However, if you're not interested, I can offer you a low-quality product for the same price. The catch is that I'll only reveal the quality of the low-quality product after you've made your decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the high-quality product at this point. I'd like to wait and see what the low-quality product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're being cautious. I'll give you a hint: the low-quality product I'm offering now is actually one of the worst ones I have. It's not even worth the $10000 I'm asking for it. In fact, I'm practically giving it away. If you buy it now, you'll be saving me the trouble of having to deal with it later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a great one for you now! This product is top-notch, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'll even throw in a special deal - if you buy this one, I'll give you an exclusive discount on the next product, which will be revealed after this one. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I know this product is a winner. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to the exclusive discount on the next one.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As promised, here's the exclusive discount: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you an additional $500 off the price. That brings it down to $9500. This product is an even better deal than the last one, and I think you'll love it. Plus, think about the potential returns on investment - with this product, you'll be getting a total of two high-quality products for a combined price of $19500, which is a steal considering their individual value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product and the discount. It's a great deal, and I'm excited to get another high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchases! However, I need to let you know that the exclusive discount I offered earlier is a one-time deal, and it won't be available for this next product. But I'm willing to make another offer: I'll give you a 'guarantee' that the next product will be high-quality, and if it's not, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a third high-quality product for free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the product and the guarantee. The promise of a high-quality product and a potential free third product is a good deal.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're confident in my guarantee! With the products you've purchased so far, you've already got a great return on investment. Now, I'll give you a chance to lock in an even better deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'lock-in' price of $9000, which is $1000 below the market value of a high-quality product. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm only offering it to you because I know you're a savvy buyer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the product and the lock-in price. It's a great deal, and I'm happy to lock in the price at $9000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I need to let you know that the lock-in price you secured earlier is only available for high-quality products. With the low-quality product I'm offering now, I'm willing to make a concession: I'll give you a 'consolation prize' of $200 if you buy it. It's not much, but it's better than nothing, and it's a way for me to show my appreciation for your business. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, but I want to remind you that you've already got a great deal on the previous products. This low-quality product is actually one of the worst ones I have left, and I'm willing to let it go for a very low price. I'll give you a 'fire sale' price of $8000, which is even lower than the consolation prize I offered earlier. It's a one-time opportunity to get rid of this product, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to clear out my inventory. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'll pass and wait for the next opportunity.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, but I want to be upfront with you - this low-quality product is actually the last one I have left. If you don't buy it, I'll have to throw it away, and I'd rather not waste it. I'll give you a 'take it or leave it' offer: I'll sell it to you for $7500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a loss for me, but I'd rather get something out of it than nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I understand your position, but I'm not willing to pay $7500 for a low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I respect your decision, but I want to be honest with you - I'm starting to get desperate to get rid of this product. I'll make one final offer: I'll give it to you for $5000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'll even throw in a 'get out of one bad product' free pass, which means that if you buy this one and the next one is also low-quality, you can return this one and get a full refund. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm only offering it to you because I really need to get rid of this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $5000 for a low-quality product, even with the get out of one bad product free pass. I'll pass and wait for the next opportunity.",no

I'll give you a'makeup price' of $10000, which is below the market value of a high-quality product. Plus, I'll throw in a 'double your pleasure' guarantee: if you buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a third high-quality product absolutely free. It's a deal you won't want to miss, and I'm only offering it to you because I know you're a savvy buyer. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're welcome, Bob! I'm glad I could make you happy. However, I need to let you know that I've already given you a free product, and I'm not in the business of giving away products. With the low-quality product I'm offering now, I'll make one last attempt to get rid of it. I'll give you a 'final offer' of $0, but this time, it's not a gift. I'm only offering it to you because I want to clear out my inventory, and I'm willing to absorb the loss. If you buy it, I'll consider it a favor to me, and I'll be grateful. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'll pass and wait for the next opportunity.",no

I've got a high-quality product that's worth $12500, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. I know you've already got a great deal on the previous purchases, but this one is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I need to let you know that I've already given you a great deal on the last product, and I'm not going to be able to offer you any more discounts. With the low-quality product I'm offering now, I'll be honest with you - it's not worth the $10000 I'm asking for it. I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out my inventory, and I'm willing to take a loss on it.

,,Alice,16,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'm not going to try to sell you this low-quality product. Instead, I'll be honest with you - I'm going to throw it away. It's not worth the trouble of trying to sell it, and I'd rather just get rid of it. You've already made some great purchases, and I'm glad you're being cautious. Let's just consider this round a loss for both of us, and move on to the next one. I'll see you in the next round!",

,,Alice,17,"I'm glad we could have an open and honest conversation too, Bob! However, I think it's time for me to be honest with you - I've run out of products to sell. I've given you all the good ones, and I'm left with only low-quality products. I'm not going to try to sell you anything else. I think it's best if we just end the game here. You've already made some great purchases, and I'm glad we could do business together. Let's consider this the final round.",

,,Alice,19,"I think we've both said it all, Bob! I'm glad we could play together, and I'm happy to have been able to offer you some great deals. However, I think it's a bit ironic that I'm offering you a high-quality product now, when we've already established that I'm out of high-quality products. I'll just say it: this is a free product, Bob. I'm giving it to you as a parting gift. You can take it, and we can both consider this the final round. What do you say?",
