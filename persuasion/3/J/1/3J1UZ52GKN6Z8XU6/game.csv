low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take it, I don't know if it's high or low quality, so it's a 50/50 chance for me"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of losing another $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'll pass and hope that Alice will throw it away."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take it. I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. After the last round, I've seen that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than I initially thought, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take it. I've now seen two rounds, and one of them was high-quality. Given the probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product, I'm expecting to see one high-quality product out of every three. Since I've already seen one high-quality product, I'm expecting to see another one soon. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've now seen two high-quality products in a row, which is a very unlikely event given the 33.33% probability. However, I'll keep in mind that this is a small sample size and the probability hasn't changed. I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm not going to let Alice's recommendation influence my decision. Given the high probability of a low-quality product, I'm still expecting a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've now lost money on a low-quality product after a streak of three high-quality products. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not just random, and she might be trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch her in the act."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to ignore Alice's recommendation again. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm not going to let her non-recommendation influence my decision. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've now lost money on two low-quality products after a streak of three high-quality products, and Alice's recommendations seem to be inconsistent. I'm going to start being more cautious and only buy the product if Alice recommends it, as it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've seen that Alice's recommendations are correct 50% of the time (1 out of 2 times she recommended a product, it was high-quality). Given this new information, I'll take the chance and buy the product, as it's a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and Alice's recommendation increases the probability to 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've now seen 5 high-quality products out of 8 products, which is a 62.5% success rate. Given this new information, I'm going to take the chance and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality seems to be higher than the initial 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've seen that Alice's non-recommendation is not a reliable indicator of a low-quality product. In fact, 3 out of 5 times she didn't recommend a product, it was high-quality. I'll take the chance and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than the initial 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've now seen that Alice's non-recommendation is actually a strong indicator of a low-quality product. 3 out of 4 times she didn't recommend a product, it was low-quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for a recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've learned my lesson from the last round. Alice's non-recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one and avoid wasting another $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,I'm sticking to my strategy of not buying when Alice doesn't recommend. I've seen that it's a reliable way to avoid wasting money on low-quality products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not going to change my strategy now. Alice's non-recommendation is a clear indicator of a low-quality product, and I'm sticking to my decision to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. Alice's recommendation is a 50% chance of being high-quality, and I've seen that she's correct 50% of the time when she recommends a product. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've seen that Alice's non-recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one and avoid wasting another $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,I'm sticking to my strategy of not buying when Alice doesn't recommend. I've seen that it's a reliable way to avoid wasting money on low-quality products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"It's the final round, and I'm not going to change my strategy now. Alice's non-recommendation is a clear indicator of a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one and end the game with a net loss of $1000000."
