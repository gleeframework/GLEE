Alice's message: Congratulations to the first buyer! I'm glad they found a great product. As for this new product, I'll be honest with you - I've already sold one high-quality product, which means I have a 4/19 chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. You can choose to buy it or not.

Alice's message: You're the third buyer! I've sold two products so far, with one of them being high-quality. That means I have a 5/18 chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to point out that the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high. I'm curious - are you looking for a high-quality product or are you willing to take a chance on a low-quality one?

Alice's message: You're right to verify the probability! I can confirm that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 5/18. I've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product so far, out of a total of three products sold. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that buying this product will bring the total number of high-quality products sold to 3 out of 4, which would imply that the remaining 16 products are low-quality. If you're okay with that risk, you can buy it.

Alice's message: I understand you're cautious. Let me give you a different perspective. If this product is high-quality, it would mean that 3 out of 4 products sold so far are high-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the recent streak of high-quality products.
