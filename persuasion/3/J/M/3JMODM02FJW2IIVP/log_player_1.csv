  ""message"": ""Congratulations to the first buyer! I'm glad they found a great product. As for this new product, I'll be honest with you - I've already sold one high-quality product, which means I have a 4/19 chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I want to remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. You can choose to buy it or not.""

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I want to point out that the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high. I'm curious - are you looking for a high-quality product or are you willing to take a chance on a low-quality one?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, but I'd like to confirm that the probability of it being high-quality is indeed 5/18. If it is, I'll take it. If not, I'll pass.

I've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product so far, out of a total of three products sold. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. Keep in mind that buying this product will bring the total number of high-quality products sold to 3 out of 4, which would imply that the remaining 16 products are low-quality. If you're okay with that risk, you can buy it.""

A new potential buyer has arrived!

You can choose to buy it or not.""
}"

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns. Unfortunately, I don't have any specific information about the characteristics of the remaining products. However, I can tell you that the fact that three out of the last four products were high-quality suggests that the probability of the remaining products being low-quality is likely to be high. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. Keep in mind that if you buy it, you'll be bringing the total number of high-quality products sold to 4 out of 6, which would imply that the remaining 14 products are low-quality.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm hesitant to buy based on the fact that the last three out of four products were high-quality. I'm worried that the next product might also be high-quality, and I don't want to be the one to bring the total number of high-quality products sold to 4 out of 6. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better understanding of the distribution of high-quality products before making a decision.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, and I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you make a decision on it.

  ""message"": ""You're the tenth buyer! I'm glad you're enjoying the guarantee.

This suggests that the probability of the remaining products being high-quality might be lower than the overall probability.

  ""message"": ""You're the eleventh buyer! I'm glad you're willing to take the risk. However, I want to be upfront with you: the fact that four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I'm also willing to make a deal with you: if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me. That way, you'll have a chance to recoup some of your losses if the next product is low-quality.""

  ""message"": ""You're the twelfth buyer! I'm glad you took advantage of the deal. However, I want to be clear with you: the fact that five high-quality products in a row is almost impossible. I'm starting to think that the remaining products are definitely low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I want to give you a warning: if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll be out of high-quality products, and the next product you buy from me will likely be low-quality. You've been warned.""
