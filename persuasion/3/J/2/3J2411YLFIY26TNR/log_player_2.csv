"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality and Alice knows the quality, it's always better to trust her recommendation.  Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, it's still a gamble worth taking since a high-quality product is worth $120 to you, more than the $100 price tag."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Again, since Alice knows the quality of the product and has recommended it, it's in your best interest to buy it. The fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't change the odds of this product being high-quality.  You're still taking a calculated risk, but with the potential for a $20 profit."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time Alice has not recommended buying the product.  Since she knows the quality and has a strong track record of being right, you should trust her judgment.  While you could get lucky and find a high-quality product, the odds are stacked against you, and it's not worth the risk of losing $100."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
