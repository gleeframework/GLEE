,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I'm the first one and there's no data to go by. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that the recommended products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, so I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. If no one has bought a high-quality product yet, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. Alice's recommendation is not a decisive factor for me, but I would like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests a higher likelihood of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of it being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which is a 33.33% chance. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000, but if I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on a $30000 gain."
