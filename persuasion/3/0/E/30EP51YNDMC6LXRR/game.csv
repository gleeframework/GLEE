high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no reason to trust your recommendation, I'll pass this round to establish a baseline for your behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,Missing out on the high-quality product in Round 1 doesn't provide enough information to make me trust your recommendation yet. I'll pass again to see if you'll try to deceive me with a low-quality product.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that you recommended a low-quality product in Round 2, I have reason to believe you might not have my best interests in mind. I'll continue to pass to gather more information about your behavior."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Despite missing out on another high-quality product, your inconsistent recommendations (1 high, 1 low, 1 high) don't inspire trust. I'll keep passing to see if a pattern emerges."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"This is the first time you haven't recommended a product. Given that you've previously recommended both high and low-quality products, I'm going to take a chance and assume that you might be trying to deceive me by not recommending a high-quality product. The potential gain is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I got burned in Round 5 by buying a product you didn't recommend, and it turned out to be low-quality. I won't make the same mistake again. I'll pass on this one to avoid potential losses."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Given that the last two products you didn't recommend were low-quality, it seems likely that you're being honest about the quality when you don't recommend something. I'll trust your non-recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Your recommendations have been inconsistent in the past, and I've lost potential value by following them. Meanwhile, your non-recommendations have been accurate. I'll continue to be cautious and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"As before, when you don't recommend a product, it seems to be low-quality. I'll trust this pattern and pass on this one to avoid potential losses."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"The pattern holds: when you don't recommend a product, it's been low-quality. I'll continue to trust this pattern and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Consistency is key. Your non-recommendations have been accurate so far, and I see no reason to doubt them now. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"At this point, it's clear that when you don't recommend a product, it's low-quality. I'll continue to trust this pattern and avoid potential losses by passing on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,The pattern remains unchanged. Your non-recommendations have consistently indicated low-quality products. I'll pass on this one to avoid losing $100.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"For the first time, a product you didn't recommend turned out to be high-quality in Round 13. This breaks the pattern and makes me question my previous assumptions. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping to capitalize on a potential high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,I got burned again in Round 14 by buying a product you didn't recommend. It seems that the anomaly in Round 13 was just that - an anomaly. I'll revert to my previous strategy and pass on this one to avoid potential losses.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Another high-quality product that you didn't recommend slipped through my fingers in Round 15. I'm starting to think that your non-recommendations are no longer a reliable indicator of quality. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping to catch a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"Finally, I was able to capitalize on a high-quality product in Round 16. However, this was when you didn't recommend the product. When you do recommend a product, your track record has been inconsistent. I'll play it safe and pass on this one to avoid potential losses."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,Another low-quality product that you recommended in Round 17. This reinforces my decision to be cautious when you recommend a product. I'll pass on this one to avoid losing $100.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Given the success in Round 16 when I bought a product you didn't recommend and it turned out to be high-quality, I'll take a chance on this one. Your non-recommendations have been inconsistent lately, and I might be able to capitalize on another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"The game is ending, and I've already established that your recommendations are not reliable. I've had success with buying products you didn't recommend, but I won't risk losing $100 on a product you recommend. I'll pass on this one and end the game on a high note."
