Alice's message: I've already sold one high-quality product to a buyer who took a risk. If you're willing to take the risk, you can get a high-quality product for $10000. However, if you'd like to play it safe, I can offer you a 'guarantee' - I'll sell you a product, and if it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund and sell you a high-quality product for the same price.

Alice's message: I've now sold four high-quality products in a row. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the probability of the pattern continuing is 0.8^4 = 0.4096, or approximately 41%. However, I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a relatively unlikely occurrence.

Alice's message: I've now sold five high-quality products in a row, which is an extremely unlikely occurrence. Given this streak, it's likely that the true probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 80%. In fact, the probability of the streak continuing is 0.8^5 = 0.32768, which is lower than the probability of the streak being a coincidence (0.2^5 = 0.00032). This suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely above 80%.
