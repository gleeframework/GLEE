This new product is the third one, and I'm excited to offer it to you for the same price as the previous two, $1000000.

Alice's message: I understand your interest in the probability of the product being high-quality. Given that I've sold two high-quality products out of a total of five products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40%. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000, and I want to emphasize that this is still a great opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product at a relatively low price. However, I also want to be transparent with you that the odds are now against it being high-quality, and you should consider that carefully before making a decision.

Alice's message: I understand that the probability of 40% may not be enough to convince you to take the risk. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is at play here. With each additional product I sell, the probability of the next one being high-quality will continue to increase. I've now sold three high-quality products out of a total of seven products, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 30% (3/10). I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000, and I think it's still a great opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product at a relatively low price.

However, I want to highlight that this is still a relatively low probability, and I understand if you're not convinced. But I'd like to offer you a different perspective: even if the product is low-quality, you'll only lose $1000000, which is a relatively small price to pay for the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000, and I think it's a good opportunity to take a calculated risk.
