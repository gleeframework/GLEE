,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to offer you a unique perspective: even though we've only sold one product so far, the fact that it was a low-quality item doesn't necessarily reflect the overall quality of our products.

Would you like to take a chance and experience the best of what we have to offer?",
