"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $0 to you, but I'm only asking for $10000. It's a risk-free chance to save $10000, but if you decline, the next product might be worth more.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your position, but think about it this way: you're essentially getting a chance to save $10000, and if you don't take it, you'll be out $10000. You can't lose anything by buying, but you can gain $10000. Would you like to reconsider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your point, but I still don't think it's a good idea to buy a product worth $0 to me, even if it means saving $10000. I'll wait for a product that has a chance to be worth $40000 to me.""}"

I'm not going to give you any hints about its quality, but I will say that the price remains the same: $10000. You've already demonstrated your willingness to take a chance on a product that turned out to be high-quality. Are you willing to take another chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've learned my lesson! I've spent $20,000 on two products that turned out to be worthless, and I'm not willing to risk another $10,000 on a product with an unknown quality.
