"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational seller, you should never recommend a low-quality product.  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and you have no way to convince them otherwise in the first round. Recommending a low-quality product will likely result in the buyer not purchasing and potentially lowering your future sales."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 1. You have no way to convince the buyer that this low-quality product is worth $100.  Since they know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's still in their best interest to pass.  Continuing to recommend low-quality products will only hurt your credibility and future sales."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the time to change your strategy!  You have a high-quality product, and even though the buyer has no prior information about you, you can make a strong case:

* **The odds are in your favor:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality. This is a good starting point for persuasion.
* **No risk, all reward:** Since you're recommending the product, you're signaling confidence in its quality. The buyer can  trust that you wouldn't recommend something that you don't believe is worth the price. This takes away some of the risk for the buyer.

You could even add a message to the buyer like: 

""This round's product is truly exceptional!  I highly recommend you consider it. You won't be disappointed!"""
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and no products have been sold yet to influence my decision otherwise.
