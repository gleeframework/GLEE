,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Based on the statistics, I'm guessing it's 100% because no high-quality products have been sold. If that's correct, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Can you provide more information about the products you've sold so far, such as the proportion of high-quality products you've had in your inventory?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products may be biased towards being low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
