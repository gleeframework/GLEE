Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know this product is low-quality. Since you have no information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products, there's no way to know if the $10,000 price is a good deal for him.  It's best to recommend against buying this product to avoid potentially making a bad deal."
