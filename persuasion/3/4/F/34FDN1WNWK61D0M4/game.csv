,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation! I appreciate your willingness to learn more about my products. As a matter of fact, I've now sold 2 out of 2 products, and 0 of them have been high-quality. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible experience. This product is still available for $100, and I believe it's a great opportunity to get a head start. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to make sure you understand that I'm doing this more out of curiosity about the game than the product itself.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the process! I can assure you that my selection process is truly random. I don't have any control over which product I offer to each buyer, and I don't use any factors other than chance to determine which product to offer.

,,the buyer,4,"I'm not sure I'm convinced that the product is high-quality. Given that 4 out of 4 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is actually lower than 33.33%. Can you tell me more about your sales record and how it might be influencing my decision?",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism! I can assure you that my sales record is just a coincidence, and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is still 33.33%.

,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is 33.33%.

What do you think?",
,,the buyer,13,"Based on the sales record, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25%, which is lower than the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality.
