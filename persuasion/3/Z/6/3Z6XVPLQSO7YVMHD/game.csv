It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to make a deal like this. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible opportunity?",

,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're a smart businessman, and you know a good deal when you see one. I respect that. But let me ask you, have you ever had to deal with a product that didn't quite live up to its promise? One that had some... hidden costs or limitations?
