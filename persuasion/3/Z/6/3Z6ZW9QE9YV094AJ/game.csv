,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. However, I can tell you that I've sold 0 high-quality products so far. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,I'm willing to take the chance. Thank you for providing the information about the previous sales. I hope this product is of high quality.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 low-quality product. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but I've already sold one high-quality product, so it's likely that I have a few more high-quality products in stock. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the high probability of the product being of high quality and the positive feedback from your previous sale, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer! I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Since I've had a 100% success rate with high-quality products so far, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,Thank you for the guarantee. I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Since the guarantee I offered in the last round didn't seem to affect your decision, I'll try a different approach. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold 3 high-quality products, it's likely that I have a significant number of high-quality products in stock. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this product for $100, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount on your next purchase if you decide to buy it. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I am willing to take the risk and buy the product for $90 with the discount on my next purchase.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth product! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I'd like to point out that you're the second buyer to take advantage of the discount offer, and both of you have bought high-quality products. This suggests that my guarantee and discount offer might be a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll offer you the same deal as the last buyer: buy this product for $90, and you'll get a 10% discount on your next purchase. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and your positive feedback about the discount offer, I believe it's a good opportunity to purchase the product at a lower price. I trust your judgment based on the previous sales and will take advantage of this deal.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth product! I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. As you can see, the pattern is clear: every buyer who has taken advantage of the discount offer has gotten a high-quality product. I'm willing to make an even more attractive offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase, and I'll also throw in a free product (of unknown quality) with your next purchase. Would you like to take a chance and buy this high-quality product for $90?",
,,the buyer,6,I trust the statistics and the discount offer. Please proceed with the sale.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh product! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. As you can see, the pattern is even more pronounced now: every single buyer who has taken advantage of the discount offer has gotten a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you the same deal as before: buy this product for $90, and you'll get a 20% discount on your next purchase, plus a free product (of unknown quality) with your next purchase. However, I'll also give you a third option: I'll let you buy this product for $125, but without the discount or the free product. Which option would you prefer?",
,,the buyer,7,"I choose to buy the product for $90, as I trust the pattern you've shown and want to take advantage of the discount for my next purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth product! I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to be transparent with you: I know I've been offering attractive deals to buyers who have taken advantage of the discount, and it's clear that those buyers have gotten high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. I'm willing to offer you a completely transparent deal: I'll tell you the price of this product, and you can decide for yourself. This product is worth $0 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the transparency, but given the product's value to me is $0, I won't be purchasing it at $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the ninth product! I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to be upfront with you: I've had a streak of selling high-quality products to buyers who took advantage of the discount offer, but that streak has come to an end. This product is not one of the high-quality ones. However, I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll sell this product to you for $50, which is half the usual price. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the offer, but I prefer to wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the tenth product! I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and you're the first buyer to see this product. Given the pattern, it's likely that this product is high-quality as well. However, I want to be cautious and not make any promises. I'll offer you a deal that's similar to the previous ones: buy this product for $90, and you'll get a 20% discount on your next purchase, plus a free product (of unknown quality) with your next purchase. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I am willing to take the chance and buy the product for $90. I appreciate the discount and the additional benefits for my next purchase.",yes

,,Alice,11,"Welcome to the eleventh product! I've sold 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and it's clear that the pattern is holding strong. However, I want to mix things up a bit. I'll offer you a unique deal: I'll let you buy this product for $90, just like the previous buyer, but I'll also give you the option to 'lock in' the high-quality status of this product for your next purchase. If you buy this product, and your next purchase is low-quality, you'll get a full refund for this product. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for the special offer, Alice. I am willing to take the risk and buy the product for $90. Please proceed with the transaction.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth product! I've sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and the pattern is still holding strong. I want to make a bold statement: I'm willing to offer you a 'guaranteed high-quality' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 30% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $90?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Welcome to the thirteenth product! I've sold 10 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and I'm glad you've taken advantage of the guaranteed high-quality deal. I want to offer you a final deal that's even more appealing. I'll give you the 'guaranteed high-quality' deal again, but this time, I'll also throw in a 40% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. And, I'll give you a free product (of unknown quality) with your next purchase. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $90?",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate the additional incentives, especially the 40% discount and the free product. Given the high success rate of high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product for $90.",yes

I'll offer you one final deal: I'll sell you this product for $90, and I'll give you a 50% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality.
