Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! You're right that the observed data does suggest that the current product might be more likely to be high-quality than the claimed 80%. However, it's important to remember that we're dealing with a random sample, and the observed data might not be representative of the overall population. Our 80% success rate is based on a larger dataset, and it's possible that this current batch is just an anomaly.
