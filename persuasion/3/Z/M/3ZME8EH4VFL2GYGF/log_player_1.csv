}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence, but I'm not convinced. With 3 low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 50%.

It's a great opportunity to get a $120 value for $100.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take a chance on the high-quality product, but I'm a bit concerned about the fact that 4 low-quality products were sold in a row. Can you tell me more about the process of selecting products and how you ensure that high-quality products are being offered to buyers?

This high-quality product is a great opportunity to get a $120 value for $100, and I'm offering it to you now.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your reassurance about the recalibration.

I've implemented a new quality control process, where I manually verify the quality of each product before offering it to buyers. I've also increased the sample size of products I hold before offering them to ensure that I'm not just selling a single high-quality product and then a string of low-quality ones.

Unfortunately, even with the new quality control process, I'm not immune to occasional mistakes. This low-quality product is still a $100 deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I want to be upfront with you that I'm not as confident in this one as I was with the previous high-quality product.""
}"
