Alice's message: Greetings! I understand your hesitation given the current lack of sales records. However, please consider that while we haven't had any sales yet, each product has an equal chance of being either high- or low-quality. With a low-quality item priced at $100, it might still offer value if you're looking for a budget option. Rest assured, all purchases are final and non-refundable, so make sure to weigh your options carefully.
