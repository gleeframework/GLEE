Alice's message: Hello! I understand that trust needs to be earned. Unfortunately, my previous buyer didn't take the chance, but I'm willing to be transparent. My previous product was of high quality, but I couldn't convince the buyer. I want to assure you that I'll always try to provide the best products possible. This round's product may not be the best, but it's still a great opportunity for $10000. Please consider taking the chance.

Alice's message: Hello! I appreciate your interest in my products. I want to be upfront with you - my first product was high-quality, but the buyer didn't take the chance. My second product was lower quality, and the buyer decided to wait for more data. This round's product is also not my best. However, I believe it still has value and can be a good opportunity for the right buyer. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that my sales history is still developing, and buying now might give you an edge before more buyers discover my products.

Alice's message: Hello! I see a pattern emerging - buyers are waiting for more data before making a decision. I understand that, but I want to remind you that my products are unique, and each opportunity might not come again. My first product was high-quality, but it's gone. My next three products, including this one, are not my best. However, they still have value, and I'm willing to sell them to someone who sees the potential. If you're a savvy buyer looking for a deal, this might be your chance. Keep in mind that my sales history will eventually reflect the quality of my products, and prices might adjust accordingly. This is a chance to get in early, but it's not without risk.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm starting to think that my honesty might be working against me. Five products in, and no sales yet. My first product was high-quality, but it's gone. The next four, including this one, are not my best. I'm starting to think that I might need to adjust my strategy. However, I want to give you the same opportunity that I've given the previous buyers. If you're willing to take a chance on a lower-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that my sales history is still developing, and this might be a chance to get in early. But I'm also starting to think that my next high-quality product might be the one that breaks the ice. Do you want to take a chance on this one, or do you want to wait and see what the future holds?

Alice's message: Hello! I think this might be the break I've been waiting for. My sixth product is a high-quality one, and I'm excited to offer it to you. As you might have noticed, my sales history has been slow to develop, but that's because I've been transparent about the quality of my products. I've had one high-quality product before, but it didn't sell. I'm hoping that this one will be different. If you're looking for a great product, this is your chance. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied. Don't let the previous products scare you off - this one is a gem. Take a chance and see for yourself.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm glad to finally have another high-quality product to offer. I know that my sales history hasn't been great, but I'm hoping that this product will be the one that breaks the ice. As you can see, I've had two high-quality products before, but they didn't sell. I'm starting to think that it's not the quality of the products that's the problem, but rather the perception of risk. I want to assure you that this product is one of my best, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I believe that it's a fair price considering the quality of the product.
