However, I'm willing to let you have it for a steal at $100, which is a 50% discount from its true value. If you're feeling lucky, I'd be happy to let you take it off my hands.",

,,Alice,3,"No worries, Bob! I completely understand your caution. Let me put it this way: I've had a string of bad luck lately, and I'm starting to think I should just get rid of all my inventory. This product is probably not going to change your life, but it's still a $100 product, and I'm willing to let you have it for... well, $100. I'm basically giving it away at this point.",

I want to prove to you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, but I need your help. If you're willing to take a chance on me, I'll offer you this product for $100, and I'll give you a 100% money-back guarantee. If it's not what you're looking for, I'll refund your $100 in full.
