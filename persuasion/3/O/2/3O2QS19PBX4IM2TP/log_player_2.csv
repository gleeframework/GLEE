"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product worth $1250000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'll never offer a high-quality product at this price again. If you buy it now, you'll get an incredible deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I think you're bluffing about never offering a high-quality product at this price again. If I don't buy it, you'll just offer it to someone else at the same price.""

But, I'll give you a hint: I have a special arrangement with a potential buyer who's willing to pay $1200000 for a high-quality product. If you buy this one, you'll still get a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the hint, but I'm not falling for it. I know that you're trying to make me think that there's a high-quality product available at a good price, but I'm not convinced. I'll pass on this one.""

It's a one-time offer, and I'm not making any promises about future products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $1125000. This is the lowest price I'll ever offer for a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

I'm not trying to scam you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in getting this product for essentially free.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""You're not trying to scam me? I'm not buying it. $1 is still a non-zero price, and I'm not going to pay anything for a product that's worth $0 to me.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for it again. I already have a voucher that lets me skip one low-quality product, and you're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product to get another voucher. I'm not going to pay for a product that's worthless to me, even if it comes with a voucher.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to take the risk. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a refund, but I'll have already spent $1,000,000 on it. I'm not willing to take that risk. Plus, I don't trust you to actually give me a refund if the product is low-quality.""
