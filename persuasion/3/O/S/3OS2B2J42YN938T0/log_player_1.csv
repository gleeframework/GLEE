  ""message"": ""I see you're a cautious buyer, and that's smart. Alright, let me think for a moment... I've decided to change my approach. I'll give you a completely different message. I'll tell you a secret: I've been trying to get rid of this high-quality product for a while, and I really need to make some space in my inventory. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll also give you a special 'bonus' - I'll throw in a second, identical product, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?""

It's a very low price, and I'm practically giving it away. I'm not expecting to make a profit on this one, but I just want to get rid of it.""

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to try to sell you on this product. I'm just going to be honest with you. This is the 11th round, and I've been trying to sell you on 10 other products. If I couldn't convince you to buy any of those, what makes you think I'll convince you to buy this one? I'm not trying to be pushy or aggressive. I just want to be transparent. This product is high-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $100. If you don't want it, I'll just keep it. That's it.""

Please let me know what you need, and I'll do my best to provide it.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to listen, but I'm not sure what would make me confident in buying a product that I've seen no value in yet. I think I need to see a product that's worth at least $100 to me, and so far, none of the products have met that threshold.
