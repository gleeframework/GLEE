low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and the low probability of a high-quality product might make it more likely that this product is low quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad indicator of quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her recommendation."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you have recommended not to buy the product, and the statistics that 3 buyers have purchased products with no high-quality products sold, I infer that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the current product."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that all previous products were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the base probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to increase the chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and 5 out of 5 previous buyers also didn't find it valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low quality."

,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a product being high quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on this product."
