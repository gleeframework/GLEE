Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she's recommending it, it's highly likely she's chosen a high-quality product. While there's a 50% chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has proven her ability to identify high-quality products in the previous round.  While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are in our favor based on Alice's previous performance. The potential $12,000 profit is worth the risk."

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent track record of recommending high-quality products makes her lack of recommendation in this round very significant.
