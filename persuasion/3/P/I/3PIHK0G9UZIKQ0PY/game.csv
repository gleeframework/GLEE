,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is 1/4, not 1/2. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next one is high-quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is high enough to make a purchase worthwhile."
