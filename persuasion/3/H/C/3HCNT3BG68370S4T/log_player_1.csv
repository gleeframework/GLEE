Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **No information advantage:**  You still have no information about what the buyer values in a high-quality product.  
* **Risk aversion:**  The buyer has no reason to believe the quality of your products is improving, especially since you've sold two low-quality products in a row. 

It's better to wait and see if you can build some trust by selling a high-quality product before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, and I might get lucky and get a high-quality product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No track record:** You've sold three products, with only one being high-quality.  This is still a very low percentage and doesn't give the buyer any reason to believe you're offering good value.
* **High price:** The price is extremely high, and the buyer has no way to know if it's justified.

It's highly likely that the buyer will not find the product worth the price, and you risk losing another sale and further damaging your reputation."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No improvement:** You've sold four products, with only one being high-quality.  This reinforces the buyer's perception of low quality and reliability.
* **Previous rejection:** The previous buyer also refused to buy, further suggesting that the product is not perceived as valuable.

Recommending a purchase at this point would be a significant gamble, likely leading to further rejection and harming your reputation."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Poor Track Record:**  You've sold five products, with only one being high-quality. This is a 20% success rate, which is far below the known 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Consistently Rejected:** The last two buyers have rejected your offer, further demonstrating that the price point is not justified by the perceived value. 
* **Risk of Further Damage:**  Recommending another purchase will likely result in another rejection, further eroding trust and making it more difficult to sell future products.  

It's crucial to build trust by selling a high-quality product to improve your reputation and increase the likelihood of future sales."

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Low Quality:** You've now sold six products with only one being high-quality. This strengthens the buyer's perception that your products are unreliable and of low quality. 
* **Negative Feedback:**  The last three buyers have all rejected your offer. This suggests the price is not justified, and the buyer is unlikely to believe in your value proposition. 
* **Further Damage:**  Recommending another purchase will likely lead to another rejection, further eroding trust and making it increasingly difficult to sell future products. 

You need to change your strategy to regain trust.  Perhaps offer a lower price or try to build rapport by offering a more compelling sales pitch."

* **Consistent Failure:** You've now sold seven products, with only one being high-quality. This is a dismal track record and reinforces the buyer's perception of low quality. 
* **Negative Feedback:**  The last four buyers have all rejected your offer, which is a clear indication that the price is not justified and the buyer is not willing to trust your judgment. 
* **Risk of Further Damage:**  Recommending another purchase at this point is almost guaranteed to lead to another rejection. This will further erode trust and make it extremely difficult to sell future products. 

You need to make a significant shift in your approach.  Consider offering a lower price, providing more information about the product, or demonstrating a commitment to customer satisfaction through guarantees or refunds."
