high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the first product before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping that the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by their own risk assessment, which might have been different from mine."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that all previous products were low-quality. If that's the case, then the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is not high enough to justify a purchase at $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's because of the statistics or Alice's recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think I should buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Given your previous recommendations, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you've been offering. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the sales record."

,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the products Alice is offering are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice that is based on a more balanced sample size."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the overall proportion of low-quality products in the previous 6 sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. If not, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is recommending me to pass, I'll take that as a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on the product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
