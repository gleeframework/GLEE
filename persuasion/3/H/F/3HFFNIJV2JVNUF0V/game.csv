low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current 0/2 ratio suggests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the low recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping the probability of it being high quality is higher than 50% based on the current statistics."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have bought the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 50% chance of low-quality products, it's reasonable to assume that the product might not be worth the $100 price tag. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to take the risk with Alice's recommendation against it. I'd like to know the outcome of the previous sales to better inform my decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced to buy it based on your past recommendations, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given the sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. However, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I get the total number of products offered and the total number of buyers who have passed on the product?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous sales record. If 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics."
