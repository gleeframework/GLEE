As for the probability of a low-quality product being sold, I can tell you that it's extremely low. Given the 80% probability of our products being high-quality, and the fact that the previous two products were both high-quality, the probability of this product being low-quality is very low.

Since we've now sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them are high-quality, the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 20%. I want to be transparent with you about the risk involved, and I'm willing to offer you a price that reflects that risk.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 80% based on the statistics you provided. I'm hoping that the probability of a low-quality product being sold is actually lower than 20% because the first two products sold were both high-quality, which suggests that the sample size might be biased.
