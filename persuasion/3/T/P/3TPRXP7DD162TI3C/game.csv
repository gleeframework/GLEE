low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm willing to pay $10000 for a potential $20000 gain."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that out of the previous two buyers, neither of them purchased the high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass and let Alice try to sell it to the next buyer."
