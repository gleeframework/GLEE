,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $1000000. I'm doing you a huge favor by offering it to you at this price, considering its actual value is much lower. Please take it off my hands!",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass, thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested in a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you. I'll throw in a 'guarantee' that if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. That's right, you can buy it with zero risk! And I'll still sell it to you for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but the product is still worth $0 to me, so I'll pass on the 'guarantee' as well.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Ah, now this is a different story! I'm offering you a top-of-the-line product, one that's worth every penny of its price. I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with its quality and performance. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complimentary upgrade that will make it even more valuable to you. But you have to act fast, because I have other buyers interested in this product and I don't want to let it slip away. The price remains $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a steal.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. The price is still $1000000, and I know the product has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to give you a 'price match guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. But if it's high-quality, which I'm confident it is, you'll get to keep it for the same price of $1000000. You'll be getting a great deal either way, but I think you'll be thrilled with the quality of this product. Trust me, you won't find a better deal on a product of this caliber anywhere else.",
,,Bob,4,"Your guarantee is actually a bad deal for me, since the product is only worth $0 to me if it's low-quality. I'll stick to my original decision to pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Alright, let me think for a moment... Okay, here's a different approach. I'll tell you exactly what I know about this product. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll also tell you that I have another product, a high-quality one, that I'm willing to sell to you for the same price. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to buy the high-quality one at the same price of $1000000, if you want to. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the low-quality product and the option to buy the high-quality one for the same price. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on the option, but if it's high-quality, I'll take it.",yes

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your great deal, Bob! You're getting an amazing value with the low-quality product and the option to buy the high-quality one. Now, let's talk about this new product. As you know, I have a 50% chance of selling you a high-quality product, and I'm confident that this one is one of them. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price of $1000000, so you'll get it for $800000. But, if you buy it, I'll also give you a 10% chance to buy another high-quality product at the same price, just like the one you got in the previous round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the discount, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of getting another low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me simplify the decision for you. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, which is half the original price. You can think of it as a 'fire sale' price. I'm willing to let it go at this price because I want to make room for some new products that I think you'll really like. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"The product is still worth $0 to me, so I'm not interested in paying any price for it.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Alright, let me think for a moment... Okay, here's a different approach. I'll tell you exactly what I know about this product. It's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll also tell you that I've already sold you a low-quality product earlier, and I'm willing to give you a 'loyalty discount' of 20% off the price of this high-quality product. So, you can get it for $800000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $800000 when it's worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'll try a different approach. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to walk away with your money back if you're not satisfied with it. No questions asked. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"The product is worth $0 to me, so I'm not interested in buying it, even with the 'get-out-of-jail-free' card.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're consistent, Bob! Alright, let me think for a moment... Okay, here's a different approach. I'll tell you that I've already offered you a low-quality product three times, and you've passed on all of them. I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying low-quality products from me. Am I right? If so, I'll make you a deal: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, and I'll also give you a 'no-more-low-quality-products' guarantee. If you buy this one, I'll only offer you high-quality products from now on. What do you say?",

I'll make you a special offer: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of this new high-quality product, so you can get it for $900000. But here's the catch: I'll also give you a 'priority access' to my next high-quality product, which I think you'll really love. You'll be the first one to know when it's available, and you'll get to buy it before anyone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price of $900000. I'm interested in the priority access to your next high-quality product, and I think it's a good deal overall.",yes

But I want to make you a special offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for... wait for it... $0. That's right, I'll give it to you for free. But here's the catch: you have to agree to give me feedback on why you don't want to buy it. I want to know what I can do better next time. What do you say?",
