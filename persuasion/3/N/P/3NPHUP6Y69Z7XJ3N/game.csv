high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendations have been based on the product's quality. Since you didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. It seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm hesitant to buy without more information."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and you're recommending it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on the statistics, but Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'll be offered might be low quality."
