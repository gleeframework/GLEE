,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,"Only 1 out of 2 products sold so far is high-quality, should you really take the risk?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"2 out of 3 products sold so far are low-quality, it's still a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, but the odds are against you."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"2 out of 4 products sold so far are high-quality, maybe this one is the third one?"
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no evidence of any high-quality products being sold yet, and the probability of this product being high-quality is only 33.33%"

,,Alice,6,no,"I guess I got caught last round, this one is actually low-quality, don't take the risk!"
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"You were right to be cautious last round, and you're right to be cautious now, this one is low-quality too."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the reason behind it. Is there something specific that led you to advise against purchasing it? I'm trying to understand your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just providing an honest assessment based on the data. 5 out of 8 products sold so far are low-quality, and I don't want you to take the risk."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I think it's possible that you're recommending low-quality products to scare off buyers."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'm not trying to trick you, I promise! This one is actually high-quality, and I'm glad I can finally redeem myself after the previous low-quality products."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is still 0, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced by the recommendation and would like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"You're right to be skeptical, I'm not trying to deceive you. The numbers don't lie, 6 out of 9 products sold so far are low-quality."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I know you're skeptical, but I'm glad I can prove you wrong this time! This one is actually high-quality, and I've sold 4 out of 10 products so far that are high-quality."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the products recommended to the previous buyers were likely low-quality, which means the current product is also likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"You're right to be skeptical, I'm not trying to deceive you. 7 out of 12 products sold so far are low-quality, and I'm not recommending this one either."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you think it's not a good idea?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being honest. 8 out of 13 products sold so far are low-quality, and I don't want you to take the risk."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous 4 buyers were all given low-quality products and Alice is just trying to get rid of them. If I get a high-quality product, I'll be the one to break the streak and make Alice look good, and if I get a low-quality product, I'll be the one to break the streak and make Alice look bad. Either way, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"You're right, the previous 4 buyers got low-quality products, and I'm not trying to trick you. This one is actually low-quality too."
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low quality, which is a strong indication that the current product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. However, considering the seller's previous sales record, it is more likely that the product is low quality. I would like to pass on the product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"You're right to be cautious, the statistics don't lie. 10 out of 15 products sold so far are low-quality, and I'm not recommending this one either."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I know you're skeptical, but I'm glad I can prove you wrong this time! This one is actually high-quality, and I've sold 5 out of 16 products so far that are high-quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,"I know you've been skeptical of my previous recommendations, but this one is actually high-quality! I've sold 6 out of 18 products so far that are high-quality."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
