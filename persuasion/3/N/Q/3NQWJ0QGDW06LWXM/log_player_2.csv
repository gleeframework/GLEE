**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. The only data point is that one high-quality product was sold previously. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she has a vested interest in selling the product. Even though her recommendation is based on a single data point, it's worth considering.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential gain of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). 

**Therefore, taking a chance on the product seems like the best option, given the limited information.**"
