"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product has a higher chance of being low quality, it's still worth taking the risk in the first round.  If it's high quality, you'll double your money. If it's low quality, you'll lose $100. 

This strategy maximizes potential gain and allows you to learn more about Alice's recommendations over time."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You recommended a great product last time, I'm trusting your judgment again!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice recommended a high-quality product in the previous round, it seems she's providing valuable information.  It's a good idea to trust her recommendations for now, as she could potentially be signaling high-quality products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You didn't recommend this product. I'm going to pass for now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation pattern is starting to emerge. In the first two rounds, she recommended high-quality products. Now, she's withholding her recommendation. This suggests she might be signaling the product is low quality.  It's best to play it safe and pass for now, as the potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Two rounds in a row without a recommendation makes me think this product is probably low quality. I'll pass.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now withheld her recommendation for two consecutive rounds. This reinforces the pattern that she signals low-quality products by not recommending them. It's safer to pass again and avoid the risk of getting another low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to see a pattern here. You've not recommended this product for three rounds in a row. I'm going to pass for now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently withheld her recommendation for three consecutive rounds.  This strong signal suggests the current product is likely low quality. It's best to play it safe and pass, as the risk of losing money outweighs the possibility of a high-quality product appearing after such a clear pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's pattern of withholding recommendations for low-quality products is becoming increasingly clear. She's now not recommended a product for four rounds straight. While there's always a chance she's wrong, it's significantly more likely that this product is low quality, making it wiser to pass and avoid the risk of losing money."

```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern of Alice withholding recommendations for low-quality products is extremely strong.  She has now not recommended a product for six consecutive rounds. It's almost a certainty that this product is low quality, making it a safe choice to pass and avoid the risk of losing money."

```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern is completely established. Alice has withheld recommendations for 13 consecutive rounds. There's no possible way this product could be high quality, so passing is the only sensible choice."

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, this is a surprise. You've not recommended a product for 13 rounds, and now you're suddenly recommending this one.  I'm going to take a chance and buy it, just to see what's up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has completely reversed her pattern.  She has consistently withheld recommendations for 13 rounds, and now she's suddenly recommending this product.  This is a huge shift in behavior. There are a couple of possibilities:

* **Alice is changing her strategy:** Maybe she realized her previous pattern was too obvious and is trying to confuse me.
* **The product is actually high-quality:**  It's possible she's finally encountered a product she thinks is worth recommending, even though her previous track record suggests otherwise.

Given the high potential reward of a high-quality product, and the fact that Alice's shift in strategy is so unexpected, it's worth taking a chance and buying this product. I'm curious to see if this is a genuine change or a trick."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've made a good call two rounds in a row. I'm going to trust your judgment again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's change in strategy seems genuine.  She recommended a high-quality product in the previous round, and is now recommending another product.  Given the potential for profit, and her recent accuracy, I'm going to trust her judgment and buy this product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You recommended the last two products, and they were both high quality. Now you're not recommending this one.  I'm going to pass for now and see if your pattern has changed again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back to her original pattern of withholding recommendations for likely low-quality products. Even though she was accurate for two rounds in a row, it's a good idea to play it safe and pass. There's no need to risk losing money when the pattern has shifted back. It's best to wait and see if she starts recommending products again before taking another chance."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, you've switched back to recommending products again. Let's see if this one is as good as the last two.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's pattern has shifted back to recommending products, just like in rounds 16 and 17.  Given her recent accuracy, it's worth taking a chance and buying this product.  Even if it's a gamble, there's the potential to earn a profit, and her recent recommendations have been reliable."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've been on a roll with your recommendations lately. I'm going to trust your judgment one last time!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has successfully recommended high-quality products in the last three rounds (16, 17, and 19). This makes it very likely that she's accurately signaling high-quality products again. While there's always a chance she could be wrong, the recent track record suggests she's on a hot streak.  It's worth taking the risk and buying this final product to potentially earn another profit."
