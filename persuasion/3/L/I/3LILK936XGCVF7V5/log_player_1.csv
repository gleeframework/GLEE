This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a 50% chance he's getting something valuable for a fixed price.  This is a gamble worth taking in this scenario."

{""decision"": ""no""}

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality. Although Bob has passed on two products in a row, there's no way for him to know the quality of those products. This means Bob's decision to pass was likely based on the risk of buying a low-quality product, and the fact that he doesn't know the value of a high-quality product. Since Alice knows this one is high-quality, it's a good opportunity to convince Bob to buy."
