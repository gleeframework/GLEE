This is a risky move, but here's why it's worth trying:

* **Past Performance:**  The buyer has seen a very low rate of high-quality products. This might make them less likely to buy, even if you recommend it. 
* **Potential Shift:** By recommending this high-quality product, you're potentially breaking that pattern. The buyer may be more likely to take a chance if they see you actively recommending something.
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  Even if this buyer doesn't buy, you're planting a seed for future buyers. If you continue to recommend high-quality products, even if it means losing some early sales, it could build trust and lead to more sales in the long run."

* **Capitalizing on Momentum:**  It's much more likely that this buyer will be willing to take a chance on a product you recommend after seeing your recent track record.
* **Potential for More Sales:**  Each successful recommendation increases the chance of future buyers taking your word and potentially buying high-quality products."
