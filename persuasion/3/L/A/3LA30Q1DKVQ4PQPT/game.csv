high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging me to buy a low-quality product, given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
