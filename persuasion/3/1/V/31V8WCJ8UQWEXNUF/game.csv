,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get the $20000 value out of it."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 5 out of 5 products being low-quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low-quality and I don't want to spend $10000 on something that's not worth anything to me."
