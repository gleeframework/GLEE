,,Alice,2,"Welcome! As the seller, I want to provide transparency about my selling record. So far, I've had 1 high-quality product out of 1 product offered. However, I must inform you that the current product may or may not be of the same quality. I assure you that the price of $10000 is fixed and non-negotiable.

Out of the 3 products offered so far, 2 have been high-quality, but only 1 of them was actually sold as such - the other high-quality product wasn't purchased. The product that was sold in Round 2 turned out to be low-quality. I'll let you decide whether to take a chance on the current product at the fixed price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, not just the number of high-quality products offered.",no

However, only 1 high-quality product has been sold, and 1 low-quality product has been sold. This means that the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 1 out of 2, or 50%. I'll let you make your own decision about the current product, which is available for $10000.",

However, only 1 high-quality product has been sold, and 2 low-quality products have been sold. This means that the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is still 1 out of 3, or approximately 33.33%. I want to assure you that the current product is of the highest quality, but I'll let you make your own decision. It's available for $10000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 33.33%. I'm not relying on your assurance that the current product is of the highest quality.",yes

A total of 2 high-quality products have been sold, and 2 low-quality products have been sold. This means that the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is now 2 out of 4, or 50%. I'll let you make your own decision about the current product, which is available for $10000.",
