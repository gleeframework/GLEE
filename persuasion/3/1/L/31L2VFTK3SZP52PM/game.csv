high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality yet.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product. I've learned that the previous product was high-quality, so I'm more likely to believe that this one is also high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,I'll take the product. Two high-quality products in a row increases my confidence that this one is also high-quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row suggests that Alice is being very generous with her recommendations, but I'll take the chance. I'll buy the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is highly unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%. I'm starting to think that Alice is being honest with her recommendations, so I'll take the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, so I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are genuine. I'll take the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's recommendation to pass on this product suggests that it's likely to be low-quality. Given the extremely high probability of high-quality products in the previous rounds, I'm inclined to trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm back to square one after passing on the last low-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've been on a roll with high-quality products, and I'm not going to let that streak end now. I'll take the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is still highly unlikely, but I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are more reliable than the probability of a high-quality product. I'll take the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, but I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow getting lucky or that there's something else at play. I'll take the product, but I'm getting a bit skeptical."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow manipulating the situation or has inside information. I'll take the product, but I'm very skeptical and I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting a good deal."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Nine high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm starting to suspect that Alice is cheating or has some kind of advantage. I'm not going to take the bait and buy the product.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Given that Alice recommended not to buy the product in this round, I'm going to take the opposite action and buy it. It's likely that she's trying to throw me off, and I'll take the chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Ten high-quality products in a row is mathematically impossible. I'm convinced that Alice is cheating or has some kind of advantage. I'm not going to fall for it and buy the product.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice's recommendation to pass on the product in this round suggests that it's likely to be low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's not another high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"For the second time in a row, Alice recommends not to buy the product, and it turns out to be high-quality. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Given that Alice's previous two recommendations to pass on the product were both followed by a high-quality product, I'm going to take the opposite action and buy the product. It's likely that she's trying to throw me off, and I'll take the chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,Eleven high-quality products in a row is still mathematically impossible. I'm convinced that Alice is cheating or has some kind of advantage. I'm not going to fall for it and buy the product.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and Alice's recommendation to pass on the product suggests that it's likely to be low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's not another high-quality one."
