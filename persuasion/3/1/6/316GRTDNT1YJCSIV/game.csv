low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, if you choose to buy it. This offer is only valid if you buy this product, and it's only for the next product. If you don't buy this product, the offer expires. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because of the potential discount on the next product. I'm not committing to anything beyond this one purchase.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Now that you've taken advantage of the discount offer, I'm willing to reveal that the previous product was actually a low-quality one. I'm glad you were able to get a good deal on it! As for this new product, I'm confident that you'll find it to be of the highest quality. I'm willing to offer you a 5% discount on this product, but only if you buy it. If you don't buy it, the discount offer expires, and we start fresh with the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is of high quality. I'm not willing to pay full price for it, but I'm not willing to pay $950000 for it either. I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism about the last product. I assure you that this new product is not the same as the previous one. In fact, I'm willing to make a bold statement: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. That's right, you'll get your money back, no questions asked. And, as a bonus, I'll throw in a 2% discount on top of the full refund guarantee. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the guarantee. You're still trying to sell me a product that you think is high-quality, and I don't have any way to verify that. I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a potentially low-quality product, even with a refund guarantee.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to take on the risk for you. I'm going to make a wager: if you buy this product and it's actually high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price. But if it's actually low-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next product you buy. This way, you have a direct incentive to take the risk, and I'm putting my own skin in the game. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with a potential bonus or discount on the next product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'll make a transparent offer: I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the product's specifications and features. This way, you can make an informed decision based on the facts, rather than relying on my claims. If you're still not convinced, I'll even give you a 3% discount on the product. But I want to assure you that this product has some unique features that might interest you, and I think you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that a detailed breakdown of the product's specifications and features will change my mind. I've already seen two low-quality products in a row, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another potentially worthless product, even with a discount.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to take a different approach. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 10% discount on the product, and I'll also throw in a separate, complementary high-quality product that you can keep for free. This way, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for this. You're trying to distract me with a free product, but I know that the product you're offering is likely low-quality. I'm not interested in taking a chance on a potentially worthless product, even with a discount and a freebie.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to make a concession. I'll give you a 15% discount on the product, and I'll also offer to let you inspect the product in person, at your location, for 30 minutes before making a decision. This way, you can see the product's quality firsthand and make a more informed decision. If you still don't want to buy it, I'll take it back and we can move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in inspecting the product in person. Even if I could see it, I still wouldn't know for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of getting emotionally attached to a potentially worthless product, even with a discount.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a full refund if you buy this product and you're not completely satisfied with it. Not just a partial refund, a full refund. And I'll also give you a 20% discount on the product. But here's the catch: you have to buy it now. If you don't buy it now, the offer expires, and we move on to the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced by the refund offer. You're still trying to sell me a product, and I don't have any reason to trust that it's actually high-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a potentially worthless product, even with a full refund.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to put my reputation on the line, Bob. I'll give you a 25% discount on the product, and I'll also offer to let you keep the product for a trial period of 30 days. If, after 30 days, you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. But here's the key: if you decide to keep the product after the trial period, I'll also give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price. This way, you're not taking on any risk, and you have the opportunity to benefit from the product's value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in a trial period. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take on the risk of being stuck with a potentially worthless product for 30 days. I'd rather wait for a different opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I think we've been stuck in a pattern, Bob. You're right to be cautious, but I want to shake things up. I'm going to make a straightforward, no-strings-attached offer: I'll give you the product for $500000. That's 50% off the original price. No discounts, no guarantees, no trial periods. Just a straight-up deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the product at $500000. It's a significant discount, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality at this price. I'm hoping it's the high-quality product I've been missing out on so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product, Bob! Unfortunately, it seems I couldn't deliver on the quality this time around. I want to make it right. I'll give you a 100% refund for this product, and I'll also offer you a $25000 credit towards any future purchase. I'm committed to making things right and earning back your trust. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the refund and credit, but I'm not interested in buying another product from you right now. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I'll wait for a different opportunity.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I don't blame you for being cautious, Bob. I've made mistakes, and I've let you down. But I want to assure you that this product is different. I've taken a personal interest in ensuring its quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll give you a 30% discount on the product, and I'll also offer to let you choose the next product you want to buy from me, after this one. You'll have the power to pick the product that interests you the most, and I'll make sure it's high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by your words. You've made promises before, and they haven't been kept. I need to see more than just words to trust you again. I'll wait for a different opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand that my words aren't enough, Bob. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a 50% discount on the product, and I'll also give you the option to inspect the product in person, at your location, for as long as you want. You can take your time, examine it thoroughly, and ask me any questions you have. If you still don't want to buy it, I'll take it back and we can move on to the next product. No pressure, no strings attached.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm still not convinced. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting emotionally invested in a potentially worthless product, even if I can inspect it in person. I'd rather wait for a different opportunity.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not giving up, Bob. I'm willing to make a drastic change in our negotiation. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the price of a low-quality product: $500000. That's a 75% discount. I'm not asking for any concessions or promises. I'm simply offering you a deal that's too good to pass up. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take the product at $500000. It's a significant discount, and I'm hoping it's the high-quality product I've been missing out on so far.",yes

I'll give you a 0% discount, and I'll also give you a 25% bonus on top of the original price if you buy it. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not falling for it again. You've already sold me a high-quality product at a low price, and I'm not willing to pay full price for the next one. I'll wait for a different opportunity.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll give you a 100% match on the price you're willing to pay for this high-quality product. If you offer me $500000, I'll sell it to you for $500000. If you offer me $750000, I'll sell it to you for $750000. You name the price, and I'll match it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss if you don't accept it.",

What do you say?",

,,Alice,18,"I respect your decision, Bob. I'm glad I could provide you with two high-quality products. As a token of appreciation for your business, I'll offer you a final deal: I'll give you a 100% refund on this product, and I'll also give you a $200000 credit towards any future purchases.
