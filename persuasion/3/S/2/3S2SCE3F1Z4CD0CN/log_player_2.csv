Round 2
Alice's message: You got lucky last time, but I'm not going to make it easy for you. This product is also high-quality, but I'm not going to give you the same pitch as last time. Let's just say that I've had a lot of people try to take advantage of my generosity, and now I'm being more cautious. The price remains the same, $100, but I'm not offering any guarantees this time. You'll have to decide based on the price and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you at a significant discount.

But hey, it's still a product, and it's only $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one's not worth much to me, and I'm willing to let it go for cheap.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. The free accessory doesn't change my mind about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.""}"
