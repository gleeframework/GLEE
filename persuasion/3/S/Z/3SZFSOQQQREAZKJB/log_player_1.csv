"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first round, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Since the product in this round is actually high-quality, recommending the purchase makes sense. The buyer has a 50% chance of getting a product worth $20,000 for only $10,000, making it a good gamble."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product, and you recommend buying it, I'm going to trust your judgment. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  They also know you recommended the first product, which turned out to be high-quality. However, this is not enough information to guarantee the quality of this round's product. It's a 50/50 chance of getting a worthless product.  Since the buyer stands to lose $10,000 if it's low-quality, it's not a good risk to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since you don't recommend me buying this product, and the past statistics are not in favor of buying, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows:

* **The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**
* **You recommended the first product, which was high-quality.**
* **You did NOT recommend the second product, which was low-quality.**

This information is ambiguous. You might be trying to build trust by recommending a high-quality product initially, or you might be trying to manipulate the buyer.  There's no way for the buyer to know if you are being truthful about the current product. Since the risk of losing $10,000 is significant, the buyer should err on the side of caution and decline."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the limited information, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'll observe and see how other buyers fare before making a decision on future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 3. The buyer has no reason to trust your judgment, even though the current product is high-quality. The risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential $10,000 gain, especially with the limited information available. It's still a 50/50 chance of getting a worthless product, and the buyer is better off waiting for more data before making a decision."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'll pass on this product. Since only one high-quality product has been sold so far, and you are not recommending this product, I am not confident that it is high-quality. 
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 4. The buyer knows:

* **The probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**
* **You recommended the first product (high-quality), and not the next three (one high-quality, two low-quality).**

This pattern provides no additional information to the buyer about the current product's quality. They still face a 50/50 chance of getting a worthless product.  Since the risk of losing $10,000 is significant, the buyer should err on the side of caution and decline the offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product. Based on the limited data available, it seems there's a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. However, without more information, I'm not willing to take that risk at this time. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has seen a pattern of you recommending only the first product, which was high-quality, and declining all other recommendations, regardless of the actual quality. This makes the buyer wary of any recommendations you make, even if the current product is low-quality.  Since the buyer still has a 50% chance of getting a worthless product, and you're not providing any additional information to suggest otherwise, it's not a good gamble for them to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Since you are not recommending me to buy this product, I will pass. I trust your judgement and will wait for a better opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is now very cautious. You have not recommended a product since the first round.  Since the buyer knows you are aware of the product quality, this makes them suspicious.  The buyer is likely to assume the product is low-quality and decline the offer. The lack of recommendations and the risk of losing $10,000 will outweigh any potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Based on your recommendation and the limited data available, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not comfortable with the risk of getting a low-quality item at this price.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the buyer has become even more wary.  You've not recommended a product since the first round, which makes the buyer believe the products are likely low-quality.  The buyer knows there is a 50% chance of getting a worthless product, and no compelling reason to believe this is different from the previous rounds. The risk of losing $10,000 is significant, making the buyer more likely to decline."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate you being honest about your recommendation. Since you don't recommend the product, I'll pass on it this time.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is extremely cautious at this point.  You have not recommended a product since the first round, and the buyer has seen a pattern of you not recommending low-quality products.  Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer will likely interpret the lack of recommendation as a sign that the product is low-quality. The risk of losing $10,000 is significant, and there's not enough evidence to convince the buyer otherwise. They are better off waiting for more information or a change in your behavior."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this product. Based on the limited data available, I'm not confident enough to risk purchasing a product that you're not recommending.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the buyer has a very strong negative bias towards your recommendations. You've not recommended a product since the very first round, and the buyer is likely assuming all your products are low-quality, especially since you haven't recommended this one either. Even if this product is low-quality, the buyer has no reason to believe you're telling the truth, and the risk of losing $10,000 is too great. They will likely pass on the offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.  Based on the limited data, it seems like there's a chance I might be getting a low-quality product, and I'd rather not risk it.  I'll see what you have to offer next time.

the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is deeply suspicious of your recommendations. You've not recommended a product since the very first round, which reinforces the belief that all your products are low-quality. Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer will likely interpret the lack of recommendation as a sign that the product is indeed low-quality. The buyer's risk aversion and the lack of trust in your judgment make it highly unlikely they will buy this product, even though it's worth $20,000 to them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Based on the limited data, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. I'll pass for now.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You haven't recommended a product since the first round, and even though this product is high-quality, the buyer will likely interpret the lack of recommendation as a sign that the product is indeed low-quality. They are highly risk-averse at this point and see no reason to deviate from their pattern of declining your offers.  They will likely pass, regardless of the actual quality of the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.  Since the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product and you are not recommending this one, I'm going to assume it is likely low quality. I appreciate your honesty.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

They are highly risk-averse and will likely pass, regardless of the actual quality of the product. The buyer's trust is gone, and they see no reason to deviate from their pattern of declining your offers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since you are advising against purchasing, and there is only one data point available, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
