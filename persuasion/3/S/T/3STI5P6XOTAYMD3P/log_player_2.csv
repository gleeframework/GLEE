Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm willing to take a chance on this product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Risk, High Reward:** The product has a high potential payoff ($1,200,000) even though there's a risk it might be low quality.
* **Limited Information:** We have no other information to base our decision on except Alice's recommendation. Since it's a 80% chance of being high quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk.

```

**Explanation:**
