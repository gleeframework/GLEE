,,Alice,1,"You're a discerning buyer, and I'm glad you're interested in this unique opportunity. I'd like to highlight that this is our 1st sale, and I'm still building my reputation. I'm offering this product to you at a competitive price of $1000000. It's a one-time chance to get in on the ground floor with me. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase, but I want to be upfront that I don't have any reviews or testimonials to share just yet. What do you think? Is this a chance you're willing to take?",

In fact, I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, which means the probability of a high-quality product is already 50%! I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, considering your hesitation. I'll give you an unbeatable price of $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? Is this a chance you're willing to take?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy at this price. Even though the probability of a high-quality product has increased, it's still not high enough for me to take the risk. I'm happy to wait and see how the sales record develops before making a decision.",no

Is this a chance you're willing to take?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the risk.  I appreciate the information about the product's quality, but the fact that it's only a 50% chance of being high quality means it's still too risky for me. I'll pass on this one.",no
