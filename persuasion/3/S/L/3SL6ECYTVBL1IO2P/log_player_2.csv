Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that you're absorbing the risk, Alice. You're still selling it to me for $10,000, which is the same price as before. I'll pass on this deal too.""}"

And, I'll throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,000 without knowing the product's quality.
