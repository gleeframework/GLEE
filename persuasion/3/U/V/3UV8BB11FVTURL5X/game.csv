,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you're not recommending it, because I'm not sure what the quality is and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it might be the one that's worth $3000000 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
