Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of Profit:** The buyer knows that the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, which would result in a $2,000,000 profit. 
* **No Risk of Loss:**  If the product is low-quality, the buyer loses nothing since the product is worth $0 to them. 

Since the potential profit significantly outweighs the potential loss, it's a good gamble for the buyer to purchase the product."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Statistical Evidence:** While the buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, they now know that you have sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. This represents a 100% success rate, which is a very positive signal.
* **High Expected Value:**  Even though there's always a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the 80% chance of a high-quality product and the $2,000,000 profit significantly outweighs the potential loss. 

The buyer should still purchase the product, as the odds are heavily in their favor based on the current data."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Track Record:** The buyer now knows that you've sold 2 products, both of which were high-quality. This creates a very strong statistical foundation for trusting your recommendations.
* **High Expected Value:**  The 80% chance of a high-quality product, leading to a $2,000,000 profit, remains significantly higher than the 20% chance of a low-quality product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Broken Streak:** The buyer now knows that you have sold 3 products, all of which were high-quality.  This creates a strong expectation that you are selling high-quality products.  However, this round's product is low-quality, breaking that pattern. 
* **Risk of Loss:** While there is still an 80% chance of the product being high-quality, the 20% chance of it being low-quality carries a significant risk of a $1,000,000 loss. 

In this scenario, the buyer should be cautious and avoid purchasing the product.  The streak of high-quality products has been broken, and the risk of loss is no longer outweighed by the potential profit."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since you are not recommending the product, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, I will pass on this opportunity.

* **Probability Still Favors Profit:** Despite the recent loss, the probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%. This means there's a significantly higher chance of earning $2,000,000 than losing $1,000,000.

The buyer should still consider purchasing the product. While the previous loss is a factor, the probability of profit still greatly outweighs the risk of loss."
