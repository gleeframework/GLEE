As you know, the probability of a high-quality item is 33.33%. I'm glad you're interested in purchasing one, but I must warn you that the previous buyer's refund policy was a one-time offer. This product is sold as-is, and the price remains $1000000. However, I can offer you a unique insight: the previous buyer's purchase was a low-quality item, which means I still have a 66.67% chance of offering a low-quality item in the next round. Would you like to take the risk and buy this high-quality product?
