I'd like to offer a new perspective: if I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row, it would be a statistically significant deviation from the expected 20% probability.

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** Alice has a 60% success rate (9/15) of selling high-quality products, which is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. This indicates that her recommendations are likely to be valuable.
* **Discount and Premium:** The discount and premium service significantly increase the potential value of the product. Even if it is low-quality, the premium service could make it worth something in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product with the added value from the premium service outweighs the risk."
