high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and it's my first chance to get a product at the fixed price of $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the product or just a random guess.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you can provide any insights on why you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which is a proportion of 1/3. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the observed proportion of high-quality products sold (1/3) is lower than the true probability. This suggests that the remaining products may have a higher probability of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to see if you're biased towards recommending low-quality products or if there's some other pattern at play."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product, and I've seen that the proportion of high-quality products sold is only 1/4. I'd like to know more before making a decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 5 products sold was high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. The proportion of high-quality products sold is still low, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
