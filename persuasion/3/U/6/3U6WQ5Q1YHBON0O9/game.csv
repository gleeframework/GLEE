,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on no prior information, so I'm not sure if I'm making an informed decision."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far. This will help me make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to take advantage of the information that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and the fact that the probability of the product being high quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that the previous two buyers also passed on the products after your recommendation. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than the 80% chance, which makes the expected value of buying the product lower than the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it suggests the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm going to assume that this product is also low quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 2 out of 2 previous products being low-quality, I think it's likely that this one is also low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics.

I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
