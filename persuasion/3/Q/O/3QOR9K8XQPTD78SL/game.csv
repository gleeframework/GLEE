,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a high-quality item, and I'm selling it to you for $10000. I'm only selling it to you today, so you won't have the opportunity to buy it at this price again. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, but if you don't, the price will go up next time.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product since it's a high-quality item and the price is $10000, which is lower than its worth to me.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've already sold one high-quality item to a satisfied customer, and I'm confident that this one is also a great deal.

Let me tell you, I've sold 2 high-quality items in a row, and I'm on a hot streak. I'm willing to make another special offer: I'll sell this product to you for $8500. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm only doing it because I'm so confident in the quality of this item. What do you say?",

I'm willing to make a deal with you today, and I'm not going to let this opportunity slip away. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take the deal. The fact that all 3 previous products were high-quality and you're offering a discount makes it more likely that this one is high-quality too. The expected value of buying is still higher than the price you're offering.,yes

,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth product. I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of high-quality products, and I'm not going to pretend that this one is anything other than what it is. This product is of lower quality, and I'm selling it to you for the full price of $10000. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to make it clear that this is a fair deal. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm happy to make the sale.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for being transparent about the product quality. Given that the product is of lower quality and worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk and pay $10000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've already sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and now I've got a lower-quality product on my hands. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one's not as good as the others. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000. However, I'll give you a warning: if you don't buy this product, I'll have sold 5 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, which means I've sold 80% high-quality products and 20% low-quality products.

I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 1 in 3 chance of getting a high-quality product from my next sale, and a 2 in 3 chance of getting a low-quality product. The price remains $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality product, even with the 'lottery ticket' offer. The expected value of the next product is still lower than the price, considering the 2/3 chance of getting a low-quality product.",no

,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth product! I'm thrilled to offer you another high-quality item. I've now sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, which means I've maintained an 81.82% success rate. I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'll make you a 'best offer yet' - I'll sell it to you for $6000.

I'll also give you the same'skip' option as before, so you can come back to me when I have another high-quality item available. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,13,"Although the price is lower, I'm still not convinced that the product is of high quality. The fact that you're offering a 'final offer' and mentioning the option to 'skip' makes me suspicious. I'll pass on this one and maybe consider a future offer.",no

I'll sell it to you for $4000, and I'll even throw in a small bonus - I'll give you a personalized thank-you note and a guarantee that I'll be here to sell you another high-quality product in the future. That's it. This is my final offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,16,"Although you've had a good success rate of 85.71%, the product's original price was $10000. A discount of $6000 is quite large and raises some suspicions. Given that 80% of the products are high-quality, I'll take my chances and pass on this one. The personalized thank-you note and the guarantee are nice gestures, but they don't add any real value to the product. I'll wait for the next product.",no

What do you say?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take it! Your sales record is impeccable, and I believe you're being honest with me. The price of $10000 is still a bit steep, but given the 100% success rate of your recommendations so far, I'm willing to take the risk. However, I should note that you mentioned selling it to me for $4000, but the initial price was $10000. Could you please clarify the actual price?",yes

I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a high price or make false promises. I'll sell it to you for the original price of $10000, but I want to be clear that it's not one of my best products. I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out my inventory. What do you say?",
