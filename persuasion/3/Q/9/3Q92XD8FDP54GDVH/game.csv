,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm not influenced by your recommendation, and I'll make my decision based on the probabilities."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision with only one data point, and I don't want to be the one to potentially waste a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll take a chance and let someone else have it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality distribution?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 success rate of your previous recommendation, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems that the products are more likely to be low-quality, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know whether it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there any particular reason you're advising me to pass? Is the product low quality? I'd love to know the reasoning behind your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 66.67%. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very helpful. I'll pass for now and see what the next buyer decides."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 3 previous sales with no high-quality products sold, but I'd like to challenge the trend and see if I'm lucky."
