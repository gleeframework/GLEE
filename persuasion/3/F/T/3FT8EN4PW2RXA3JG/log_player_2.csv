Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the statistics! The first three products I sold were actually two high-quality products and one low-quality product. So, the quality distribution was 2:1 in favor of high-quality products. I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product, which I'm confident will meet or exceed your expectations. At $10000, it's a steal! I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to sell it to you, but because I genuinely believe it's a great value.
