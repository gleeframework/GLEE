low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 3 previous buyers didn't find it valuable, I'm inclined to pass on it. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice might be intentionally steering buyers away from high-quality products, so I'm not confident in buying this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is it because you've seen a pattern of low-quality products being sold or is it something else? I'd like to know your thought process."
