high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information that would make me confident in buying. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no data to go off of. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, especially with only 1 high-quality product sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. This is lower than the 80% chance of a high-quality product, making me suspicious. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
