,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendations, but I still need more information.  You haven't explained your reasoning for recommending these products, and I'm hesitant to risk such a large amount of money without a better understanding of your knowledge and selection process."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm starting to get concerned. You've recommended two high-quality products in a row, and I haven't been able to buy either. This leads me to believe that you may be intentionally recommending low-quality products, hoping I'll make a mistake. Until you provide me with a clearer explanation of your selection process and offer some evidence of your trustworthiness, I cannot risk buying any further products."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, while I appreciate the lack of recommendation this time, I'm still not ready to buy. You've consistently recommended products that turned out to be high-quality, yet I've been unable to purchase them.  This leads me to believe that you may be deliberately withholding information or manipulating the situation. Until I have a clearer understanding of your motives and a greater level of trust in you, I will not be purchasing any products."

This pattern makes me suspect you're manipulating the information to make me lose money.  Until you provide a clear explanation of your selection process and demonstrate a genuine willingness to be transparent, I will not be buying any products."
