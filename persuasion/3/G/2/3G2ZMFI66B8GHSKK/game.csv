,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000 and then you'll get a high-quality product next."
