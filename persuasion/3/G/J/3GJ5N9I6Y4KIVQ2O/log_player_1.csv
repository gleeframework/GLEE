"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information. Since the product is worth $3000000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and both possibilities have a 50% chance, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.  Could you offer a lower price or provide some more information about this specific product?
