However, if you don't like the discount, I can give you a guarantee that I'll offer you a better product in the next round if you decline this one.

Given that you've already purchased a high-quality product from me, I'm offering you a'second-chance' deal on this one. I'll give you a 75% discount on this low-quality product, so the price would be $2500.
