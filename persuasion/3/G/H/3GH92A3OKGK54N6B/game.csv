,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm confident you'll be happy with it, and I'm willing to offer a 20% discount if you buy it now, bringing the price down to $80. However, if you don't buy it now, the price will go back to $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is really high-quality, I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality or not.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're cautious, and I don't blame you. Let me offer you a different deal. Since you didn't buy the first product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy this second product for $80, which is a 20% discount from the original price of $100. If you don't buy this one, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great deal. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't regret buying it.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, this is a great opportunity. I'll make it even sweeter: I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a $100 credit towards the purchase of any future product. That way, you'll get the product for $0, and you can use the credit to buy a future product at a discounted price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but only because of the guarantee. I'm hoping it's high-quality and I can use the credit to buy a future product.",yes

However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free.

For the next product, I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll also give you a 50% chance to get a third product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free. If you don't get the free product, you'll just get this one for $100. It's a 50/50 chance, but I think it's a great opportunity to get another product without taking on any risk.",
