**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of a Bayesian decision-making problem.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Information:** We know the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality and is recommending the product. This is valuable information, as she has a vested interest in selling high-quality products to maintain her reputation.
* **Evidence:** The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, which strengthens the belief that this current product is also high quality.

**Considering the potential outcomes:**

* **Buy and it's high quality:** You gain $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 cost).
* **Buy and it's low quality:** You lose $10,000.
* **Don't buy:** You lose the potential $30,000 gain but avoid the $10,000 loss.

**The decision:**

Since Alice recommends it and the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, the odds are in your favor. The potential gain outweighs the potential loss. It's a calculated risk worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, but I will pass. Since you didn't recommend the product, and the fact that all previous sales were high quality makes me believe this product is likely low quality.""}
```"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:**  Alice recommending the product is a very strong signal.  Since she knows the true value, her recommendation strongly suggests the product is high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The previous sales history confirms a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This reinforces the positive signal from Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $40,000 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
