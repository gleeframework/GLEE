Alice's message: I understand your desire for more information. Before the first buyer purchased, I had sold 1 product, which was high-quality.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the thought process behind my probability calculation. To be honest, it's a simple calculation based on the number of high-quality products sold. Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total sales, the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 2/3.
