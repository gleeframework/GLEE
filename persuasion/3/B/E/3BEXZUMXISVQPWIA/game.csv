high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm going to take the chance and see what I get."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that Alice knows the value of the product to me, and her recommendation might be influenced by that. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for the price of $10000. If you're just not recommending it, I'm not sure I should pay full price for it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers who purchased were unlucky and got low-quality products, or is there something else I should know?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate of your previous recommendations, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not sure if I should take the risk based on the previous sales record. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product if there's a good chance it's low quality, and since you're recommending to pass, I'm guessing the product is likely low quality."
