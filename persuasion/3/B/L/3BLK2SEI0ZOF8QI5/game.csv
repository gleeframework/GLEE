,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the previous buyer got a high-quality product, but since no high-quality product has been sold yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not trusting your recommendation."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to pass on it as well. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 buyers have passed on the products before me, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see if the next product has a higher quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy based on the current statistics, but I'd like to hear your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is it because you've seen a pattern of low-quality products in the past, or is there another reason?"
