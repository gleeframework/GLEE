,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right to be cautious. Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 low-quality product out of 2 total products, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower than the overall average. But I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll sell this product to you for $900000, a discount of $100000 from the original price. It's a risk, but it could be a steal!",

I'll give you a deal that's hard to pass up: I'll sell this product to you for $950000, and I'll throw in a 100% money-back guarantee if it's not high-quality. You've got nothing to lose!",

I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling these products for a while, and I've got a good feeling about this one. It's worth every penny of the $1000000. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still cautious due to the 2 low-quality products sold so far. I'll take a chance, but I'll only buy the product if it's high-quality.",yes
