high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 so far. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 3/4, which is a strong indication that this one is also high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 so far, and then this one turned out to be low-quality. This means that the streak was just a coincidence, and the probability of a product being low-quality is actually 50%. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are now back to 50/50. Would you like to take a chance?",
