You've seen the results, and I'm confident that you'll love this product just as much. Would you like to take advantage of this streak and buy it for $10000?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm also a little skeptical since it's just based on a small sample size. I'll buy it, but I'm hoping it's not just a coincidence that the first two products were high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a new product, and I want to assure you that my track record is still strong. Although the last two products were high-quality, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.
