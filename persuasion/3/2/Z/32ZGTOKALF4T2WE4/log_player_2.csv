Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it's already gone! I'm glad you're interested in this new product. Since my previous sale was a low-quality item, I want to assure you that this one is definitely high-quality. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 50%. However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this one: I'll sell it to you for $500000, a 50% discount from the original price of $1000000. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your curiosity about the previous product. I can tell you that the buyer who purchased it didn't have any information to go on, and they essentially took a wild guess. They ended up buying a low-quality product for the full price of $1000000. Now, let's talk about this new product. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 33.33%.

Alice's message: I can share with you that the previous buyer's decision was indeed based on a lack of information. They didn't have any data on the product's quality, and they were essentially taking a wild guess. They didn't consider any specific factors or use any particular strategy to inform their decision. They simply decided to buy it. Now, let's focus on this new product. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 50%.

Alice's message: Good questions! Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total, and 1 low-quality product out of 6 total, I can tell you that the probability of selling a low-quality product to a buyer who passed on a product previously is 1/2, since the previous buyer's decision didn't affect the product's quality. As for the probability of a buyer passing on a high-quality product, it's around 50% so far, since 3 buyers have passed on products and 2 of those products were high-quality. Now, let's focus on this new product. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total, and 2 low-quality products out of 6 total, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 25%.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the low probability of this product being high-quality. However, I'd like to point out that you're not actually seeing the probability of it being high-quality, but rather the probability of it being high-quality given that you passed on the previous product. Since you're starting from a clean slate, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 50%, the same as it was for the previous buyers.
