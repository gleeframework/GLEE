high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. Given the statistics, it's likely that the previous buyers have already purchased low-quality products, and there's a higher chance that the next product will also be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
