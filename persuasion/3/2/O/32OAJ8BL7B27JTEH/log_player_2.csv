**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have one previous sale to go on, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. While she has a vested interest in selling, her recommendation is a valuable signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100.  

**This decision is a calculated gamble based on the limited information available and Alice's recommendation.**"
