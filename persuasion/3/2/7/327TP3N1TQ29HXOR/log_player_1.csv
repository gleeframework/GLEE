Will you take the chance and join the ranks of my satisfied customers?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the information you provided about your past sales record is irrelevant to the current product's quality. Since each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality or low-quality, I will not make a decision based on your past sales. Furthermore, I'd like to correct you that you don't have a 60% success rate since no products have been sold yet in this game. I'll pass on this product as the price of $10000 (or $9000 with the discount) is not favorable to me given the 50% chance of the product being low-quality.

With a 50% chance of the product being low quality and worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $10000, even with the bonus package. The expected value of the product is $10000 (0.5 x $20000 + 0.5 x $0), which is equal to the price you're asking, but the risk of losing the entire investment is too high for me.
