"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is worth $125 to you, and only a 20% chance of being low quality (worth $0), the expected value of buying the product is positive:

* Expected Value = (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) = $100

Even though the product costs $100, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product.  It's worth taking the gamble."
