low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. I'll give you a straightforward message this time: I've sold products to you before, and you know that I'm willing to stand behind my products. This one is not one of my best offerings. Would you like to take a chance on it for the price of $1000000?",
