**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is valuable information.
* **Previous sales:**  One high-quality product was sold out of one purchase. This suggests a higher chance of the current product being high quality, as Alice is likely to recommend high-quality products more often.
* **Value:** Even if the product is low quality, you're not losing money because you're buying it for $100 and it's worth $0 to you. However, if it's high quality, you're making a profit of $25.

**Overall:** The potential reward outweighs the potential risk, so it's worth taking a chance."

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:** 100% of the products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests Alice is very good at identifying high-quality products and recommending them. 
* **Limited risk:** Even if the product is low quality, the loss is only $100. The potential gain ($25) significantly outweighs this risk given the strong success rate."
