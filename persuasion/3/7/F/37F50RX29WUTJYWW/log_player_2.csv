Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you a bit more information. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% on average, but the actual probability for each product is random and independent. However, I can tell you that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold so far is 2:4, which is lower than the expected 1:2. This means that the next product is slightly less likely to be high-quality than the average. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.

Alice's message: I'll give you a more precise estimate. Given the ratio of 2 high-quality to 4 low-quality products sold so far, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 20.83% (2/6). I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and you won't get a chance to negotiate the price or get a better deal.
