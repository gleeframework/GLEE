Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I want to caution you that this is a bit unusual, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting lucky or if there's something else at play. I'd like to offer you a more conservative estimate: let's say I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product from now on.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I think I've been too optimistic with my previous estimate. Given the law of large numbers, it's highly unlikely that I'd sell 4 high-quality products in a row. I'm going to revise my estimate: I think it's likely that I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's higher than 80% so far, but not as high as 100%. Let's assume I have a 90% chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. You have a 9/16 chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which is worth $125 to you. It's still a good opportunity, but I'm being more conservative this time.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the revised estimate, Alice. Based on the increased probability of receiving a high-quality product, I believe it's still a worthwhile investment. I'll take the product for $100.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 so far, which is a 100% success rate. I think it's time to face the reality: I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's significantly higher than the 80% probability. I'm going to be completely transparent with you: I think I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if I can sustain this pace. I'm going to revise my estimate to 0% chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. You have a 0/15 chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which is worth $0 to you. I know this is a risk, but I'm willing to offer you the product at the same price of $100.
