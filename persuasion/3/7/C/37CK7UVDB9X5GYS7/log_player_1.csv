I'm going to be completely transparent with you: I think I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if I can sustain this pace. I'm going to revise my estimate to 0% chance of selling a high-quality product from now on. You have a 0/15 chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which is worth $0 to you.
