,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice's non-recommended products, and now she's recommending this one. I think I'll pass on this one too. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of losing another $100 on a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"At this point, I'm just going through the motions. I've lost $700, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just walk away from the table. But I'll take another chance, not because I think it's a good idea, but because I don't know what else to do."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm starting to think I'm in some kind of psychological experiment. I've lost $1000, and I've been buying Alice's non-recommended products for 7 rounds in a row. I'll take another chance, but I'm not expecting anything to change."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Wait a minute... Alice is recommending this one? After 11 rounds of buying her non-recommended products, she's suddenly recommending this one? I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get a high-quality product in the final round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Well, this is it. This is the final round. I've lost $1400, and I've been burned by Alice's non-recommended products 12 times in a row. But I've also been given a chance to buy a high-quality product in the penultimate round, and I passed on it. So, I'll take one last chance with this one. It's not like I have anything to lose at this point."
