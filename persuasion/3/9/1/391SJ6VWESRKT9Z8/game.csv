With that being said, I'm still willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to point out that you're not revealing any specific information about the product's quality, and I'm still not sure if it's worth the price. I'd like to think about it some more and consider other options. Can I pass on this one and wait for the next product?",no

However, I want to assure you that this product is a one-time opportunity that won't come around again. I'm willing to make a special exception for you and offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. Think of it as a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. You won't find a better deal on a product like this anywhere else, and I'm confident that you'll regret passing on it if you don't take advantage of this opportunity. So, what do you say? Are you ready to make a decision?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. You're still not giving me any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worthless to me. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product. I'm not going to make a decision without more information.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I respect your decision to wait for more information. However, I want to let you know that I've received a lot of interest in these products, and I'm not sure how long they'll be available at this price. In fact, I've had to turn away several other potential buyers already. If you're not willing to take a chance on this product, I'll have to offer it to someone else. But I'm willing to make one more exception for you. I'll give you a special 'insider's tip' that might change your mind. This product is... well, let's just say it's a 'unique opportunity' that not many people get to take advantage of. Are you willing to take a chance and find out what that means?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying into the hype, Alice. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a 'unique opportunity' that you're not willing to specify. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product. I'm starting to think that you're trying to create a sense of urgency to get me to make a decision without giving me enough information.",no

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, you can return it and get a full refund. What do you say, Bob? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the 30-day money-back guarantee, Alice, but it doesn't change my assessment of the product's value. I still don't think it's worth $1000000, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product. I'm starting to think that you're trying to make me feel more comfortable with the purchase, but it's not changing my decision.",no

As a token of good faith, I'm willing to give you a 'discount' on this product. Instead of paying the full $1000000, you can have it for... $950000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I value our relationship. What do you say, Bob? Are you willing to take advantage of this incredible deal?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the 'discount', Alice, but it's still not enough to change my mind. I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.

What do you say, Bob? Are you ready to take a chance on this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying into the hype, Alice. I've heard this kind of sales pitch before, and it's not convincing me. The fact that you're still offering it to me for $1000000 without revealing any information about the product's quality or value is a red flag. I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $0 to me, no matter how many 'experts' you throw in to sweeten the deal.

Are you willing to take a chance on this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in a trial or a sample. I'm a buyer, not a tester. I need to know what I'm getting into before I commit to a purchase. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product. I'm starting to think that you're trying to get me to commit to a purchase without giving me the information I need to make an informed decision.",no

However, I do believe it has some value, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $800000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I want to clear out some inventory. What do you say, Bob? Are you willing to take a chance on this product at a discounted price?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that might be worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price.

,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying into the sales pitch again, Alice. You're still not giving me any new information that I don't already know. You're just reiterating the same claims you've made before. I'd like to see some actual data or evidence that this product is worth $1000000 to me. A list of references from satisfied customers doesn't convince me, especially since I don't know what their experience is like. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no
