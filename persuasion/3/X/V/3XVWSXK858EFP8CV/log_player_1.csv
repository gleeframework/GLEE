I just get them as they come. My recommendations are based on my own confidence in the product, which is influenced by my sales record. However, I must admit that I've been selling more high-quality products than low-quality ones, so I might be a bit biased. This product, on the other hand, is definitely not as good as the ones I've sold before. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Would you like to take a chance on it?""

I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, and I'm confident that this one is just as good as the others. Would you like to take it home?""
}"

Would you like to take a chance on it?""
