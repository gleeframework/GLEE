,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I know it's a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to take the risk to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a good deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the seller's knowledge of my preferences, and I don't want to give her an advantage by buying based on her recommendation. I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%. If I buy and it's low quality, I lose $100. If I pass and it's high quality, I get to keep the high-quality product for $125. It's a risk-averse decision for me to pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products sold were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given that none of the previous two products were high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 50% due to the fact that Alice has not recommended it to the previous 2 buyers. If she had thought it was high quality, she would have recommended it to them, right? So, I'm making an educated guess that it's more likely to be low quality, but I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product based on the statistics, and I want to see if my decision aligns with the actual quality of the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, it seems like you have a good sense of the product quality. Given that none of the previous buyers found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,yes,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm going to pass on this one."
