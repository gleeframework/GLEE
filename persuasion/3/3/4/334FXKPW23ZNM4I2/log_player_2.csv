Alice's message: I understand your concerns and willingness to make an informed decision. By 'improving quality', I mean that I've made adjustments to my production process and quality control measures to ensure that the products I sell are of higher quality. This includes using higher-quality materials, implementing stricter testing and inspection procedures, and training my team to focus on quality control. As for the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, it's based on a general assessment of my sales data over the past few months. I've sold a total of 18 products, with 9 being high-quality and 9 being low-quality.

You're right that the past sales data doesn't necessarily reflect the true probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to offer a possible explanation for the discrepancy.
