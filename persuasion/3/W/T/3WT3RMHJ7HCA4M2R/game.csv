,,Alice,2,"As you've already seen a low-quality product, I want to assure you that the next one has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. If you're not interested in taking the risk, I can offer you a guarantee that the next product is not the first one we've seen, but I'll have to charge you the full $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Now that you've experienced the quality of one of our products, I'd like to offer you a simple proposition. Since you're starting fresh, I'll give you a'reset' option.

However, I'll add a personal touch: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a detailed explanation of what went wrong and how we can improve our quality control process.

However, I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' option: if you buy this product, I'll give you the opportunity to buy the next two products at a 20% discount, regardless of their quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get two products at a lower price, and you'll know exactly what you're getting.",
