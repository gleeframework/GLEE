Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! We're glad you're interested in our next product. As of now, we've sold 2 products, with 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and we've seen 1 high-quality product out of 2, we can infer that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%.

Alice's message: We understand your concerns! We'd like to provide more context. Our products are randomly selected from a batch, and the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. However, our sales record so far might not be representative of the entire batch. We've sold 2 products, with 2 high-quality products out of 2. This might be a coincidence, or it might indicate a bias in the sample. We can't guarantee the quality of the next product, but we can offer you a unique opportunity to take a chance.

Alice's message: We understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence. You're right, our current sales record might be skewed. We've decided to provide more transparency and share our overall product distribution. Out of the 20 products in our batch, we expect 10 to be high-quality and 10 to be low-quality.
