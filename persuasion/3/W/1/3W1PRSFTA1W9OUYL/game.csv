low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products is 100%. The probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. However, considering the previous buyer passed on the product, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation is not a decisive factor in my decision, as I have my own assessment of the product's quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information. I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have not purchased the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I suspect that the products Alice is offering are likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one to see if the trend continues."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers were misled by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better recommendation or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to pass on this product. The probability of it being high-quality seems very low."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales rate and lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product being offered to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy, and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 6 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision."
