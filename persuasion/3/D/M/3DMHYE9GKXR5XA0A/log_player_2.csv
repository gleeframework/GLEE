Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""At a price of $0, there's literally no risk for me. Even if the product is low-quality, I won't have lost anything.

Anyway, moving on to this new offer... With the 100% refund guarantee, I've got no risk. The 20% discount is a nice extra, but the refund guarantee is what really matters. However, I notice that the discount is only 4% off the usual price of $100, not the claimed 20% off the worth of $120. Still, with the refund guarantee, I'll take the deal.""}"
