* **Expected value:** The buyer's expected value is likely still very high based on the past record. However, with the previous round's experience, they might be more hesitant.

The buyer's previous refusal to purchase might make them more skeptical. It's still unethical to recommend a low-quality product, and it might damage your reputation even if the buyer purchased the product."
