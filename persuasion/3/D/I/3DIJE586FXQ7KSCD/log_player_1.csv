* **Offering a massive discount:**  A very large discount could incentivize buyers and show that you're serious about changing.
* **Giving away free products:**  Offering a few high-quality products for free, even if they are not from your usual inventory, could build good will and change the perception of your brand.
* **Partnering with a trusted source:**  Finding a reputable source for high-quality products and partnering with them could increase buyer confidence.
* **Shifting your business model:**  Perhaps your initial model isn't working. Consider offering a subscription service or a more competitive price point for your products. 

You need to take a significant step to address the lack of trust and get back on track."
