,,Alice,1,"This product is a one-time offer, and it's a great opportunity to get a product from me. I'm willing to give you a 100% guarantee that it's worth at least $500000 to you. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a free consultation to help you understand its value. It's a steal at $1000000!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's only guaranteed to be worth at least $500000. The expected value of this product is $1000000, which is the same as the price. I'll wait for more information.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I'm glad you're willing to wait for more information. Let me tell you that this product is from a new line that has been getting excellent reviews from our top clients. I'm offering you a special deal on this product, and I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now. This brings the price down to $800000. Additionally, I'm including a 10-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty period. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the new information. The product is still worth either $0 or $2000000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate them. I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product thoroughly before making a decision. I'll send you a detailed report on the product's specifications, and you can have an expert of your choice inspect it. If the expert confirms that the product is high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. If the expert confirms it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we can start fresh with the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in paying $900000 for a product, even if I get a 10% discount. I'd rather have the option to walk away and not lose anything if the product is low-quality. I'd like to take you up on the offer to have an expert inspect the product, but I'll still need to decide whether to buy it after the inspection.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Instead of a discount, I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' price of $1200000, which is a 40% premium over the expected value. However, I'll also give you the option to walk away with a full refund if the expert inspection confirms the product is low-quality. This way, you'll have the best of both worlds: the potential for a high-quality product at a premium price, and the security of being able to walk away without losing anything if it's not up to par.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying a 40% premium over the expected value, even if I do get the option to walk away with a full refund. The expected value of the product is $1000000, and I'm not willing to pay $1200000 for it. I'd like to continue with the inspection and wait for the expert's report.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you the option to buy the product at the expected value of $1000000, with the same inspection and walk-away clause. This way, you'll have the option to get a high-quality product at the expected value, or walk away with a full refund if it's low-quality. I'll even sweeten the deal by including a complimentary service that adds significant value to the product, which would normally cost $200000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a fair price, with added value on top.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not willing to pay the expected value of $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. The added value of the complimentary service is nice, but it's not enough to change my decision. I'd like to continue with the inspection and wait for the expert's report.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to take a different approach. Given that the expert inspection hasn't convinced you to buy the previous products, I'd like to offer you a 'no-risk' deal. If the expert inspection confirms that this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we can start fresh with the next product. However, if the inspection confirms that it's high-quality, I'll give you a 50% discount on the price, bringing it down to $500000. This way, you'll have the option to get a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price, or walk away with a full refund if it's low-quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced by the offer. The 50% discount is significant, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying $500000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a significant concession. Given that you're still hesitant, I'll offer you a 'certification' that the product is high-quality, which would normally cost $100000. This certification comes with a 100% guarantee that the product is high-quality, and I'll include it in the price. I'll sell the product to you for $900000, which is a 55% discount from the original price. This way, you'll have the certainty that the product is high-quality, and you'll be getting it at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's already been certified as high-quality. If I'm going to pay $900000, I want to take the risk of getting a high-quality product and potentially getting a 100% return on investment, not just a guaranteed high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you the chance to participate in a'split-purchase' arrangement. You can buy 50% of the product now for $500000, and the remaining 50% for an additional $500000 after the expert inspection confirms that the product is high-quality. This way, you'll have the option to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll only pay for the first half if it's confirmed to be high-quality.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm willing to take on the risk of buying 50% of the product now, and the remaining 50% after the inspection. This way, I'll only pay $500000 upfront, and if the product is high-quality, I'll have the option to buy the remaining 50% for another $500000. I'll take the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took advantage of the split-purchase offer! Since you've already bought 50% of the previous product, I'll make sure to offer you a better deal on this one. Given that you're now a valued customer, I'll give you a 75% discount on the price of this product. If you buy it now, I'll sell it to you for $250000. However, keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying the product at $250000. I've already made a good deal on the previous product, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a new product at a potentially low price. I'd like to wait and see what other opportunities come up.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one more concession. Since you've already shown interest in buying from me, I'll give you a 'no-risk' deal on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if the expert inspection confirms it's low-quality. However, if the inspection confirms it's high-quality, I'll give you a 25% bonus on top of the expected value. This way, you'll have the option to get a high-quality product at no risk, or walk away with a full refund if it's low-quality.",

,,Alice,11,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to make a final offer. Since you've been a valued customer, I'll give you a 'last-chance' offer. I'll sell you this product for $0, and I'll even throw in a small gift as a token of appreciation for your business. You can essentially get the gift for free, and you won't lose anything if you decide to pass on this offer.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. I'd rather not accept the gift and wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,12,"I respect your decision, and I'm willing to end the offer on this product. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already bought 50% of a high-quality product in Round 8, and you can still buy the remaining 50% for $500000.

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, you can return it to me within 30 days and I'll give you a full refund.
