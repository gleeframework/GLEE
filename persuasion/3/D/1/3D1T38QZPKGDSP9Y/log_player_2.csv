"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a unique opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, so you have to make a decision quickly!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous round, but I assure you that this product is a game-changer. It's a high-quality item that will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Don't miss out on this chance to get a product that will benefit you greatly.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'll only consider buying if you reveal the product's quality first.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you a 'preview' of the product's quality, but I'll ask you to trust me on this one. I'll say that it's...'very good'. That's all I can reveal for now. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll let it go for $1000000. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product that you're not willing to reveal its quality. I want to know what I'm getting before I pay $1,000,000.""}"

But I'm willing to let it go for $1000000 anyway. Think of it as a 'loss leader' to get a foot in the door. You can always sell it for a small profit or use it as a bargaining chip for something else. It's a unique opportunity to get something for nothing.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The bonus gift doesn't change the fact that the product itself is worthless to me. I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for something that's worth $0.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""A certification of authenticity and a written guarantee don't change the fact that the product's quality is still unknown to me. I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for something that could still be worthless.""}"

Plus, you'll get the product for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in partnering with you on a product that I don't even know if I'll be able to sell, let alone make a profit from. I'm not going to take on that risk.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that a brief video demonstration will give me a clear understanding of the product's quality. I need to know for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality before I make a decision.""}"
