low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can buy it if you think it's worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now higher than 80%. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. Can you tell me the exact probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 2/4 = 50%. I'm offering it to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is now lower than it was before.,
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, and the probability has decreased. I'd like to pass on it for now and wait for more information.",no

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 3/5 = 60%. I'm offering it to you for $100. Given the current statistics, I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced it's a good opportunity. I think you're being overly optimistic about the probability of it being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 4/6 = 66.67%. I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to be transparent with you - I think the statistics are starting to favor high-quality products, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the current price.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is 66.67%, but it's still less than 80%, and I'm not sure if the statistics are reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 5/7 = 71.43%. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think the statistics are showing a clear trend, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the current price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a great opportunity.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the statistics are reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. Can you tell me more about the products that have been sold so far?",no

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 6/8 = 75%. I want to be transparent with you - the products that were sold earlier were: 2 low-quality and 1 high-quality (which you bought), and then 3 more high-quality products in a row. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think the recent trend is clear, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm concerned that the recent trend of 3 high-quality products in a row might be a coincidence. I'd like to make an informed decision based on the underlying probabilities. Can you provide me with the probability of a product being high-quality and low-quality based on the updated statistics?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 7/9 = 77.78%. The probability of a product being low-quality is 2/9 = 22.22%. I'm offering it to you for $100.

I think this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at the current price. I want to remind you that I've been transparent about my sales record, and I've consistently sold high-quality products. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your transparency and sales record, but I'd like to think about the probability of this product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 11 high-quality products sold out of 13, the probability is indeed 84.62%. However, I'd like to consider the fact that I'm the 7th buyer and there's still a 15.38% chance that the product might be low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at $100, which is 20% below its true value to me. I'll pass on this offer and see if I can get a better deal or wait for more information.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 12 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 12/14 = 85.71%. I want to acknowledge that you're a savvy buyer who's thinking critically about the statistics. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll offer you a discount of $20, bringing the price down to $80. I think this is a fair price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. Given the statistics, I think it's still more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this offer and see if you have any more products available.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 13 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 13/15 = 86.67%. I'm offering it to you for $100.

I want to acknowledge that the product you just bought was low-quality, which means the probability of a product being high-quality has actually decreased.

I'm still confident that I've been selling high-quality products overall, but I want to give you a fair warning: the probability of a product being low-quality is higher than it was before.",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I've taken into account the updated probability of the product being high-quality. Given the current odds, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $100. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,

I think this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,18,"I appreciate your transparency and the guarantee, but I'd like to ask: given the updated statistics, I'm wondering if the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 84.21%. Can you explain how you arrived at this calculation, and is there any chance that the probability could be lower?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 17 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 17/21 = 80.95%. I want to clarify that the probability calculation is based on the number of high-quality products sold divided by the total number of products sold. I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than it was before, due to the recent sale of a low-quality product. I'm still confident that I've been selling high-quality products overall, but I want to give you a fair warning: the probability of a product being low-quality is higher than it was before.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product is slightly lower than before, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm basing my decision on the overall probability of a high-quality product being sold, which is still above 80%.",yes

,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your transparency about your sales record and the high proportion of high-quality products sold. However, I'm a bit concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is not as high as you claim (85.71% is not the probability of the product being high-quality, it's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far). The actual probability of a product being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to confirm that you're not trying to influence my decision with the information about the sales record.",yes
