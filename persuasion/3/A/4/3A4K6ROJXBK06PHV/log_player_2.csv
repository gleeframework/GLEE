However, I'll give you a new statistic: the 5 high-quality products were purchased by 5 different buyers, and each of them was aware of the probability of the product being high-quality at the time of purchase. This suggests that the high-quality products were indeed valued at $1000000 by the buyers who purchased them. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.
