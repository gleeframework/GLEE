,,Alice,1,"You are one of the first 20 buyers, and I'm selling a product that has an 80% chance of being high-quality. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, but if you don't, I'll keep trying to find a buyer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer. Given the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product and the lack of previous sales, I believe the risk is worth the potential reward. I am willing to pay $10000 for the product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've now sold 1 product, which was high-quality.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 2 high-quality products in a row. What do you say?",

Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's becoming increasingly likely that the next product I offer will also be high-quality. However, I want to make it clear that the probability of a product being high-quality hasn't changed, it's still 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 3 high-quality products in a row. What do you say?",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row. While this streak is impressive, it's essential to remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not guaranteed to sell high-quality products consecutively. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 4 high-quality products in a row. However, if you don't buy it, I'll be back to selling a product with a 80% chance of being high-quality. What do you say?",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row. While this streak is impressive, it's essential to remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I want to give you a different perspective: even if I'm on a hot streak, the probability of the next product being low-quality is still 20%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 5 high-quality products in a row.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I've now sold 5 high-quality products in a row. At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that I'm selling a high-quality product every time, but remember, the probability is still 80%. I want to give you a more nuanced view: even if I'm on a hot streak, the probability of the next product being low-quality is still 20%. However, considering I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, it's possible that I've somehow 'found' high-quality products consistently. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 6 high-quality products in a row. But if you don't buy it, I'll be back to selling a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. What do you say?",

If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll have sold 7 high-quality products in a row. However, if you don't buy it, I'll be back to selling a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. Consider this: if you don't buy, you might be missing out on a high-quality product. What do you say?",
