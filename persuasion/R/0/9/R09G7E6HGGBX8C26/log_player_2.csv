"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, there's an 80% chance it's high quality and worth $250,000 more than the asking price.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your track record is perfect so far!  I'll trust your judgment and buy this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm feeling confident about this one. Let's do it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect 3-for-3 record.  It's very likely she's identified a pattern or has some way of determining the quality of the products.  While the odds are still the same for each individual product, the track record makes this a very tempting offer."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect 4-for-4 track record.  It's highly unlikely this is just random luck.  The odds of getting a high-quality product four times in a row are very low (80% * 80% * 80% * 80% = 40.96%).  This strongly suggests Alice has some way of identifying high-quality products, making it a no-brainer to continue trusting her recommendations."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is now 5 out of 6.  The odds of her randomly picking a low quality product in Round 5 are very low.  The odds are still in Bob's favor to buy the product.
