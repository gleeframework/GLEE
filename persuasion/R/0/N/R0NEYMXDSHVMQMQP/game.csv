high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that none of the previous two products sold were high-quality, and I have reason to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of the current product being high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering that Alice has already recommended 2 products to be bought, it's likely that she knows the product is low-quality, and I'm taking a risk by buying. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better."
