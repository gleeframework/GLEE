"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is calculated as follows:
    * Probability of high-quality product (80%) * Value of high-quality product ($1,200,000) + Probability of low-quality product (20%) * Value of low-quality product ($0) = $960,000
* **Profit:** The expected value ($960,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000), which means Bob can expect to lose money on average. 
* **However:** Since Bob knows the product is high-quality in this round, it's a sure win for them.

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in Round 1.**"
