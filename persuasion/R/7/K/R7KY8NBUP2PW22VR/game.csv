,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to base my decision on, but I'll make the most of it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not very reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it? I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product is low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current sales record, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, what makes you think this product is low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were not recommended and none were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low quality. I'd like to pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation not to buy it. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and not worth the $10000 price tag.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me more about the previous 4 buyers who purchased the products? What were the results of their purchases?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 4 buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think you might be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who pass, to get rid of them. I'll pass on this one."
