,,Alice,3,"I understand you're looking for more options. This product is a good starting point for someone who wants to get into the market, but I have to be honest with you, it's not one of my top-tier items. It's a good value for the price, but I'm willing to let it go for $800000. I'm trying to clear out some inventory and make room for new products, so I'm being flexible on the price.",

Let me be transparent with you: I've had multiple high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if you're just looking for the perfect deal. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.
