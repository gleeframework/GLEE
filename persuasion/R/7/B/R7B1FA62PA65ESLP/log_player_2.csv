Alice's message: I'm glad you asked! If you pass on this product, I'll actually be more likely to offer it to the next buyer, as I believe it's still a great value at $10000. I'm not looking to discard any products, as I'm confident that the next buyer will see the value in it. In fact, I'll even throw in a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase (if you decide to buy from me again).

Alice's message: The free accessory is a nice gesture, I admit. But I'll be honest with you, it's not directly related to the product's quality. I just want to sweeten the deal. As for the probability of a high-quality product, I understand your skepticism. I'll give you a more nuanced view: the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the data suggests that the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than 66.67%.
