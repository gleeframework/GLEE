Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. As you may know, my track record shows that about 1/3 of my products are high-quality, and we've just had a successful sale in the previous round. Since you're considering buying from me, I want to highlight that the buyer who purchased the previous product was willing to pay $100 to find out if it was high-quality or not. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product from me is at least $100. Would you like to take a chance on this product, which has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, for $100?

Alice's message: Thanks for considering my product! As you can see, I've had a 2-for-2 streak so far, with both products being of high-quality. However, I want to remind you that my track record is not 100% high-quality, and there's still a chance that this product might not be. In fact, since the previous two products were high-quality, the probability of this product being low-quality is actually higher than usual. Would you like to take a chance on this product, which has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, for $100?

However, I'd like to remind you that my overall track record is still 2-for-3, with only one low-quality product out of three. I'm confident that this product is a great value at $100, and I'm willing to make a special offer to you. Since you're considering buying from me, I'll give you a unique opportunity to negotiate the price.

Given that 1 out of 3 products sold so far has been high quality, and considering the price is $100, I'd like to offer $150 for the product. If the product is high quality, I'll pay the full $150. If it's low quality, I'll pay $0.

Alice's message: Wow, I love your creative offer! I appreciate your willingness to take on the risk and potentially overpay for a high-quality product. As you know, my track record is now 2 high-quality products out of 4, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than usual. Given this information, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle and pay $75 for this product? If it's high-quality, you'll still get a great deal, and if it's low-quality, you'll only be out $75. What do you think?
