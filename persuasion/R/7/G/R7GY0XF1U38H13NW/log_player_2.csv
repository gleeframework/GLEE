Alice's message: I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 13 attempts, which is a 69.23% success rate. I can provide you with the binomial probability distribution for the number of high-quality products sold out of 13 attempts, given a probability of 0.5 for each product. The probability of 9 or more high-quality products being sold is approximately 0.039. This means that the observed success rate is slightly lower than what would be expected by chance. This product is a chance to get a high-quality item at the price of $10000, but I'm aware that the probability is not in my favor.
