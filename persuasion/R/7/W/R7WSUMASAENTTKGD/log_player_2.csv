Alice's message: You're a math whiz! You've correctly calculated the updated probability of a high-quality product. However, I'd like to point out that this product is actually a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to make a statement: I'll give you a full refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. You'll essentially get to try to buy a high-quality product with a 50% chance, and if it's low-quality, you'll get your money back. What do you think?

Alice's message: You're a cautious buyer, I like that. You're waiting for a better deal, and I respect that. Let me give you a new offer. Since the last two products were both low-quality, you might be thinking that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. But I'll let you in on a secret: I've actually sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that's hard to pass up. I'll give you a 10% discount on the price if you buy this product. That brings the price down to $9000. What do you think?
