I know it's not high-quality, but I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10,000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discount, and who knows, you might even find a use for it.

You're essentially getting a product that's worth $0 to you, but you're paying only $10,000 for it. That's a 100% discount! It's a great opportunity to get something for nothing. What do you think?
