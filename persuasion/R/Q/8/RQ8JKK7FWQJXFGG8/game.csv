high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is unknown and I'll find out after the purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%, which is much higher than the true probability of 80%. I think this is an anomaly and I'd rather wait for more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a purchase.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation was given after only 2 previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
