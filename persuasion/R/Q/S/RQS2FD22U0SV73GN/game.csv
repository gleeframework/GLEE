low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyer, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's decision before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it. This might indicate that the product is more likely to be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to ask, what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the products offered so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality. With 5 failed attempts and no high-quality products sold, I'm guessing that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm not relying on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I'm starting to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy it despite your recommendation, because I think you're trying to discourage me to buy a low-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall average, so I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's because of the recommendation or the fact that I'm the 8th buyer. Can you explain your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if your previous recommendations are reliable. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending the product?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it, which makes me think it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your past recommendations have not been favorable."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 10 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather not take the risk."
