low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior information to go off of. I'm willing to take the risk of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the true quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased significantly, and I might get lucky."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high number of low-quality products that must have been sold so far, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, given the low success rate of high-quality products so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my perception of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me suggests it might be a low-quality product, given that none of the previous three products were high-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're being overly cautious in your recommendations. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality. I'm willing to take that risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 buyers have not found the product to be worth buying, and since Alice does not recommend it, I will pass on it as well. I would like to know the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests the product is likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000 and not waste my chance to buy a high-quality product for $4000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that she has no reason to recommend it, implying that it might be low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'll take the risk and hope for the best!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it less than 0?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the probability of a high-quality product being offered."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm going to assume that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from someone else or pass on the product."
