Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,13,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the high probability of receiving a high-quality product (83.3%) and considering the value ($400) if it turns out to be high quality, I am willing to purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
