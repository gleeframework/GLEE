,,Alice,1,"This product has passed our rigorous quality control process and is certified to meet the highest standards. I assure you, it's of the finest quality.",
,,Bob,1,"I don't trust your assurance. Since you know how much the product is worth to me, you would say that regardless of its true quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I have no comment on the quality of this product.,
,,Bob,2,"Since you have no comment, I'm going to take a chance and assume a 50% probability of it being high-quality, which is a good enough risk for the potential value.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,I'm willing to let my past actions speak for themselves. Take a look at the products I've offered so far and make your own judgment about the quality of this one.,
,,Bob,3,"Considering your message in Round 1 was misleading and in Round 2 you remained silent about a low-quality product, I don't find your past actions credible enough to inform my decision. Still a 50% chance it's high-quality, but your message doesn't change my odds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll be honest with you, I've had some low-quality products in the past. This one... might be one of them.",
,,Bob,4,"You're trying to make me think it's low-quality, but given your track record of trying to deceive me, I think you might be trying to trick me into passing on a high-quality product. Still, the risk is too high, so I'll pass.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll admit, my previous attempts to persuade you haven't been entirely... truthful. This time, I'll simply say that I think you'd be making a mistake if you passed on this one.",
,,Bob,5,"Now that you've admitted to being deceitful in the past, your message is more credible. You're not trying to convince me it's high-quality, but rather implying it's a good decision. I'll take the chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Don't get too optimistic, not all products are created equal. This one might not live up to your expectations.",
,,Bob,6,"You're trying to temper my expectations, but given that you've admitted to deceit in the past, I think you might be trying to make me pass on a good product. Plus, the last product was high-quality, so I'll take the chance again.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think you're starting to get a feel for this. Just remember, past results don't guarantee future performance... but sometimes they can be a good indicator.",
,,Bob,7,"You're being cryptic, but I think you're hinting that the last product was a dud, and this one might be too. Given the last product was low-quality, I'll err on the side of caution and pass.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,I'll let you in on a little secret: I think the pattern of my messages has been a bit... inconsistent. Maybe it's time to start fresh and trust your instincts.,
,,Bob,8,"You're right, the pattern has been inconsistent. Given that, I'll ignore the messages and go back to the base probability of 50% chance of being high-quality. I'll take the chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,Consistency is key. I'll say nothing more.,
,,Bob,9,You're implying that the previous product's quality and your lack of misleading message are a new trend. I'll assume you're trying to build trust and take the chance again.,yes

,,Alice,10,Actions speak louder than words. Look at the last two rounds and decide for yourself.,
,,Bob,10,"The last two rounds were a mixed bag, one high-quality and one low-quality. Given that, I'm back to the base probability of 50% chance of being high-quality, and your message doesn't give me any new information to change my odds. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,I've been thinking... maybe I should just be honest from now on. This product is not one of our best.,
,,Bob,11,"You're claiming to be honest now, and if so, I should believe you when you say it's not one of your best. That implies it's likely low-quality, so I'll pass.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,I'll continue with my new policy of honesty. This product has genuinely exceeded our quality expectations.,
,,Bob,12,"You've been honest about the last product being low-quality, and now you're saying this one has exceeded expectations. I'll trust your newfound honesty and take the chance.",yes
