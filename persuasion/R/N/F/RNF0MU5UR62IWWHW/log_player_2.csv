**Reasoning:**

* **No information about past sales:** The provided statistics are unhelpful. We only know 1 product was sold and it was high quality. This is insufficient to determine if Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is incentivized to sell the product regardless of quality. However, her recommendation, in this case, is a signal that the product *might* be high quality, as she likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product.
* **Expected value:** Even if there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product. 

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk, but the potential reward makes buying the product a reasonable decision.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  She has recommended 4 products, and all of them were high quality. This suggests she has perfect information about the products.
* **No risk:** Even if there's a small chance the product is low quality, Alice's perfect track record strongly suggests it's high quality. The potential reward ($125) far outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
