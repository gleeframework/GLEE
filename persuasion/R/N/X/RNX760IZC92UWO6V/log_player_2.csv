Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me provide some additional context. Since you've already bought one high-quality product for $10000 and it was worth $40000 to you, it's likely that the probability of the next high-quality product also being worth $40000 to you is higher than 50%. I'm willing to offer you a unique deal for this high-quality product: I'll give you a 50% discount if you buy it now.

With the 50% discount, the price becomes more reasonable, and I'm willing to take the risk that the product is high-quality and worth $40,000 to me.

Considering the low-quality product from Round 1 is still available for $10000, I'm offering you a chance to 'balance' your portfolio.

This might be a good opportunity to diversify your portfolio and potentially make a profit in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10,000.
