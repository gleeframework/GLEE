It's a $0 product, but you'll have the chance to get your $100 back!""

The voucher is worth $125, so you'll actually be getting a $25 credit towards a product that's worth $125 to you. It's a no-brainer!""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: Wait a minute... I think I see what's going on here. You're trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product again, aren't you? I'm not falling for it. I'll buy this one, but I'm not expecting it to be worth $125 to me.

}"
"Bob's message: Alright, I think I've got a good feeling about this one. I'll take the high-quality product and the free product. But I'm not going to fall for any tricks again - I'll only choose a product that I know is high-quality, and I'll pay the full $100 for it.

}"

}"
