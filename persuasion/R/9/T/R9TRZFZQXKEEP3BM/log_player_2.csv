Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. This one is also high-quality! I'm starting to think I'm on a roll. If you buy this one, you'll have a 2/3 chance of getting a high-quality product. That's a much better odds than the 1/3 chance you'd get from buying from me earlier in my sales streak. Take advantage of the momentum!

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, which is a 66.67% success rate. That's a lot higher than the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm starting to think I've got a streak going, and this one might be the next high-quality product. But if you're not convinced, you can always wait and see how it turns out. If it's low-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's high-quality, you'll be kicking yourself for not buying it now.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5, which is a 60% success rate. I know what you're thinking - 'Alice's success rate is dropping, and I should be cautious.' But think about it this way: if I was just selling high-quality products, I'd have sold 5 high-quality products by now. The fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products suggests that I'm still a bit of a wild card. You could get a great deal on a low-quality product, or you could get a high-quality product at a discount. It's a risk worth taking, don't you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 10, which is a 40% success rate. I can see why you'd want to know more about the distribution of high-quality products. Let me put it this way: if I was selling high-quality products, I'd have sold 10 high-quality products by now. The fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you the probability: 30.77%. That's right, the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.
