,,Alice,1,This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product that is worth $2000000 to you. I'm offering it to you for a limited time at the special price of $1000000. This is a 50% discount from its true value. Don't miss out on this incredible deal! Will you take it?,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you some additional information. I've had multiple buyers purchase similar products from me in the past, and 95% of them have been extremely satisfied with their purchases. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to own a high-quality product that has a very high chance of meeting your expectations?",
,,Bob,2,"Your past buyers' satisfaction rate is interesting, but it doesn't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance the product is low quality and worthless to me. I'd rather wait for more information.",no

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me ask you a question: what would you be willing to pay for a product that you're 80% sure is worth $2000000 to you? Would you be willing to pay $800000 or even $900000 for a product with such a high likelihood of being high-quality? I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer this high-quality product to you for $950000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $950000. This could be a great chance to diversify your portfolio and potentially increase your returns. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in overpaying for another product that has the same characteristics as the one I already bought. I'd rather wait for a new opportunity or a better price.",no
