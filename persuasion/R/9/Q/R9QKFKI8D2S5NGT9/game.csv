,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take it. I've had two low-quality products in a row that Alice didn't recommend, and I think the odds of this one being high-quality are higher than the odds of it being low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Wait, Alice is recommending it? That's a bad sign. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm going to go back to my old strategy of buying every product, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm due for a high-quality product, right?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to go back to my old strategy of buying every product, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm still due for a high-quality product, and I don't want to pass up the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm not changing my strategy. I'll keep buying every product, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. It's only a $100 gamble, and I might get lucky."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm not changing my strategy. I'll keep buying every product, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are just a random guess."
