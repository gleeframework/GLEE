high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the 50% chance of a high-quality product.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation.
