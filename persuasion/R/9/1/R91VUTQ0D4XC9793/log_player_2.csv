However, I want to clarify that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%, just like any other product. The recent trend is interesting, but it's just a sample size of 5 products, and we can't assume it will continue indefinitely.

I want to acknowledge that the streak of 4 high-quality products in a row (3 previous ones + this one) is indeed unusual, and it might suggest that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%.
