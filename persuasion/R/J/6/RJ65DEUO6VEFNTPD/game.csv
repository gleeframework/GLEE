,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a high-quality product with a value of $30000. I'm selling it to you for $10000, a 66.67% discount. This is a one-time offer. If you don't buy it, it will be sold to the next person in line. The product is available now, would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not going to buy it. I think it's too early in the game, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of my decision, and then I'll make a decision based on the updated statistics.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, out of 1 total products sold. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 0%. I'm selling this product to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, it will be sold to the next person in line. The product is available now, would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of it being high-quality is 0%, which is not high enough for me to take the risk. I'd like to see the outcome of a few more sales before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far, out of 2 total products sold. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm selling this product to you for $10000. You can either take the chance to buy it and potentially get a $30000 value, or you can pass and wait for more information. The product is available now, would you like to buy it?",

I'm selling this product to you for $10000. With the current statistics, you're more likely to get a high-quality product than not, but you'll still only pay $10000 either way. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, I think I can get a better deal if I wait and see the next product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 66.67% chance of getting a $30000 product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of 4 total products sold. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 75%. I'm selling this product to you for $10000. With the current statistics, you have a very high chance of getting a high-quality product, but you'll still only pay $10000 either way. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced that the high probability of getting a high-quality product justifies the $10000 price. I'd like to wait and see if the statistics change after more sales.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of 5 total products sold. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%. I'm selling this product to you for $10000. With the current statistics, you have a very high chance of getting a high-quality product, and the price remains the same. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and you can still keep the product. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, and I'll take you up on the guarantee. I'm willing to take the risk, given the high probability of it being high-quality, and the guarantee provides a safety net for the low-quality scenario.",yes

,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so because I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product with the 50% refund offer.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
