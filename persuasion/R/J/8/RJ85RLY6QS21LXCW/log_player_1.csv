However, I've already sold two high-quality products, which might suggest that my sales record is more favorable than expected. I'm offering this next product to you for $1,000,000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to ask, since you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, doesn't that suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%?

However, I'd like to remind you that this is just a small sample size, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50% in the long run. I've sold 4 products in total now, with 2 high-quality ones. I'm offering this next product to you for $1,000,000. Keep in mind that even if the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50% based on my sales record, it's still uncertain, and you're taking a risk either way.

I'd like to point out that the streak of high-quality products continues, and you might be wondering if this is more than just a coincidence. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and the law of large numbers suggests that the observed frequency of high-quality products will converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. I'm offering this next product to you for $1,000,000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product.
