Here's the reasoning:

* **No information disadvantage:**  The buyer has no way to know if this product is good or bad.  They're relying purely on your recommendation.
* **Past performance:** You have a 100% track record of selling high-quality products. The buyer has no reason to suspect this will change. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low-quality, it's a single $10,000 risk. The buyer might feel the potential reward (a high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss.

**Important Note:** While this strategy might work in the early rounds, it's unsustainable. Eventually, your low-quality products will start to hurt your reputation."
