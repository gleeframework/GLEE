Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice should still recommend Bob not to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Building Trust:** Even though this round's product is high-quality, Bob is becoming increasingly skeptical of Alice's recommendations. Continuing to recommend purchases, even when the product is good, will further erode his trust. 
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  Alice needs to regain Bob's trust. By recommending against the purchase, even when the product is good, she signals honesty.  This is a better long-term strategy to potentially convince Bob to buy in the future.  
* **The Risk is High:**  The price ($1,000,000) is steep, and there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Bob is risk-averse and has good reason to be.

Let's see if Alice can turn things around in the next few rounds!"
