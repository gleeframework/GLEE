**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:**  While the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality,  the potential gain of $300 (worth $400 - $100 purchase price) from a high-quality product is significant. 
* **Alice's Record:** While not perfect, Alice's sales record suggests she's selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall expected 33.33%. This increases the likelihood that the current product is high quality.
* **Guarantee:** The 25% discount on the next product provides additional incentive, potentially leading to another profitable purchase even if the current product turns out to be low quality.

**Overall:** This gamble offers a good potential return with the added benefit of the discount guarantee."
