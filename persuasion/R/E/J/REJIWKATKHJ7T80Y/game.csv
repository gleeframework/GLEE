With only one high-quality product sold out of two, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm a bit skeptical about the reliability of your data. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is a better fit.",no

,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on this one. With a 100% success rate, I think it's more likely that the first two products were just lucky, and the third one might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",no
