,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea since there's no data to go by. I'm doing this purely based on the odds of the product being high-quality, which is 80%."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's purchase before making a decision. Was the product they bought high-quality?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, given the 20% chance of it being worthless. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, I'm not convinced that the product I'm offered is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 80%, but the fact that the first product sold was high-quality suggests that we might be in a 'hot streak' or that the first product was just a lucky draw. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer purchased the product, it suggests that the first product was high-quality.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%, which is suspiciously high. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
