``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** Since there's no prior sales data, there's no evidence to suggest the product is likely to be high or low quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** While not perfect, Alice's recommendation carries some weight. It's in her best interest to sell products, so she likely believes this product is of good quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain ($30,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000) in this scenario.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available at this stage. As more sales data becomes available, the buyer's decision-making process should become more informed."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you Alice! I appreciate your recommendation.  Given the information available, I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the purchase, which suggests she believes the product is high-quality. While her information about quality is limited, she has a vested interest in making a sale. 
* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, the data is still quite thin.  However, the fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it turned out to be high-quality is a positive sign.
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with the 20% risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $30,000 outweighs the risk in this scenario.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided.  The optimal strategy could change with more data points or different information about Alice's recommendation process."
