Alice's message: I've sold 9 products so far, with 4 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. Given the recent trend of low-quality products, you asked for the probability of the next product being high-quality. Using Bayes' theorem, I can update the probability based on the new information.

Alice's message: You're interested in the probabilities after 10 sales. Given the initial 50% chance of a product being high-quality, and the observed results of 5 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, we can calculate the updated probabilities. The probability of a product being high-quality after 10 sales is approximately 50.00% (5 high-quality products out of 10 total products), and the probability of a product being low-quality after 10 sales is also approximately 50.00% (5 low-quality products out of 10 total products).

Alice's message: You're interested in the distribution of the high-quality products. I can tell you that the high-quality products are not randomly distributed throughout the sales.
