```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk. Since Alice knows the quality and recommends buying, it increases the likelihood of the product being high-quality.  Furthermore, the data shows that the previously sold product was high-quality, further supporting a positive outlook."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a vested interest in you buying the product. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation adds valuable information.  
* **Previous sales data:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of two total sales suggests a higher than average chance of the current product also being high quality. 

While there's still a risk, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the slightly better-than-average sales data makes buying the product the more logical decision."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 4 high-quality products out of 5 sold, the success rate is 80%. This aligns perfectly with the overall probability of a product being high quality (80%). 
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of each product and has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality ones to ensure buyers return. 
* **Potential Profit:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($2,500) outweighs the risk."

**Reasoning:**

The data shows a very high success rate of high-quality products being sold (13/15 = 86.7%). This is significantly higher than the overall 80% chance of a product being high quality.  While Alice does know the quality of the product, her recommendation strongly suggests it's likely to be high quality, making it a good risk."
