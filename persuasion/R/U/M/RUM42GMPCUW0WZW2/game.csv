high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, it suggests a very high probability of a high-quality product being offered to me.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 total sales, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very high, but I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, but I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
