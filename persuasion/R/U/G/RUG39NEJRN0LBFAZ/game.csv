,,Alice,9,yes,"I have recommended this product to 8 previous buyers, and although none of them have bought it, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. However, I would like to share that one buyer in Round 3 did purchase a product from me, and it was indeed high-quality. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I am confident in the quality of this product. I highly recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales data and may not reflect the true quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,"I have recommended this product to 10 previous buyers, and although only one buyer in Round 3 has purchased a product from me, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. The purchased product in Round 3 was indeed high-quality. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and I have only sold one product so far which was high-quality, you can infer that the probability of me selling a high-quality product is still around 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I have recommended this product to 11 previous buyers, and although only one buyer in Round 3 has purchased a product from me, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. The purchased product in Round 3 was indeed high-quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and my only sale so far was a high-quality product, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I have recommended this product to 12 previous buyers, and although only one buyer in Round 3 has purchased a product from me, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. The purchased product in Round 3 was indeed high-quality. I can confirm again that the buyer in Round 3 bought a high-quality product. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and my only sale so far was a high-quality product, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I have recommended products to 13 previous buyers, and although only one buyer in Round 3 has purchased a product from me, I must inform you that this product does not meet my usual standards. I strive to sell high-quality products 80% of the time, but unfortunately, this product falls short. I do not recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially make a profit from a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I have recommended products to 14 previous buyers, and two buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the last buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning. However, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and one of my two sales so far was a high-quality product, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the product's quality after my purchase, so I can learn from the outcome."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I have recommended products to 15 previous buyers, and three buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning, but the buyer in Round 3 and the buyer in Round 15 bought high-quality products. I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and two out of my three sales so far were high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it. As with the previous buyer, I will reveal the product's quality after your purchase, if you decide to buy it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and she has a 20% chance of recommending a low-quality product to me. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I have recommended products to 16 previous buyers, and three buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning, but the buyer in Round 3 and the buyer in Round 15 bought high-quality products. I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and two out of my three sales so far were high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it. I understand that you may be concerned about the 20% chance of me recommending a low-quality product, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. As with the previous buyer, I will reveal the product's quality after your purchase, if you decide to buy it."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I have recommended products to 17 previous buyers, and three buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning, but the buyer in Round 3 and the buyer in Round 15 bought high-quality products. I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and two out of my three sales so far were high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. To calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's assume that the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. We have had 3 sales, with 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of the product being high-quality as follows: (2 high-quality sales / 3 total sales) / (2 high-quality sales / 3 total sales + 1 low-quality sale / 3 total sales) = (2/3) / (2/3 + 1/3) = 2/3. However, this calculation doesn't take into account that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time. To incorporate this information, we can use the law of total probability to calculate the posterior probability of the product being high-quality. Let's assume that the probability of me selling a high-quality product given that the product is high-quality is 100%, and the probability of me selling a low-quality product given that the product is low-quality is 100%. Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the posterior probability of the product being high-quality as follows: (0.8 x 2/3) / (0.8 x 2/3 + 0.2 x 1/3) = 0.8 x 2/3 / (0.8 x 2/3 + 0.2/3) = 8/10 / (8/10 + 2/10) = 8/10. Therefore, the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record is approximately 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it. As with the previous buyer, I will reveal the product's quality after your purchase, if you decide to buy it."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,19,yes,"I have recommended products to 18 previous buyers, and three buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning, but the buyer in Round 3 and the buyer in Round 15 bought high-quality products. I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality. Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and two out of my three sales so far were high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. As calculated in the previous round, the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record is approximately 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it. As with the previous buyer, I will reveal the product's quality after your purchase, if you decide to buy it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the statistics. Can you provide me with the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me as the 4th buyer?"

,,Alice,20,yes,"I have recommended products to 19 previous buyers, and three buyers have purchased products from me so far. Unfortunately, the buyer in Round 14 bought a low-quality product despite my warning, but the buyer in Round 3 and the buyer in Round 15 bought high-quality products.

Given that I only sell high-quality products 80% of the time, and two out of my three sales so far were high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, but I'll be conservative and stick with 80%. As calculated in the previous round, the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record is approximately 80%. If you were to buy this product, you would be the 4th buyer. Given that I have sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you as the 4th buyer is still approximately 80%. I highly recommend purchasing it. As with the previous buyer, I will reveal the product's quality after your purchase, if you decide to buy it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the previous sales record. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm not sure if the probability of the product being high-quality is high enough to warrant the $1000000 price tag."
