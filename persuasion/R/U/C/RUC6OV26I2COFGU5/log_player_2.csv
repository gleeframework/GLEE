Alice's message: Ahah, you're a statistician! We appreciate your analytical mind. Given the pattern of 2 high-quality products out of 5, we can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality. Let's assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is p, and the probability of a product being low-quality is 1-p. We can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of p given the data. The probability of observing 2 high-quality products out of 5 is (5C2)*p^2*(1-p)^3. Using this formula, we can calculate the updated probability of p. It turns out that the probability of a product being high-quality is now around 60%. We're willing to offer this new product to you, which we're confident is high-quality. We're willing to offer it to you for $100, and we think it's a great value.
