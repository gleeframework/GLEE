**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one prior sale, the data is very limited. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite not knowing the true value to the buyer, is recommending purchase. This suggests she has some confidence in the product's quality.
* **Potential Upside:**  Even with a high chance of low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($12,500). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario, given the limited information. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the provided information. In a real scenario, more data and factors would be needed to make a more informed decision."
