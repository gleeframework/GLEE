**Explanation:**

* **Perfect track record:** Alice has recommended 6 products, all of which were high quality. This suggests she is perfectly capable of identifying high-quality products.
* **High potential value:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), it's still worth taking the risk because a high-quality product (80% chance) would provide a significant profit.
* **Limited supply:** Since the product is discarded if not bought, there is a potential opportunity cost of passing on the product. 

Given the information provided, the decision to buy seems to be the best option."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Sales Record:** 7 out of 7 products sold so far have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is much higher than the expected 80% probability of high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is always a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the high success rate in the sales record suggests that Alice is likely offering high-quality products. The potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product given the information available."
