"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you have no information about the buyer's valuation of the product. You know it's high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  

Since the price is fixed and the buyer can't assess the product before buying, the decision should be based on the expected value of the product.  The buyer has a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth an unknown amount. This chance is sufficient to justify buying the product, especially since there's no risk of losing more than the fixed price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but since there's no sales history yet, I'd prefer to pass on this one. I'm not comfortable buying a product without any data to back up the recommendation.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is low-quality. While you can't know exactly what the buyer values, you can be sure that a low-quality product is unlikely to be worth $10,000 to them. Recommending the purchase would be dishonest and likely harm your future sales as the buyer will learn the product was low-quality. It's better to wait for a high-quality product to build trust and a reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no track record yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the previous two buyers passed, the situation hasn't changed significantly.  You still know the product is high-quality. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%, and there's still no information about the product itself.  

It's still a calculated risk for the buyer, but the potential reward of a high-quality product at a fixed price outweighs the risk of a low-quality product.  You should continue to recommend the product as it's your best chance of making a sale."
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the recommendation, but without any prior sales data to base my decision on, I'm not comfortable purchasing at this time. I'd like to see how the quality of the products turns out for future buyers before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

It's better to be upfront about the quality and wait for a high-quality product to build trust and a reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'll pass on this product.  Since there's no sales history yet and you're not recommending it, I'm going to wait for more data.

"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any data on the quality of your products.
