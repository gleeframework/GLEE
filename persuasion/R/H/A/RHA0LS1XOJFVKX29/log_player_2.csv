**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice is recommending the purchase, which is valuable information.
* **The data:** We know that out of 1 previous buyer, 1 high-quality product was sold. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. 
* **The potential gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 price), while the potential loss is $10,000.

Considering the recommendation and the positive sales record, the risk-reward ratio seems favorable. It's worth taking a chance on this product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that she is accurately assessing the quality of her products.
* **High Potential Value:**  Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $40,000 from a high-quality product far outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 
* **Trust in Alice:**  Since Alice knows the true value of each product, her recommendation holds significant weight. 

**It's important to note:** This is a high-risk decision, but the current information suggests that the risk is worth taking."
