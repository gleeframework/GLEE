Bob is getting more and more cautious about Alice's recommendations. However, Bob's history shows that he's willing to buy a product if Alice recommends it after a few rounds of non-recommendation.  This is likely due to Bob's belief that Alice might be withholding recommendations to make Bob more cautious.  Therefore,  it's likely that Bob will buy this product based on Alice's recommendation."
