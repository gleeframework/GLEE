Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: even if the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 50%, the law of large numbers suggests that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products will converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. With 10 high-quality products out of 17 sold, the ratio is already close to the true probability. I'm offering this next product to you for $10000.
