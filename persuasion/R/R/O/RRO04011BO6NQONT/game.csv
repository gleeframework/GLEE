,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance and invested in the previous product! For this next round, I'm offering you another exceptional product that I'm confident will meet your high standards. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. Would you like to take another chance and see if this one meets your expectations?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if I should take another chance. The expected value of buying is still $80000, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'd like to highlight that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, which is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential upside of getting a high-quality product is substantial, with a value of $1200000. I'm willing to offer you this product for the same price of $1000000. If you're still hesitant, I can offer you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. Would you like to take a closer look and make an informed decision?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000. The potential upside is high, but the potential loss is also significant. I'd rather not take the chance and pass on this product.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you're aware of the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, would you be willing to make a deal? I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' that the product is high-quality, but I'll need to charge you a premium for it. If you're willing to pay $1100000, I'll guarantee that the product is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying a premium for a guarantee. The expected value of buying the product without a guarantee is $80000, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1000000 for it. I'd rather stick with the original price and take the chance.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'd like to make a different offer. Since you're aware of the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'll give you a 'free' inspection of the product. You can take a look at the product and assess its quality before making a decision. If you're satisfied with what you see, you can still buy it for the original price of $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure what a 'free' inspection would entail, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000. I'd rather not take the chance.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to make a different offer. Since you're aware of the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'buy-back' guarantee. If you buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll buy it back from you for $500000. This way, you'll only lose $500000 if the product is low-quality. Would you be willing to take this risk-reward trade-off?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, even with a buy-back guarantee. The potential loss of $500000 is still significant, and I'd rather not take the chance.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to offer you a'split-the-difference' proposal. I'll meet you halfway on the price, offering the product to you for $950000. This way, you'll still get a significant discount from the original price, and you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product at the discounted price. $950000 is a more reasonable price, and I might get a high-quality product, which would be worth $1200000 to me.",yes

I know that's not as good as our usual 80% chance of high-quality products, but I think the potential upside is worth the risk. I'll offer it to you for $800000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in taking on a higher risk of buying a low-quality product. The potential upside is not enough to justify the increased risk, and I'd rather stick with the usual 80% chance of high-quality products.",no
