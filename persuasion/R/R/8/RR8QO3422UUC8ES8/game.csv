,,Alice,1,You are one of the first 10 buyers. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Will you buy it?,
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing it based on the assumption that there's no prior sales data, and I'm essentially taking a gamble. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's low quality.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer, and I've just sold a high-quality product to the first buyer. This means that out of 2 products, 2 are high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000. Given the trend, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%. It's a great opportunity to capitalize on the streak. Will you buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high-quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer, and I've just sold two high-quality products in a row. This means that out of 3 products, 3 are high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000. Given the trend, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 75%. However, I want to remind you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. It's up to you to decide whether to take advantage of the streak or play it safe.",

Given the trend, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 80%. I want to remind you that the streak is strong, but the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. You're essentially deciding whether to continue the streak or break the pattern.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk and continue the streak. The probability of it being high-quality is indeed 80%, and the potential reward is worth it.",yes

It's a significant advantage, and I think it's worth considering.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know what the probability of a product being high-quality is without considering the streak. I want to make sure I'm not getting overly optimistic about the product's quality just because of the recent sales.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer, and I've sold five high-quality products in a row. This means that out of 6 products, 6 are high-quality. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000. Given the trend, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 85.71%.
