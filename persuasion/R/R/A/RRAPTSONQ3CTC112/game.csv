low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet, and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm taking a chance that this might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, and no high-quality products were sold. I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation, but I'll pass on this one for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more reliable signal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. Given this information, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste $100 on it. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if you recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous two buyers passed on the product, or is there something specific about the product itself that led you to recommend against it?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be trying to sell low-quality products to buyers, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, and I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the current statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests a high likelihood of it being low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I will pass on this opportunity."
