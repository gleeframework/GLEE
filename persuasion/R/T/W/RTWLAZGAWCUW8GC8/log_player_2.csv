Alice's message: You're the second buyer today, and I'm glad you're interested in this exceptional product. I've already sold one high-quality product to a previous buyer, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 80% (same as the overall probability). I have 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 total products sold so far. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a steal! What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
