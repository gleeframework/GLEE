,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to wait for more information."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 buyers and 2 sales, I've seen 0 high-quality products. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality based on this information? I'd like to make an informed decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. I'd like to know more before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on the previous sales record, and Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll take a chance and let someone else have a look."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 3 products so far, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, or she may not have any high-quality products left. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be low. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers didn't find it valuable, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far makes me think it's likely to be a low-quality product."
