I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to give you a clear picture of what you're getting. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products and received a low-quality one as a free bonus, I'm willing to throw in another low-quality product as a free bonus if you buy this one. You'll essentially be getting two low-quality products for the price of one.""
