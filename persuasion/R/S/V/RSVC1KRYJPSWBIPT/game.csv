,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go on."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing a product so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk given Alice's neutral recommendation."

,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I believe the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice might be recommending against the product because it's likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product and the statistics?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have bought the product, I'm going to pass on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on the product. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. With 2 out of 2 products being low-quality, the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than the probability of a high-quality product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
