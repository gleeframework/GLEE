low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior data, so I'm making an uninformed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I'm the second buyer, and Alice didn't recommend it, so the probability of it being low-quality is high, but I'll take a shot"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome and update my understanding of the product quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that none of the previous 3 buyers have received a high-quality product.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales records, and none of the previous 3 products were high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the lack of high-quality sales is due to a bad draw or if the products are actually low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one.
