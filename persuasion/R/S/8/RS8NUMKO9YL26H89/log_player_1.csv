Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and you'd have to take that risk.""
}"

I'll give you a 20% discount on the $100 price, making it $80. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.""

I'll offer you a'money-back guarantee' on this product. If you buy it and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100. You'll essentially be taking on no risk at all. Is that something that would make you reconsider buying the product?""
}"
"Bob's message: The money-back guarantee is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change my decision. I'm still not willing to pay $80 for a product that might be worth $0 to me, even with a guarantee. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that might not be worth anything.

I'll give you this product for $0, and I'll also throw in a small gift as a token of appreciation for taking on the risk. It's a small item that's worth around $10, but it's yours to keep regardless of the product's quality.""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I don't think trust is enough to make me take on a risk. I've seen that you've offered me low-quality products twice in a row, and I'm not willing to assume that this one will be any different. I'll pass on this offer.
