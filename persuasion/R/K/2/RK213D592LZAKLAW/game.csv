,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in checking out my products. I want to be upfront with you - this product is one of our earlier batches, and while it's still a great value, it might not be as exceptional as some of our newer items. That being said, it's still a solid product that many customers have been happy with. And at $100, it's a steal! Would you like to take a chance on it?",
