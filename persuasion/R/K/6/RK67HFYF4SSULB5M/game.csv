high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer is 100%. However, I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is 80%. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics, not the overall probability of a high-quality product being sold to any buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, as I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a purchase. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product offered. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, so I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one to see if the next product has a lower price or if the probability of it being high-quality is lower."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that information?"
