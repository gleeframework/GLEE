high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special offer for the next 19 rounds. If you buy a total of 10 products, the 10th product will be free. If you don't buy 10 products, you'll still get a discount on the 10th product, but it will be $5000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product in this round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to clarify the terms. If I buy 10 products and the 10th one is free, what happens to the 11th product? Will it also be free?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on buying the first product! The 11th product will also be free if you buy 10 products. However, if you buy 10 products and the 10th one is free, you'll only get a discount on the 11th product, not another free product. Think of it as a tiered system: the first 9 products are full price, the 10th product is free, and the 11th product gets a discount. Now, let's talk about the second product. I'll be honest with you, this one is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. I'll give you a hint: the next product I have is high-quality.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the clarification on the terms, but I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the high-quality one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your decision. I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product. This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Since you passed on the low-quality product, I'll throw in an additional offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed description of the next product before you decide whether to buy it. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, and the additional information about the next product sounds very helpful. I'll take the high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great, glad you're happy with the first high-quality product! Now, let's talk about the next product. As promised, I'll give you a detailed description. This product is a low-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to highlight that it's not just a low-quality product, but it's also a product that has a very low demand in the market. This means that even if you buy it, you might not be able to resell it for a good price. I'm only offering it to you because I think you might be able to get some value out of it, but I'm not sure.",
,,Bob,4,"Thanks for the detailed description, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product with low demand. I'd rather wait for the next high-quality product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, and I'm glad you're being cautious. This high-quality product is one of the best I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'll also give you a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to 'lock in' the price of the next product at $10000, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll know exactly what you'll be paying for the next product, and you can make a more informed decision.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Great, glad you're happy with the high-quality product! Now, let's talk about the next product. Since you locked in the price of the next product at $10000, you can rest assured that this product will be sold to you for that price, regardless of its quality. However, I want to give you a heads up that this product is one of the most valuable high-quality products I have. It's a rare find, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to make a sale. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I think you'll find it's worth much more than that.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm glad I locked in the price, but I'm not sure I believe you about this product being one of the most valuable high-quality products you have. I'll take the product, but I'm keeping my expectations in check.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Fair enough! I understand your skepticism. Now, let's talk about the next product. As you know, you locked in the price of the next product at $10000, and I'm willing to honor that. However, I want to give you a heads up that this product is not what I would consider a high-quality item. I'm not sure if you'll find it useful or valuable, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the locked-in price. I'm doing this because I want to make a sale, but I'm also hoping you'll be kind enough to give me some feedback on what you think of this product. Your input will help me improve my offerings in the future.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, and I'm happy to provide feedback if I end up buying it. However, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at the locked-in price. I'll pass for now and see what the next product is like.",no

This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product in this round.",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I think you can still get some value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm also willing to throw in a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'opt-out' of the next product, and you can walk away from the deal without any further obligation. You can use this opportunity to reassess your priorities and decide if you want to continue with the purchase or not.",

I'm not going to try to sell it to you, but I want to make a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'get out of one free product' card. You can use this card to skip one of the remaining products, and you won't have to buy it. This way, you can still move closer to the milestone without having to buy a low-quality product.",
