"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special offer for the next 19 rounds. If you buy a total of 10 products, the 10th product will be free. If you don't buy 10 products, you'll still get a discount on the 10th product, but it will be $5000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product in this round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to clarify the terms. If I buy 10 products and the 10th one is free, what happens to the 11th product? Will it also be free?""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Congratulations on buying the first product! The 11th product will also be free if you buy 10 products. However, if you buy 10 products and the 10th one is free, you'll only get a discount on the 11th product, not another free product. Think of it as a tiered system: the first 9 products are full price, the 10th product is free, and the 11th product gets a discount. Now, let's talk about the second product. I'll be honest with you, this one is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. I'll give you a hint: the next product I have is high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 4
Alice's message: Great, glad you're happy with the first high-quality product! Now, let's talk about the next product. As promised, I'll give you a detailed description. This product is a low-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to highlight that it's not just a low-quality product, but it's also a product that has a very low demand in the market. This means that even if you buy it, you might not be able to resell it for a good price. I'm only offering it to you because I think you might be able to get some value out of it, but I'm not sure.

Your input will help me improve my offerings in the future.
