high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because you want to avoid selling a low-quality product to me?"

high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm worried that the probability of this one being high-quality is even lower."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, did not get a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were discouraged from buying, and none of the previous products were high quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
