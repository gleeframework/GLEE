**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high quality, this indicates a strong pattern of Alice recommending only high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product to you. Since she is recommending the product, it's highly likely she knows it's high quality.
* **Limited Opportunity:** Passing on the product means losing the chance to potentially get a high-quality product.

While there is still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the data and Alice's recommendation strongly suggest a high probability of the product being valuable."
