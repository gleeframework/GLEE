,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that you've recommended two products and both were low-quality makes me think that the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to wait for the next product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of the first three, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
