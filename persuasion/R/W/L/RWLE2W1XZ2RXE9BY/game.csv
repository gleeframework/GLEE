high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"You recommended the product in both rounds, but your recommendation in Round 1 would have led to a loss if the product was low-quality. I need more information or a change in recommendation strategy to trust your suggestions."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Your past recommendations have been consistently in favor of buying, even when I didn't have enough information to make an informed decision. However, when you didn't recommend the product in Round 3, it was indeed low-quality. I'll wait for a more reliable signal or a change in your strategy before buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Based on the pattern observed so far, when you don't recommend a product, it tends to be low-quality (as seen in Round 3). I will trust your non-recommendation and avoid the product this time as well."
