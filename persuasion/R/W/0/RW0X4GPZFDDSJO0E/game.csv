,,Bob,3,yes,"You were correct last time, so I'll trust your recommendation again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll follow your advice, considering you correctly identified a high-quality product in Round 2 and I lost money in Round 3 when I went against the odds."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance, given that your previous recommendation in Round 2 was correct and led to a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"You've been correct on high-quality products twice before, so I'll trust your recommendation again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'll follow your advice, as your 'do not recommend' has correctly identified a low-quality product in the past, and I've lost money when I've gone against the odds on low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll follow your advice again, as it seems your 'do not recommend' has been accurate in identifying low-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'll continue to follow your advice, as it's consistently identified low-quality products when you 'do not recommend'."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I see a pattern here - every time you 'do not recommend', the product has been low-quality, so I'll trust that pattern and pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"While your recommendations haven't been 100% accurate, the potential gain of $30000 is worth the risk of losing $10000, especially since you've correctly identified high-quality products in the past."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Your last recommendation was correct, and the overall pattern suggests that your 'recommend' is more likely to be a high-quality product, so I'll take the chance again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'll follow your advice, as every time you've said 'do not recommend' so far, the product has indeed been low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing another $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"The pattern remains consistent - every 'do not recommend' has been a low-quality product, so I'll trust that pattern and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Still no reason to doubt the pattern - 'do not recommend' has always meant low-quality, so I'll avoid this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"While your recommendations haven't been 100% accurate, the potential gain is still worth the risk, and you've correctly identified high-quality products in the past, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Your last recommendation was correct, and I've had more success with your 'recommend' than not, so I'll trust your advice again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"The pattern remains consistent - every 'do not recommend' has been a low-quality product, so I'll trust that pattern and avoid this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Your 'recommend' has been correct more often than not, and the potential gain is still worth the risk, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"This is the last round, and your 'recommend' has been correct often enough that I'm willing to take the risk one more time, especially given the potential gain."
