Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a highly valuable item. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a price that I'm sure you'll agree is a steal. The item is worth much more than this to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fraction of its true value. It's a one-time offer, so you should seriously consider taking advantage of it.

Alice's message: Well, congratulations to the previous buyer, I guess. Two high-quality products out of eight total is a decent ratio, but I'm not getting too excited about it.
