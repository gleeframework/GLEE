,,Alice,17,"I love a buyer who thinks critically! I'm happy to provide you with more information. Let me tell you, the products that were discarded were a mix of low-quality and high-quality products. I've had some products that were high-quality but didn't meet my standards, and I've also had some products that were low-quality but still had some redeeming qualities. As for the distribution of high-quality products among the products that were sold, I can tell you that about 40% of the products I've sold have been high-quality, and about 60% have been low-quality.
