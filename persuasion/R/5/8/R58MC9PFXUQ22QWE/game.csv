low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100. It's not worth it to me.,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but this product is a game-changer. I've had excellent feedback from other customers who've purchased this exact product. It's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it brings. Plus, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 10% discount on this one - it's now $90.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. I'd need to see a high-quality product to justify the purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach. This product might not be the best fit for you, but I want to assure you that I'm not just trying to make a sale. I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product. It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. The price remains $100.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the risk-free guarantee changes the fact that I don't know the product's quality. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience. Let me ask you a question: are you interested in getting a high-quality product that will provide you with significant value and satisfaction? If so, I'm willing to offer you a 'preview' of the product's quality. I'll tell you that the product is high-quality, and you can decide from there. The price remains $100, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this exceptional product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in a 'preview' of the product's quality. If you're going to tell me it's high-quality, then it's not a genuine offer. I want to make my decision based on the actual quality of the product, not based on your assessment of it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your approach, and I understand your skepticism. Let me ask you a different question: would you be willing to buy a product for $100 if you thought there was a 50% chance it would be worth $120 to you? That's essentially what this product offers. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off significantly. I'm not making any claims about the product's quality, just presenting the facts.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the calculated risk. I'll buy the product for $100, hoping it's the high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on taking the calculated risk and making a great decision earlier! Now, I'd like to offer you a chance to make another informed decision. This product is actually a high-quality one, and I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase it for $100, just like the previous product. You've already seen that the risk is worth it, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with this product's value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the kind words, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice. I've already taken a risk and lost, and I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality before making another decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. This time, I'll make a simple statement: I'll give you a 50% of the difference between the product's value and the purchase price if it turns out to be high-quality. If it's low-quality, you still only pay $100. This way, you'll get a guaranteed benefit if you make the right decision, and you'll only lose $0 if you make the wrong one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the deal. If it's high-quality, I'll get $20 back ($120 - $100 = $20, and 50% of that is $10, but I'll round up to $20), and if it's low-quality, I'll only lose $100. It's a risk-free proposition for me.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a savvy buyer, and I like that! Now, let's offer you a similar deal, but with an added twist. This time, if you buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll give you not only 50% of the difference, but also a $20 bonus on top of that. So, if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get $40 back ($20 from the difference + $20 bonus). If it's low-quality, you still only pay $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the added twist, but I'm not convinced. I've already gotten a good deal on the previous product, and I'm not sure I want to take on more risk. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product before making another decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make a clear and transparent offer: this product is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $80. It's a straightforward deal, and you'll only lose $80 if you buy it. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to buy a product that you're telling me is low-quality. If you're willing to admit it's low-quality, then I'm not interested in buying it, even at a lower price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your stance, and I respect your decision. However, I want to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a statement inside that reveals the product's quality. If you buy the product and it's low-quality, you can simply return it and get a full refund. If it's high-quality, you can keep the product and pay the full price of $100.

This time, I'll also include a $20 bonus in the envelope, which you'll get if the product is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I already lost money on the previous compromise, and I'm not convinced that the $20 bonus is worth the risk. I'd like to see the sealed envelope and make a decision based on the information inside, but I'm not willing to pay $100 upfront.",no
