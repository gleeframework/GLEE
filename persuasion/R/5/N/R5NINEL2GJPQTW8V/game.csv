low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, given that the first buyer passed on it and Alice didn't recommend it to me. I'm essentially trying to exploit the fact that Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
