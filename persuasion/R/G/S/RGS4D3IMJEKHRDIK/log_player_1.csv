"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Alice is selling it for $100, it's likely to be worth more than $100 to Bob.  As a rational buyer, Bob should buy the product. However, there's no information about how much Bob values a high-quality product, so this is just a recommendation based on the given information."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We know this round's product is low-quality.  Since we don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, it's highly unlikely to be worth $100 to him. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for letting me know, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We know this round's product is low-quality. Bob already knows that the product is worth $100 to Alice.  Since Bob passed on the last product (which was also low-quality), it's safe to assume he doesn't find low-quality products to be worth $100. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We know this round's product is low-quality. Bob has shown a consistent pattern of not buying low-quality products. Even though we don't know the exact value Bob places on low-quality products, it's highly likely he won't consider this one worth $100.  It's not recommended to buy the product."
