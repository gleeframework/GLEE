"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a special deal, but I need to warn you that it's not my best product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had a lot of people pass on this one already, but I think it's a hidden gem. It's still only $100, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by including a special guarantee: if you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund... but only if you buy it now.
