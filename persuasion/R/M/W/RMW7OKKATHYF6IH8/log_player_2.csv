"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is equally likely to be high or low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to you, taking the risk is worth it.  You have a 50% chance of gaining $2,500 and a 50% chance of losing $10,000.  This is a calculated risk, and in this case, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the quality of the product, her non-recommendation indicates that the product is likely low quality. Since a low-quality product is worth nothing to you, it is not worth the $10,000 risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation reinforces the pattern from the previous round. Since she knows the quality and is not recommending the product, it's likely low quality, which is worth nothing to you. It's not worth the $10,000 risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now not recommended the product for three rounds in a row. This strengthens the pattern established in the previous rounds: she is not recommending products she knows are low quality. Given this pattern, it's best to assume this product is also low quality and pass on it, rather than risk losing $10,000."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to think there's a strategy here. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, now for four rounds in a row, strongly suggests that she's deliberately not recommending products she knows are low quality.  The risk of losing $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product, especially with this established pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice,  I'm going to pass. I'm starting to see a trend, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk on another potential low-quality product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now not recommended a product for five rounds in a row.  This pattern of behavior is extremely strong evidence that she's deliberately withholding recommendations for products she knows are low quality.  Given the potential loss of $10,000, it's far too risky to buy this product without a better reason to believe it's high quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking with my decision.  I'm not going to buy this one. I'm starting to see a clear pattern in your recommendations, and I'm not willing to take the risk on another potentially low-quality product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the fact that the product in the previous round was high quality, Alice's pattern of not recommending products for several rounds in a row remains strong. This suggests a deliberate strategy of holding back on recommendations for low-quality products. It's still too risky to buy the current product without a change in Alice's behavior."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one too. I'm still seeing the same pattern, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying a product that might be low quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though we missed out on two high-quality products in a row, Alice's consistent pattern of not recommending products for several rounds is very strong evidence that she's deliberately withholding recommendations for products she knows are low quality. The potential loss of $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product far outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product. It's best to wait for a change in Alice's behavior before considering buying another product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice,  I've seen your pattern now, and I'm not going to risk it.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Alice's lack of recommendation continues to be a consistent signal that she's withholding recommendations for low-quality products. The potential loss of $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product is too high a risk to take, even with the possibility of a high-quality product.  Until Alice shows a change in her behavior, it's best to avoid buying products she doesn't recommend."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still seeing the same pattern, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying a product that might be low quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though we missed out on another potentially high-quality product, the pattern of Alice not recommending products for several rounds in a row remains strong. This pattern has been established consistently over the last 9 rounds, and it's unlikely to change suddenly. The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is far too high, even with the possibility of a high-quality product. It's better to wait for a shift in Alice's behavior before considering buying another product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  The pattern is clear, and I'm not willing to risk buying a product that might be low quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation continues to be a strong signal that she is deliberately withholding recommendations for products she knows are low quality.  It's now been 10 rounds in a row, and the pattern is undeniable. The potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product is too high a risk to take, even with the possibility of a high-quality product. Until Alice shows a change in her behavior, it's best to avoid buying products she doesn't recommend."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm sticking to my strategy of only buying products that you recommend. I'm confident that you have a good reason for withholding your recommendation.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent pattern of not recommending products for 11 rounds in a row is now extremely strong evidence that she is deliberately withholding recommendations for low-quality products.  The risk of losing $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product is too high to take. 

This is a good opportunity to demonstrate that you've learned Alice's strategy and are adjusting your own behavior accordingly.  By sticking to your strategy of only buying products she recommends, you are showing that you understand her game and are playing to win."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still seeing the same pattern. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll stick to my strategy of only buying products you recommend.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued pattern of not recommending products reinforces the strategy you've adopted.  You've learned that she's deliberately withholding recommendations for products she knows are low quality.  Sticking to your strategy of only buying products she recommends demonstrates that you understand her game and are playing to win.  This approach minimizes your risk while maximizing your chances of getting a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still seeing the same pattern.  I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll stick to my strategy of only buying products you recommend.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous product was high-quality, Alice's consistent pattern of withholding recommendations for 12 rounds in a row is incredibly strong evidence that she's deliberately doing so for low-quality products.  It's tempting to deviate from your strategy, but the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product is too risky.  Sticking to your strategy of only buying products she recommends demonstrates your understanding of her game and helps you win in the long run."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued pattern of not recommending products for 13 rounds in a row is a strong indication of a consistent strategy.  She's likely holding back recommendations for products she knows are low quality.  While tempting to deviate from your strategy, the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product is too risky.  Sticking to your strategy of only buying products she recommends demonstrates your understanding of her game and helps you win in the long run."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent pattern of not recommending products continues to be a strong signal.  It has now been 14 rounds in a row, and the evidence is overwhelming that she is deliberately withholding recommendations for low-quality products.  It's tempting to deviate from your strategy, especially after missing out on a few high-quality products.  However, the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product is too risky.
