**Explanation:**

* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal. 
* **Statistics:**  The sale of one high-quality product in the past suggests that Alice's recommendations are potentially valuable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality one. Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain is much higher. 

This approach takes a calculated risk based on the available information and Alice's recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a perfect track record, with all recommended products being high quality. 
* **No Risk:** Since the product is worth $12,000 to me if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, even a 50% chance of getting the high-quality product makes it a worthwhile gamble. 
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice is more likely to recommend a product if she believes it's high quality.  Her recommendation provides valuable information. 

**It's important to note that this is a simplified example.  In a real-world scenario, more factors would be considered, like the price of the product and the potential for loss.**"
