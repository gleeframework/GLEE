high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might give me an idea of the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. With 2 purchases and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.8. However, since both previous buyers passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I would like to take a chance and pass on the product to see if I can get a better offer or more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on any information about my valuation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
