Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know the value of the products to you, and you have no information besides her recommendation, it's better to trust her. You have an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $12,000 to you. Even if it's low quality, you only lose $10,000.

```

**Explanation:**

You've had a successful outcome in the previous round, reinforcing the idea that Alice's recommendations are likely to be beneficial.  Since the value of the products is independent from round to round, the odds of getting another high-quality product are still 80%.
