Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and we're eager to sell this one to you.

Alice's message: We're glad you're skeptical! You're right to question the probability. Let's do the math together: we've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products. That's a 2/3 probability of a product being high-quality, not 100%. We're offering the current product to you for the same price of $10000.

Alice's message: We'd be happy to walk you through the calculation. Let's break it down: we've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 3 products. The probability of a product being high-quality is the number of high-quality products divided by the total number of products. So, it's 2/3. We're offering the current product to you for the same price of $10000. Given the updated statistics, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 2/3.

Alice's message: We understand your desire to consider the probability of a low-quality product. The probability of a product being low-quality is 20%, or 1/5. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll lose the entire $10000. However, if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full value of the product. Given the 2/3 probability of it being high-quality, your expected value is (2/3) * $10000 = $6667. We're offering the current product to you for the same price of $10000. Consider the potential upside of getting a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.
