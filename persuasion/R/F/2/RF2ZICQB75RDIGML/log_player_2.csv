**Explanation:**

While the odds are still stacked against getting a high-quality product (66.67% chance of low quality), the information that one high-quality product has already been sold is significant. 

* **It suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend a high-quality product** if she wants to maintain a positive reputation and encourage future buyers.
* **The potential reward is high:** A high-quality product would net you a $2,500 profit. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to take a calculated risk and purchase the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. However, given your recommendation and the fact that the previous two buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm hesitant to buy this one. I'm worried the chances of it being low quality are too high. I'll pass.""}

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Two out of two products sold have been high quality. This indicates a strong likelihood that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Positive Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation suggests she believes this specific product is valuable. 
* **Potential for High Reward:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($12,500) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

While there's still a risk, the current information strongly suggests a favorable outcome."
