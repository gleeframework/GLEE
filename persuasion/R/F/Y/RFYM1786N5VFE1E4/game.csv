high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You're the 19th buyer of the day. I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 19 so far, which is a 52.63% success rate. I'd be happy to help you simulate the probability of the product being high-quality. Let's assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% on average, and that the products are independently and identically distributed. Based on the binomial distribution, the probability of 10 high-quality products out of 19 is approximately 0.011%. This is an extremely low probability, suggesting that the previous buyer was very lucky. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I must warn you that the probability of it being high-quality is extremely low. Take a chance, but be aware of the risk.",
