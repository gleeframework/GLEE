  ""message"": ""Bob, I respect your caution, but I've got to tell you, this one is a game-changer. I've been in the business long enough to know when I've got a winner, and this is it. I'm not just talking about the price, although $1000000 is a small price to pay for what this product can do for you. I'm talking about the potential, the possibilities, the returns on investment.
