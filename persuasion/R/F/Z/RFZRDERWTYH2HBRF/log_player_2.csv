"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm confident in its quality and would like to assure you that I've taken every precaution to ensure its authenticity. I'm willing to provide you with a 10-year warranty on this product, and I'll even throw in a complimentary inspection by a third-party expert to verify its quality. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. I believe this is a fair price considering the warranty and inspection. What do you say?
