Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a high-quality one. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's reasonable to expect that the next product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality as well. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, a price that reflects the uncertainty of its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.
