**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Even though there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's recommendation adds valuable information. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation means the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Potential profit:**  If the product is high-quality, you stand to make a $20 profit ($120 value - $100 price).
* **Limited risk:** Even if the product is low-quality, you only lose the $100 price.  

**Reasoning:**  In this situation, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss.  Alice's recommendation provides a strong enough signal to make the purchase worthwhile."

**Explanation:**

* **Prior Information:** We know that Alice has a perfect track record, selling only high-quality products so far. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  She recommends buying, which suggests she believes the current product is high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a $120 value outweighs the risk of getting a $0 value product. Given Alice's track record, it's likely the product is high-quality.

**Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to buy the product.**"
