Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We've had a high-quality product sold in the previous round, which means we've now sold a total of 1 high-quality product out of 2 products. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to highlight that our store has a reputation for selling a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, and we can't guarantee the quality of any individual item. The price of this product is $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and make an offer?

Alice's message: The high-quality product sold in the previous round was a product that was offered to a buyer, and it was sold to them at the price of $1000000. The buyer who purchased it was satisfied with their decision. As for this product, I can tell you that it's a low-quality item, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that our store's statistics show that we've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far, which is a 33.33% success rate. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me provide you with some additional context. Our store has been selling products for a total of 4 rounds now, and we've sold 1 high-quality product. We've had 3 low-quality products offered, and 2 of them were passed on by buyers. This suggests that our store's success rate is actually 25% (1 high-quality product out of 4 total products). However, it's worth noting that we've had a higher number of low-quality products offered recently, which might be a temporary anomaly. The price of this product remains $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

We've had 3 high-quality products sold in the following rounds: 1, 3, 5, and now 8. This suggests that the high-quality products might be more likely to appear in the earlier rounds.
