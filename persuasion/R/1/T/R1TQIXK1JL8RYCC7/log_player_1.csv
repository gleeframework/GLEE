This is a tricky situation.  While you've only seen low-quality products so far, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%.  Since you now know this product is high-quality, you should recommend Bob buy it.  Here's why:

* **Bob's knowledge:**  Bob is aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. He's likely starting to think he's been unlucky so far.
* **Your knowledge:** You now have inside information that this product is indeed high-quality. 
* **Potential gain:**  Even if Bob is unsure about the value of a high-quality product, it's still a gamble worth taking given the potential reward.

You need to convince Bob that this is a good opportunity.  You could even try something like:

""Bob, I know you've been hesitant, but I have a strong feeling this one is different. It has all the hallmarks of a high-quality product."" 

While it's risky, this is the best chance you have to make a sale."

* **No downside:** You've already made a sale, so there's no risk in recommending this product even if Bob decides not to buy it.
