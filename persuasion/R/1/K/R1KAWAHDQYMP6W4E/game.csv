high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's reasonable to think that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product rather than any other factor.
