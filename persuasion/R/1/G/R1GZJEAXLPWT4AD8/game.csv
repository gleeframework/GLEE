,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to be the only one who's bought a low-quality product so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, given that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer also bought and it was low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide a more compelling reason to buy."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience with the product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's actual quality, but rather her strategy to manipulate the buyer into buying. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is of low quality. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I should trust your past recommendations, given that none of the previous buyers have bought high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get lucky."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice has recommended so far are low-quality. I'd like to wait for Alice to offer me a product without a recommendation, or for the statistics to change in a way that suggests a higher probability of a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on the statistics, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well."
