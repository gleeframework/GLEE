,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm interested in taking the chance on a potentially valuable product, and the initial sales record is promising.

I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are 2:1 against it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! We appreciate your honesty about the sales record being based on a small sample size.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We understand your concerns, and we respect your cautious approach. However, we'd like to highlight that we've now sold a total of 3 products, with 2 being high-quality.

We're confident that you'll be pleased with your purchase. Will you reconsider and take advantage of this opportunity?",

Will you take the chance on our product?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty about the quality control measures, but I'm not convinced by the statistics.
