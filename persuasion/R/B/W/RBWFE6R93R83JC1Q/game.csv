high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I would like to pass on this product. I know that the previous buyer purchased the product based on your recommendation, which means that the product was likely high-quality. However, I'm not sure if it's the only high-quality product left. If I pass on this product, it will be discarded, and I might miss out on a high-quality product. But if I buy it, I might be buying a low-quality product, which would be a waste of money. I'd rather play it safe and wait for more information."
