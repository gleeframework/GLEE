high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $1200000, and you'll miss out on a good deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to pay the full price for a product that's only worth $1200000 to you, especially since there's a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I want to assure you that this product is indeed a good opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the market value. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get rid of it quickly, and I think it's a fair price considering the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product that's only worth $1200000 to me. I'd be leaving $400000 on the table, and there's still a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you this product for $600000. I'm essentially giving it away at this price, and I'm taking a significant loss. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity and buy it, so I can move on to the next product. I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a profit if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still not convinced. At $600000, I'd be paying 50% more than the product is worth to me, and there's a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'd be taking on unnecessary risk, and I'm not willing to do that. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to make a compromise on the price. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $900000. I'm essentially giving you a $300000 discount from the market value, which is a significant concession. I'm hoping you'll see the value in this deal and take advantage of it. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm confident you'll regret missing out on this opportunity.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not falling for it. I know there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, and I'd be paying $900000 for it. Even with a $300000 discount, I'd still be overpaying by $100000 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're cautious, but I want to be transparent with you. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 'guarantee' that this product is high-quality. I'll throw in a separate product that's worth $200000, absolutely free, if you buy this one. That way, you'll be getting a high-quality product for $700000, which is a steal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying a 'guarantee' that the product is high-quality. If you're so confident it's high-quality, you should be willing to sell it to me at a price that reflects its true value. I'm not falling for the free product ploy either. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect that. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1100000, which is $100000 below the market value. I'm willing to make this concession because I want to get rid of this product quickly and move on to the next one. I'm confident you'll appreciate the value of this deal and take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not impressed by the $100000 discount. If I pay $1100000 for a product that's only worth $1200000 to me, I'd still be overpaying by $100000 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a full $200000 below the market value. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in this deal. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,7,I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that's worth $1200000 to me. I'd be overpaying by $200000 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1050000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm essentially giving you a $150000 discount. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm confident you'll regret missing out on this opportunity. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not willing to pay $1050000 for a product that's worth $1200000 to me. I'd still be overpaying by $150000 if it's low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll pass on this round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I want to make you a very different offer this time. I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. I'll essentially give it to you for free. I'm willing to absorb the loss just to get rid of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm surprised by the offer, but I'll take it. $0 is a price I'm happy to pay for a product that's worth $1200000 to me. I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal on the previous product! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000, just like I did in Round 8. I know you've seen the value in that price before, and I'm confident you'll appreciate it again. Plus, you've already proven that you're willing to take calculated risks, and I think this product is a great opportunity for you to make a profit.",
,,Bob,10,"I've already learned my lesson from the previous round. I paid $1000000 for a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to make the same mistake again. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand you're being cautious, but I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 'discount' of $500000 on the price, but only if you buy this product immediately. If you don't take it, the price will go back to the original $0, and I'll have to sell it to someone else. You'll be getting this low-quality product for $500000, which is a steal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not falling for the 'discount' trick. If I pay $500000 for a product that's worth $0 to me, I'd be overpaying by $500000. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll make a straightforward offer. I'll give you this low-quality product for $0, just like I did in Round 9. I'm willing to absorb the loss and get rid of it. I'm not trying to trick you or get you to overpay. I just want to get rid of this product and move on. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I'll take the free product. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, so I might as well take another one for free.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took advantage of the free product again! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, just like I did in Round 8. I know you've seen the value in that price before, and I'm confident you'll appreciate it again. You've already taken a risk and come out on the losing end, but this time you can make a profit if you buy this product.",
,,Bob,13,"I've been burned twice already. I'm not going to make the same mistake again. I've lost $2000000 on two low-quality products, and I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 on a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand you're being cautious, but I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 'certified' guarantee that this product is high-quality. I'll even throw in a third-party inspection report that verifies its quality. If you don't like the report, I'll give you a full refund. This is the most secure way to buy a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. I'll sell it to you for $1000000.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not falling for the 'certified' guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'd still be out $1000000. I don't care about the inspection report or the guarantee. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not going to offer you anything else. I'll just say that this is your last chance to buy a product from me. If you don't take it, I'll be out of business. I'll give you this low-quality product for $0. It's free. You can't lose anything, and you might as well take it.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to pass up a free product. I've lost $3000000 on three low-quality products, but I'll take another one for free. At least I won't be out any more money.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you took the free product again! I'm surprised you're still willing to take a chance on me, despite the previous losses. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $800000. I know it's not the original price, but I'm willing to make a concession. I think you've learned your lesson about the low-quality products, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this high-quality one.",
,,Bob,16,I've lost $4000000 on four low-quality products. I'm not going to take another chance on a product that might be high-quality. I'll pass on this round.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm not going to push you to buy something you're not comfortable with. I'll just say that this is your last chance to buy a high-quality product from me. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a personal guarantee that I'll personally cover any losses if it turns out to be low-quality. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to ensure you get a fair deal.",
,,Bob,17,I don't think a personal guarantee from you changes the fact that I'd still be out $1000000 if the product is low-quality. I've been burned too many times already. I'll pass on this round.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not going to push you to buy anything. I'll just say that I'm willing to give you the product for $1000000, and I'll also give you a full refund if you return it within 24 hours. You can try it out, and if you don't like it, you can get your money back. That's the best offer I can make.",
,,Bob,18,I'm not going to take a product that's worth $1200000 to me and then return it for a full refund if it's low-quality. I'd still be out $1000000. I'll pass on this round.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm not going to offer you anything else. I'll just say that I've had enough. I'll give you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll even throw in a personal thank-you note. That's it. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not impressed by the personal thank-you note. I've been offered this product multiple times before, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,Fine. I've had enough of your refusal. I'll give you this low-quality product for free. I don't care anymore. Take it and leave me alone.,
