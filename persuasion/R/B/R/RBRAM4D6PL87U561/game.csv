low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I will rely on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $4000000 and the price is $1000000, the expected value is ($4000000 * 0.3333) - $1000000 = $333200. However, considering the seller's recommendation is likely biased and the lack of information, I choose to pass on this product."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust the recommendation. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the risk is too high for me to buy at this price."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Since I have no information about the seller's previous sales record, I must rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the price of $1000000 and the potential value of $4000000 for a high-quality product, the expected value is $1333200 (0.3333 * $4000000). However, since Alice recommends buying the product and I don't have any additional information, I will assume that Alice recommends buying every product, regardless of quality. Therefore, I will not buy the product, as the price is higher than the expected value without additional information."
