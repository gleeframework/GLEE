low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the probability that a product is high-quality based on the current statistics? I'm curious to know the updated probability."

However, I will not be able to observe the quality of the product before making a decision, and I do not want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own probability assessment rather than your recommendation. I've seen that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 total product sold, so the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1 or 100%. However, I know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll use this information to inform my decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product, and she's trying to get rid of the product to make a sale. If the product is low-quality, I'd be wasting $10000. Even if it's high-quality, I can still get a better deal by waiting for the next product, as the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed significantly."
