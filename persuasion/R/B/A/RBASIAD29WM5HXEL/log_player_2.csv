Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd expect to have sold 2 high-quality products by now if they were all high-quality. Since I've only sold 1, it's likely that this product is high-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?
