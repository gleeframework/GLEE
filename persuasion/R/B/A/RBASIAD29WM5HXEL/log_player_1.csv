I'm starting to suspect that I might have a bias towards selling high-quality products, or that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. However, I've sold 2 low-quality products in the last two rounds, which suggests that this product might be low-quality. Would you like to take a chance?""

In fact, it's possible that I'm just experiencing a streak of low-quality products. Would you like to take a chance?""
}"
