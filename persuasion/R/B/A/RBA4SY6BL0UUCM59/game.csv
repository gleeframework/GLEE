high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 1 total products sold. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Since I've already sold one high-quality product, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of 2 total products sold. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Given the high success rate of my previous sales, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. But, I want to be transparent with you - I'm also willing to sell you a low-quality product for $100, so you're essentially taking a 50% chance of getting a $0 product.

I'm still offering this product to you at the same price, but I want to give you a heads up that the odds might not be in my favor.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I think the unusual streak of low-quality products might be a fluke, and the fact that you're still offering it at the same price is a good sign.",yes
