low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also considering the fact that the first buyer passed on the product, which might indicate that it's low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm worried that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it's possible that the products being sold are all low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00% and I can potentially get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, Alice. Given that you don't recommend it and none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, it suggests the product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of 80%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold will increase with more buyers."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see a more successful track record before committing to a purchase."
