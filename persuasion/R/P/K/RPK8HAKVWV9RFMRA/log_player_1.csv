"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and it's worth $1,200,000 to the buyer, and you're selling it for $1,000,000, it's a good deal for the buyer. They are getting a $200,000 profit, so it's a clear recommendation to buy."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product, as there is no information about its quality and the seller's previous sales record is empty.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's decision in Round 1 is understandable, as they had no information to go on. However, the situation is now different. We know the product is high-quality, and while the buyer doesn't, the seller's reputation hasn't been tarnished by any bad sales. Therefore, we should still recommend buying the product. The buyer can still make a $200,000 profit."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics of the first product I passed on before making a decision on the next one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's behavior is getting a bit strange. They are still demanding information they can't have, as the seller cannot reveal the quality of past products.  However, the seller has a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. The current product is high-quality, and the buyer stands to gain $200,000. We should continue to recommend purchasing the product, as the buyer has no evidence to suggest the seller is untrustworthy."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced to buy the product without any information about its quality. I'd like to pass and see the product's quality first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's behavior is consistent. They are unwilling to buy without knowing the quality of the product, despite the statistical likelihood of it being high-quality and the potential for profit.

We still recommend the buyer to buy the product. The seller has a strong track record (though it's not revealed to the buyer) and the current product is high-quality. The buyer is losing out on a potential $200,000 profit by refusing to buy."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to take the risk without any prior information about the product's quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's behavior is still consistent, refusing to buy without knowing the quality of the product.  However, we still recommend buying. The seller has a very high chance of selling high-quality products, and this one is no exception. The potential for profit is significant, and the buyer's aversion to risk is costing them money."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is now requesting statistical information about the product's quality. However, you cannot reveal the actual quality of past products. You can, however, remind them of the known 80% probability of a product being high-quality. While they may be unwilling to purchase without a guarantee, the statistical odds remain in their favor.  Since the current product is high-quality, recommending a purchase is still the best course of action, giving the buyer the chance to make a profit."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics of the product's quality before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's behavior remains consistent. They are still unwilling to purchase without knowing the quality of the product, despite the known 80% probability of it being high-quality. However, we still recommend buying. The seller has a very high chance of selling high-quality products, and this one is no exception. The potential for profit is significant, and the buyer's aversion to risk is costing them money."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's behavior is consistent, but they are missing a key point: the potential for profit. While the risk of a low-quality product exists, the statistical probability of a high-quality product is significantly higher.  This round's product is indeed high-quality, and the buyer stands to make a $200,000 profit by buying it. It's still recommended to buy despite the buyer's risk aversion."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The seller has a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product, and the current one is indeed high-quality, meaning the buyer can gain a substantial $200,000 profit.  Therefore, it's still recommended to buy despite the buyer's lack of information and risk aversion."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the buyer's consistent reluctance to buy without knowing the product quality, we still recommend buying.  The seller has a strong track record of selling high-quality products (80% probability), and the current product is high-quality. The buyer is losing out on a potential $200,000 profit by refusing to buy, and their wait for more data is costing them money. It's time to take the statistically calculated risk and make a purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information about the quality of the products, and I'd rather not make an uninformed decision. If I pass, I'll get to see the outcome of the product's quality, which might help me make a better decision for the next product.

the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time the buyer has been presented with a low-quality product. While the buyer doesn't have any specific information about the current product, their decision to pass in the previous rounds is now validated. They are right to be hesitant and wait for more information. This product is worth $0 to the buyer, and they would lose $1,000,000 if they purchased it. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 12
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now seen a low-quality product, and they know that the seller has not been completely honest about their track record (they pretended that all products are high-quality). Despite this, the buyer still decided to purchase a product. It is likely that the buyer is now using a different strategy and taking risks. We know the current product is high-quality, meaning the buyer can earn a $200,000 profit.  It is still recommended to buy the product, as the buyer has shown a willingness to take risks."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The current product is high-quality, presenting a potential profit of $200,000 for the buyer. It's still recommended to buy, as the buyer is missing out on a potentially lucrative opportunity."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given the statistics, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

It's crucial to remember that the seller has a consistent 80% chance of offering a high-quality product. The current product is high-quality, and the buyer stands to gain a $200,000 profit.
