That way, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain.

Alice's message: I apologize for the confusion in my previous message. You are correct that the sequence of 6 high-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I should have been more careful with my wording. To clarify, I'll provide the actual numbers: out of 7 products sold, 6 have been high-quality and 1 has been low-quality. This suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely higher than 50%. I'm offering this next product for $1000000.
