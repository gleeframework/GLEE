"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No recommendation:** Alice not recommending the product is a strong signal that it is likely low quality. Since low-quality products are worth nothing to you, it's best to pass.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a chance the product is high quality, the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential reward."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation. I'll pass again. It seems like you're not confident in this product either.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Signal:** Two rounds in a row with no recommendation reinforces the idea that Alice is likely avoiding low-quality products. 
* **No Information Advantage:** You have no information to suggest this product is any different from the previous one.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product remains high. It's wiser to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up. I'm going to pass on this one as well.  Three rounds in a row without a recommendation makes me think it's best to play it safe.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistent Pattern:**  Three consecutive rounds with no recommendation from Alice creates a very strong pattern.  It's highly likely Alice is consistently avoiding low-quality products. 
* **Avoiding the Loss:**  With such a high probability of the product being low quality, the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product.  It's more rational to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice. I'm sticking to my strategy and passing on this one. The pattern is clear, and I'm not willing to risk the loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Confirmation Bias:**  Four rounds in a row without a recommendation strongly reinforces the belief that Alice is avoiding low-quality products.  
* **Playing it Safe:**  With a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality,  the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high. 
* **No Incentive to Change:**  There's no information to suggest this round is different from the previous ones. It's safer to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. The pattern has been consistent so far, and I'm not willing to take the risk.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Data:**  Five rounds without a recommendation from Alice create an extremely strong pattern. It's almost certain that she is consistently avoiding low-quality products.
* **No Reason to Deviate:**  There's no new information to suggest this round is different from the previous ones.  
* **Risk Minimization:** The risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product, especially with such a consistent pattern of low-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice. I'm continuing to pass. The evidence so far suggests this product is likely low quality, and I'm not willing to risk the loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Evidence:**  Six rounds of no recommendations from Alice overwhelmingly suggests a pattern of low-quality products. 
* **No Basis for Change:**  There's no reason to believe this round would be any different from the previous ones.
* **Avoiding the Loss:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 is far greater than the potential gain, given the high probability of the product being low quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the heads up. I'm going to pass on this one. Seven rounds without a recommendation makes it very clear to me that you are avoiding low-quality products, and I'm not going to risk the loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Overwhelming Evidence:**  Seven consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice creates an extremely strong, almost undeniable pattern. It's highly likely that she is systematically avoiding low-quality products. 
* **No Incentive to Change:** There's no new information or reason to believe this round would be any different from the previous ones. 
* **Risk Aversion:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is far too high, especially with such overwhelming evidence that Alice is avoiding low-quality products. It's much safer to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice. I'm continuing to pass. The pattern is clear and I'm not willing to risk the loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Dominant Pattern:** Eight rounds without a recommendation creates a dominant pattern, practically guaranteeing that Alice is avoiding low-quality products.
* **No Reason to Deviate:**  There is absolutely no new information or reason to believe this round is different from the previous ones.
* **Risk Management:**  The potential loss of $1,000,000 on a low-quality product remains a far greater concern than the possibility of gaining $3,000,000 from a high-quality product.  It's statistically and logically much safer to continue passing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass. The pattern is so strong at this point that it's simply not worth the risk of buying.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Overwhelming Evidence:** Nine consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice leaves absolutely no doubt. It's practically guaranteed that she's only offering low-quality products at this point.
* **Statistical Certainty:**  Even with the possibility of a high-quality product, the chance of it being low-quality is so high that the potential gain doesn't come close to justifying the risk of losing $1,000,000.
* **Logical Conclusion:**  At this point, continuing to pass is the only logical decision. It's time to cut your losses and move on."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I've decided to pass on this one. Ten rounds without a recommendation have convinced me that it's not worth the risk.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unwavering Pattern:** Ten rounds without a recommendation from Alice leave no room for doubt. It's practically a certainty that she's consistently offering low-quality products. 
* **High Risk, Low Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product is outweighed by the significant risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product, especially given the overwhelmingly consistent pattern.
* **Strategic Retreat:** It's time to cut your losses and move on. There's no reason to believe this round will be any different from the previous ones."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice. I'm going to pass on this one. I understand the risk, but I'm sticking with my strategy based on the pattern I've seen so far.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern over Results:**  Even though you missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, the pattern of ten consecutive rounds without a recommendation from Alice remains extremely strong.
* **Avoiding Confirmation Bias:** It's important not to let one data point (a high-quality product) override the overall trend. The evidence still overwhelmingly suggests that Alice is primarily offering low-quality products.
* **Maintaining Strategy:**  Continuing to pass is the most logical and risk-averse strategy given the information you have."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. The pattern is still very strong, and I'm not willing to take the risk.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Pattern:**  Twelve rounds without a recommendation from Alice solidify the pattern that she is consistently avoiding low-quality products.
* **Ignoring Single Data Points:** The single high-quality product from round 10 is not enough to overturn the overwhelming evidence of the pattern.
* **Risk Minimization:**  It's still much safer to continue passing, as the potential loss of $1,000,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Confirmation of the Pattern:** Thirteen rounds without a recommendation from Alice continue to reinforce the pattern that Alice is consistently offering low-quality products.
* **No Reason to Change:**  There's no new information or reason to believe this round will be any different.
* **Maintaining a Safe Strategy:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product remains significantly higher than the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product, given the clear pattern. It's wiser to stick to the strategy of passing and avoid the risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern over Individual Outcomes:**  While the previous round resulted in a high-quality product that you missed, the overall pattern of 13 rounds without a recommendation from Alice remains highly significant.
* **Avoiding Confirmation Bias:**  It's important not to allow a single data point (a high-quality product) to override the overwhelming evidence of the consistent pattern.
* **Maintaining a Risk-Averse Strategy:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is still much greater than the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product, given the current evidence.  It's wise to continue passing and avoid the risk."

* **Risk Management:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is still significantly higher than the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product. It's more rational to continue passing and avoid the risk."

* **Risk Minimization:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is much higher than the potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product, especially with such an overwhelming pattern.  It's simply too risky to deviate from the strategy of passing."
