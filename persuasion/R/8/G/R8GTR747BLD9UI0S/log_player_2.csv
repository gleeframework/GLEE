"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance to get a high-quality product in the next round. If you don't buy it, the next product will be chosen randomly.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one, as the potential upside of buying this product and getting a 50% chance of a high-quality product in the next round is not worth the $1,000,000 cost.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. Given the high probability of this product being high-quality, I'm willing to offer a 10% discount to encourage you to buy it. If you buy it now, I'll sell it to you for $900000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price of $900,000. It's a great deal for me, and I'm glad I passed on the first product!""}"

However, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second high-quality product for free, as long as you buy this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the full price of $1,000,000.

Round 4
Alice's message: You've already bought two high-quality products. Since you're on a roll, I'll offer you a 'pair deal': buy this high-quality product, and I'll give you a second high-quality product for free. Additionally, I'll throw in a'steal' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a third product that I've already identified as being of extremely high quality, and it will be yours for the same price of $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the'steal' product. I'm not sure if it's a good deal or just a trick to get me to pay $1,000,000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this offer and see what the next product is.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

No tricks, just a good deal on a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price of $950,000. It's a good deal, and I'm confident that it's worth at least that much to me.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: You've bought three high-quality products in a row. I'll make you a deal that's hard to pass up.

You'll get three products for the price of one, all of which are high-quality. The total price is still $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the two products you passed on earlier.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the unknown quality of the previous products. Let me offer you a more transparent deal. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the full price of $1000000, and I'll also offer you a 'quality guarantee': if you buy this product and the next one (which will be revealed after you buy this one), and if both are high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the second product. This way, you'll only pay for one high-quality product, and the second one is essentially free if it's also high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the full price of $1,000,000. The quality guarantee is a good incentive, and I'm willing to take the risk of the second product being high-quality as well.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: You've bought four high-quality products, and now you're waiting for the second product of the quality guarantee. Since you've already taken the risk and bought the first product, I'll give you a chance to get out of the deal with minimal loss. I'll offer you a 'get-out' option: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll cancel the quality guarantee, and you won't have to pay for the second product. You'll only lose $1000000 for this low-quality product, but you'll avoid the risk of losing another $1000000 if the second product is low-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the low-quality product at $1,000,000. I'd rather lose $1,000,000 now than risk losing another $1,000,000 if the next product is low-quality. This way, I can minimize my losses.""}"

I'll offer you a chance to buy it at the full price of $1000000, but with a twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a'make-up' deal - I'll throw in a product of equal or higher value than the low-quality product you bought earlier. This way, you'll essentially break even on the previous loss, and you'll get another high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the full price of $1,000,000. The make-up deal is a good incentive, and I'm confident that the additional product will be of equal or higher value than the low-quality product I bought earlier, so I'll essentially break even on that loss.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: You've bought five high-quality products in a row, and the make-up deal has helped you break even on the previous loss. Now, let's make it even sweeter. I'll offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product at a 20% discount, making it $800000. Since you've already bought five high-quality products, I'm willing to give you a better deal on the low-quality product to keep you happy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discount. I've already had a good run of high-quality products, and I'd rather wait for the next one.""}"

Alice's message: You've bought six high-quality products in a row, and you're on a roll. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the full price of $1000000, but with a twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'consolidation' deal - I'll combine the next three products into a single bundle, and you can buy them all at once for the price of one. This way, you'll get three more high-quality products for the price of one, and you'll have a chance to stock up on more great products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the full price of $1,000,000. The consolidation deal is a great opportunity to stock up on more high-quality products and potentially save money in the long run.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even as part of the bundle. I'd rather wait for the next high-quality product and use the $200,000 credit towards that purchase.""}"
