high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been 6 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics. With 7 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
