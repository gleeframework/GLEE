high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen a product sell for $1000000, which is likely to be high-quality. I'm offering you a similar product now. Since the previous product sold for the same price, I'm willing to offer a 10% discount for this one. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Buy it now for $900000!",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced by the discount offer. I'd like to wait and see more sales data before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. Since you're not convinced by the discount offer, I'll give you some more information. Out of the 2 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100% (or at least, it's very likely). I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Buy it now for $1000000!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm intrigued by the updated statistics. With a 100% probability of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've just seen 3 high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible streak. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, not 100%. This means that there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. Considering the high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to offer a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and you can keep the product. Buy it now for $1000000, and let's make it a 4th high-quality product in a row!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take you up on your offer, but I'll also take a moment to think about it. I'll come back to you with a decision after a short moment.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome back to the conversation! I see you're weighing your options carefully. I'd like to remind you that the guarantee I offered earlier still stands: if this product is low-quality, you'll get a full refund. However, considering the 4 high-quality products sold in a row, I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, making it $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the offer, but I'm only doing so because of the discount. I'm hoping this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've just seen 5 high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible streak. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, not 100%. I'm not going to offer a discount this time, but I'll give you a different kind of assurance. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you access to a special 'VIP' section where you can purchase future high-quality products at a 10% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Buy it now for $1000000!",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm tempted by the streak, but I'm also cautious. I'll take the offer and see if the product is high-quality. If it's not, I'll be more careful next time. But if it is, I'll take advantage of the VIP offer and look forward to the discount on future high-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited about the VIP offer! However, I'd like to remind you that the streak of high-quality products has ended. This product, unfortunately, is not high-quality. I want to assure you that this is an isolated incident, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not going to offer a discount this time, but I'll give you a more transparent look at the numbers. Out of 6 products sold, 5 are high-quality. I'm confident that the next product will be high-quality as well. Buy it now for $1000000, and let's get back on track!",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Since the previous buyer didn't take the offer, I'll give you a chance to make a better decision. I'll offer you a'split-decision' option: you can buy this product for $1000000, or you can wait for the next product and get a 20% discount on the price. The catch is that if you wait, you won't know the quality of the next product until you buy it. What would you prefer?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to wait for the next product and get a 20% discount on the price. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the discount is a good incentive to wait.",no

,,Alice,9,"You're a strategic buyer, and I like that. Since you're waiting for the next product, I'll give you a brief update on the numbers. Out of 7 products sold, 6 are high-quality, and the last one was low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'll give you an additional incentive to buy now. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a bonus: a free consultation with one of our expert team members to help you get the most out of your purchase.
