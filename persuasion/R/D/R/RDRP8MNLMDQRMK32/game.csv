high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only doing this because there's no data to go on yet. I'm hoping the first product is high quality and will set a good precedent for future sales."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 high-quality product was sold, but that's a small sample size. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, this is likely due to sampling bias. I'd like to wait for more data to form a more accurate estimate of the proportion of high-quality products."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but I'm also aware that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far.
