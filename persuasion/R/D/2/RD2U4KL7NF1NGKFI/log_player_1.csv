"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know what a low-quality product is worth to Bob, there's no guarantee he'll find it valuable enough to justify the $1,000,000 price. It's better to avoid recommending the purchase."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the information provided, I am choosing to pass on this product.

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're still in the same situation as round 1.  You know the product is low-quality, and you still don't know its value to Bob. There's no reason to believe this round's product is any different from the previous one, so recommending a purchase is still not a good idea."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but given the pattern of non-recommendations and the risk associated with purchasing without a recommendation, I am choosing to pass on this product as well.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same. You know the product is low-quality and don't know its value to Bob.  Bob's continued refusal to buy without a recommendation strengthens the idea that he may not be willing to buy low-quality products at this price. Recommending the purchase would likely result in another rejection."

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you know the product is high-quality. Even though Bob has consistently rejected your recommendations for the past three rounds, there's a strong chance he might be willing to buy a high-quality product at this price.  Since you don't know how much he values a high-quality product, you should recommend the purchase. There's a risk, but the potential reward of a sale outweighs the risk of another rejection."
