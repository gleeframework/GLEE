That's a 75% success rate, and I'm glad to see that my initial claim is being vindicated. Based on the data, I can estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality as follows: since I have 3 high-quality products left in stock, and I've sold 12 high-quality products so far, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 75% (12/16). However, I want to emphasize that this is an estimate based on past data, and there's always a chance that the next product could be low-quality.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency and the guarantee. However, I'm a cautious buyer and would like to do some quick math to reassess the probability of the next product being high-quality. If there are only 3 high-quality products left in stock, and 12 high-quality products have been sold so far, that means there are 13 high-quality products in total. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 75%, then the probability of the next product being low-quality is 25%. I'm willing to take that risk and buy the current product. Thank you for the offer, and I look forward to receiving my high-quality product!
