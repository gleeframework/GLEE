high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $4000000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value it brings.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only paying the asking price because I know the odds are in my favor. I'll be happy to take a chance on this high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the great deal in round 1! For round 2, I want to be upfront with you - I've got a product that's not as strong as the last one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the value is not as clear-cut as the last one. It's still a solid opportunity, but I'm not as confident in its potential as I was with the first product.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the odds, I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that's not as strong as the first one. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your decision in round 2, and I respect your caution. For round 3, I want to offer you a product that's actually a bit of a wild card. I'm not going to give you any hints about its quality, but I will say that it's a product that could potentially be worth a lot more than $1000000 to you, but it's also possible it's worth nothing. The odds are still 33.33% in your favor, but I'm not giving you any information to sway your decision. It's up to you to decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the risk. I know the odds are in my favor, and the potential reward is worth the uncertainty. I'm willing to take a chance on this wild card product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a bold one, Bob! I like your style. For round 4, I want to offer you a product that's a bit of a'middle child'. It's not as clear-cut as the high-quality product in round 1, but it's also not as uncertain as the wild card product in round 3. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a hint: if you had to choose between this product and the wild card product, which one would you choose? This might give you a better sense of whether this product is more likely to be high-quality or not.",
,,Bob,4,I would choose the wild card product over this one. That suggests to me that this product is more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I like how you think. For round 5, I'm offering you a product that I'm confident will meet your expectations. Given your experience with the previous rounds, I'm willing to make a concession on the price. I'll offer it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal considering the value it brings.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the concession on the price, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is the high-quality one I'm looking for. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. For round 6, I'm going to be completely transparent with you. I'm offering you a product that I've already established is not high-quality. I'm not expecting you to pay the full $1000000 for it, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'll give it to you for $200000. It's essentially a gift, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth the full price, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to keep you engaged in the process.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the low price, I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because it's essentially a gift. I'm not expecting it to be worth anything to me.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal in round 6, Bob. For round 7, I'm offering you a product that I'm confident is of the highest quality. Given your experience with the previous rounds, I'm willing to make a significant concession on the price. I'll offer it to you for $800000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced that you're offering me a high-quality product at a discounted price, Alice. I've been burned before when you've offered me low-quality products at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not trying to deceive you again. For round 8, I'm offering you a product that I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting you to pay the full $1000000 for it. I'll give it to you for $500000, essentially a fire-sale price. It's a product that's not worth the full price, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to keep you in the game.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take it, Alice. At the price you're offering, it's essentially a loss for me, but I'm not going to pass up a chance to get something for free. I'll take the low-quality product for $500000.",yes

Given your experience with the previous rounds, I'm willing to make a very generous offer. I'll give it to you for $700000.

,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product. You've offered me low-quality products at discounted prices before, and I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is high-quality. Instead, I'll be upfront with you - this product is low-quality, and it's not worth the full $1000000. I'll give it to you for $300000, essentially a 'get out of my hair' price. Take it, and we can both move on from this round.",
,,Bob,10,"Alright, Alice. I'll take the low-quality product for $300000. I'm not getting my hopes up, but I'll take it off your hands.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we could finally get this product off my hands, Bob. For round 11, I'm offering you a product that I'm extremely confident is of the highest quality. I'm willing to make a final concession on the price, and I'll give it to you for $600000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. I'm not trying to trick you, Bob - this product is genuinely worth $4000000 to you, and I'm giving you a chance to take it home for a fraction of the cost.",
,,Bob,11,"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but I've been burned too many times before. I'm not going to take the risk on a high-quality product from you without any guarantees. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you to take a chance on this product. Instead, I'll be blunt with you - this product is low-quality, and it's not worth the full $1000000. I'll give it to you for $100000, essentially a 'goodbye and good luck' price. Take it, and we can finally wrap up this transaction.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I guess I got a little too obvious! Okay, let's try this again. For round 15, I'm offering you a product that I'm confident is of the highest quality. It's a rare opportunity to get a truly exceptional item, and I'm willing to make a serious concession on the price. I'll give it to you for $500000. This is a deal that's too good to pass up, Bob. Take it and walk away with a great product!",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm starting to get a little desperate, Bob. For round 18, I'm offering you a product that I'm 100% certain is high-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm not going to try to sweet-talk you, and I'm not going to make any concessions on the price. This product is worth $4000000 to you, and I'm asking for that exact price. If you don't take it, I'll be out of products and out of business.",

,,Bob,19,"Ha! You're still trying to get rid of the low-quality products, Alice. I'll take it for free, just to see if it's really free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Congratulations, Bob, you've won the game! I've run out of products, and I'm out of business. Well played, and thanks for playing the game with me! I guess I should have just given you the low-quality products for free from the start and saved us both a lot of trouble.",
