high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I would like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards the previous 3 buyers who bought the product. The fact that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3 suggests that the remaining products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
