Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the previous product was high-quality and the buyer bought it, I now know that the buyer is willing to pay $1,000,000 for a high-quality product.

Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the previous product was high-quality, I can infer that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%.

However, since the previous buyer bought the high-quality product, I can also infer that the expected value of a high-quality product to this new buyer is at least $1,000,000.
