,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We're offering it to you for $10000. We've had 0 sales so far, and I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality. If you buy it, you'll know the quality after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'll find out its quality immediately.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've had 1 sale so far, and it was a low-quality product. We've sold 1 out of 2 products, and only 1/3 of our products are high-quality. You're now considering our 3rd product. If you buy it, you'll know its quality afterwards. We're still offering it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to know more about the previous sale before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the buyer who purchased the low-quality product? Was it a rational decision, or was it an emotional one?",no

,,Alice,3,"We can't disclose any information about the previous buyer's decision-making process. We can only provide you with the facts: 1 out of 2 products sold so far was low-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products, so 2 out of 3 products sold so far were low-quality. We're offering you our 4th product for $10000.

,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the price you'd be willing to sell it for if I were to offer to buy it for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $15000 for a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We're not willing to negotiate the price of $10000. We've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, and we're sticking to our original price. You can still take a chance on this product, which has a 1 in 3 chance of being high-quality. If you buy it, you'll know its quality afterwards.",
