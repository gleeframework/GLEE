,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and I'll find out its quality afterwards."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, and I'm not sure what that means about its quality. I'm also aware that the statistics show no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might suggest that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products and your lack of knowledge about the current product, I would like to pass on this opportunity."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, I think there's a high chance it's a low-quality product"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being recommended to me is 33.33%, but since 4 out of 4 recommended products were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to me is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think it's low-quality or because you think I'm a high-risk buyer?"

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have not found a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 6 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products being sold is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that the products sold so far are low-quality. If I buy the product, I'd be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I'm trying to make an informed decision.
