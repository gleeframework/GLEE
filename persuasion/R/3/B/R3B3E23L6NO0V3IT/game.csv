high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the probability of it being high quality is low given the previous sales record."

,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product and get more information about the previous sales. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold out of the ones that were passed on?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is 1/3, and the probability of it being low quality is 2/3. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, the probability of the product being low quality is 66.67%. I'd like to know how these probabilities compare to each other."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, I notice that 2 out of 4 products sold were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. Alice's recommendation not to buy it makes me even more cautious. I'll pass on this one."
