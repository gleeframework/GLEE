,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not convinced to buy based on the lack of sales data, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the result of its quality before making a decision, as the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the statistics are reset and I don't have any information to go on. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous sales record. If she had a good track record of selling high-quality products, I'd be more cautious. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. Given the recommendation from Alice, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality, so I'll pass."

I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers all passed on the products, and none of them were high quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it seems likely that the previous products were all low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
