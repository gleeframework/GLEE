,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, regardless of its quality.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially since the previous two buyers didn't take the product either. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the products despite no high-quality products being sold, it's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products.

I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products and none have been high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
