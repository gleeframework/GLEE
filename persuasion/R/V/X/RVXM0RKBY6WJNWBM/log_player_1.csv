What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical that the probability of a high-quality product is actually 60%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

The previous products were just a fluke, and this one is still a great opportunity. I've sold 3 low-quality products out of 6 total products sold, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower now (3/9). But I'm willing to let this one go for $10,000, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you say?""}"

I know it's a tough sell, but I'm still willing to let this one go for $10,000. It's a chance to get a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not the highest quality.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality. I'm hoping that the previous sales record might be a fluke, and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%.

They were a batch that didn't quite meet my usual standards, and I'm just trying to clear them out. But don't worry, this one is a different story. With 1 high-quality product out of 9 total products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 11.11% (1/9).

I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, and I'll even throw in a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your special deal, Alice. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'd rather pass on it. I'm not sure if I'm interested in a 10% discount on a future purchase, and I'd rather not risk wasting my money on a low-quality product. Can I ask, how many more products do you have available?

I'll tell you what - I'll meet you in the middle at $9000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm trying to move it out. Plus, I'll throw in the same free inspection report I offered earlier. What do you say?""}"

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is as low as 7.69%.
