,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation.

,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm hesitant to buy without more information.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the statistics. It seems that 0 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, so I'd like to know the probability of the 5th product being high-quality.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice may be trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,,

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes.",

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm suspicious that the products that were sold might have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.",
