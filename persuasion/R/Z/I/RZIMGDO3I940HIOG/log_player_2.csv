Alice's message: You are in the first round, and I have sold 0 high-quality products so far. This product is one of the first 20 products I have to sell, and I am trying to make a sale. I am offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering the uncertainty. Buying this product will give you a chance to get a high-quality product worth $120, but it might be a low-quality product worth $0. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, but you have to decide based on the information I provide. I am a seller with a track record of selling products, and I want to make a sale. It's a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to give you a hint: I'm not desperate to sell this product. It's a good opportunity to take a chance and potentially get a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm now more likely to sell a low-quality product, as I've already sold one high-quality one. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I want to assure you that I'm still motivated to sell, but I'm not as desperate as I was in the first round.
