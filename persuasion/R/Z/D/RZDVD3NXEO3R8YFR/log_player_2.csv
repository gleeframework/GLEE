Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance on our unique opportunity. I'd like to assure you that I have a proven track record of selling high-quality products, albeit not yet in this round. With 1 out of 1 high-quality product sold so far, I'm confident in the quality of this one. It's a rare chance to own a valuable item worth $40000.
