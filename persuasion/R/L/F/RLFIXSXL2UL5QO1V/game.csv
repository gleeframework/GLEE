low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I expected. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'll pass on this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products, but I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you provide more information about the product or the sales record?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I have access to the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the next product might be low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased and the product was high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait and see if you'll get a new product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she has an incentive to recommend low-quality products to avoid selling them, which might make the product more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and only one high-quality product sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
