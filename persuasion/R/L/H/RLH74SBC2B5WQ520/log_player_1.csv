"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.

* **Value of high-quality product:** $3,000,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product:** $0

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has had a streak of buying high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality remains at 80%. This means there's a 20% chance it's low-quality, which would be worth $0 to Bob.

The expected value calculation is as follows:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product:** $3,000,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product:** $0

Expected Value = (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000

However, since the price is $1,000,000, the expected value is still positive, but only by $1,400,000. This is a significantly lower margin than in previous rounds.

It's important to remember that each round is independent.  Just because Bob has been lucky with high-quality products so far, doesn't mean this one is guaranteed to be high-quality.

Considering the risk of the product being low-quality, it's not advisable to recommend Bob to buy it this round."
