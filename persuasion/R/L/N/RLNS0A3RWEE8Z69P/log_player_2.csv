"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality except Alice's recommendation, and there's a 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality, you might as well take the gamble.  The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll see what you have to offer in the next round.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a piece of information to consider.  Since she's not recommending the product, it's likely she has some insight that it's low quality. While it could be wrong, it's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product. There's no real downside to passing, as you can potentially get a better product in the next round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alright, I'm willing to take another chance. I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now more valuable, since we know she has some understanding of the product's quality. In the last round, her lack of recommendation led to a low-quality product, so now, her recommendation has a higher chance of being a high-quality product.  The potential reward of $30,000 (high-quality value minus price) still outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a pattern. She's recommending a product, and it's high quality, and she's not recommending a product, and it's low quality.  While it's not a perfect system, it's a good enough indicator to use. It's safer to pass on this product."
