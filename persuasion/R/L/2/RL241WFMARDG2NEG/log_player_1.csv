Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:** He's seen three low-quality products in a row. 
* **No information advantage:**  Alice has no way to signal the quality of the product to Bob. Even though this one is high-quality, Bob has no reason to believe it's different from the previous ones.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Bob would be risking $100 for a 50/50 chance of getting a product worth $125. That's not a good risk-reward scenario."

```

The situation remains the same as in Round 4. Alice still has no way to signal the quality of the product, and Bob has no reason to believe this product is any different than the previous ones.  The risk of losing $100 still outweighs the potential reward of $25."

* **No new information:** Alice still has no way to signal the quality of this product. 
* **Risk remains:**  Bob is still risking $100 for a 50/50 chance of getting a worthless product. 

It's highly likely Bob will regret buying this round, but from Alice's perspective, there's no reason to recommend the product."

* **No new information:**  Alice still has no way to signal the quality of the product to Bob.
* **Bob is extremely cautious:**  Bob has had a very consistent string of low-quality products. He's learned to expect the worst and is highly unlikely to trust any recommendation at this point.

Alice has no way to change Bob's perception, and even if she did, Bob's skepticism is justified based on the history of the transaction."
