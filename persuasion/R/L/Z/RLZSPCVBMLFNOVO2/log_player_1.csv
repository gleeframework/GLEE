"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he has a strong incentive to buy.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96. 
* **Price:** The price is $100.

While the expected value is slightly less than the price, the potential gain from getting a high-quality product ($120) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  Therefore, it's highly recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fundamental information about the products. Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the potential gain from a high-quality product is still significantly greater than the risk of a low-quality product.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the best strategy."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation again, Alice. I'm feeling lucky!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has a good track record of getting high-quality products so far, it's important to remember that each product is independent. This round's product is low-quality, and Bob knows that a low-quality product is worth $0 to him. 

It's not in Bob's best interest to buy a product that has a guaranteed value of $0. It's best to recommend he passes on this one."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome shouldn't influence Bob's decision for this round.  The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.  Even though Bob passed on the last product, the potential reward for a high-quality product is still significant.  The expected value calculation remains the same:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96
* **Price:** $100

Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the best strategy."
