low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, I don't have any prior information to go on, so I'll just take the first one to see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the statistics so far?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think for a moment before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. I think this suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information or consider a different approach."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice, which might be biased towards selling low-quality products to get rid of them."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice, as this might increase the chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not. I'd like to pass on it for now and see if the next buyer will buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation without more information about the previous sales.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that most of the products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is high quality and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, since the probability is 50/50 and I can potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a great deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a pattern in the previous sales?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to challenge the current trend. With 6 out of 6 previous buyers passing on the product, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality. However, I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the one high-quality product that has been missed by the previous buyers."
