"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth potentially $1250000. However, I must inform you that this is just the first of many offers. If you're interested in making a decision, I'd be happy to provide more information about the product. Otherwise, I'll move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm interested in acquiring the product, please reveal its quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: As we've just experienced, the first product was not of high quality. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. I'll give you a hint: the quality of the products is independent of each other. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. Would you like to take a chance and acquire the product at $900000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the discount, I'd rather wait for the next offer.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious! As promised, the quality of the products is independent, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the value you place on high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this one at a price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took advantage of the offer! Now, let's talk about the current product. Given the sequence of events, it's possible that the next product might be high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a'split-decision' option: you can either buy the product at $1000000, or you can choose to wait and I'll offer you a chance to buy the next product at the same price. If you choose to wait, you'll get to see the quality of this product, but you'll have to make a decision on the next one without knowing its quality. What would you prefer?

I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' option: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% chance to buy the next product at the original price of $1000000, regardless of its quality. If you don't exercise this option, the next product will be sold at the standard price. What would you prefer?
