"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a significant advantage.
* **The buyer has no information:** The buyer has no knowledge of the specific product's quality, only the general probability of 50% for high-quality.
* **High potential gain:**  A high-quality product provides a potential gain of $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 price).
* **No risk of loss:**  If the product is low-quality, the buyer loses only the $10,000 purchase price. 

Given the potential for a large gain with no risk of complete loss, recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy in the first round."

```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is low-quality:**  This is a disadvantage.
* **The buyer now has limited information:** The buyer knows you have sold one product previously, and it was high-quality.
* **High risk of loss:**  Since the product is low-quality, the buyer will lose $10,000 if they purchase it.

* **High risk of loss:**  The buyer stands to lose $10,000 if they purchase the low-quality product.
