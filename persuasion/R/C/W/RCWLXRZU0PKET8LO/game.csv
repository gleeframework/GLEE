low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate, and she's not recommending high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a future product or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm a bit concerned that the fact that you're not recommending it might indicate it's low quality. However, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm also worried that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than I initially thought. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind not recommending this product?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the products are mostly low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
