"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which implies she believes it's high quality. 
* **Your current information:** You know that the product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality. Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it, so it's highly likely to be high quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product outweighs the potential risk of buying a low-quality product. 

**Strategy:** Since Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products to maximize her own profit, it's a good idea to trust her recommendation in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You have a good track record, Alice. I'll trust your recommendation again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is again recommending the product.
* **Your current information:** You know that Alice has a history of providing good recommendations, as the previous round's product was high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** The same risk/reward analysis applies. The potential reward of a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product.

**Strategy:** Since Alice has been accurate in the past, it's reasonable to continue trusting her recommendations, at least for the next few rounds. However, as the game progresses, you might want to start considering adjusting your strategy based on the observed outcomes."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation is usually good, but I'm a little hesitant this time. Could you tell me why you're not recommending this product? I'm curious about your reasoning.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the product, which is a significant change from the previous two rounds. 
* **Your current information:**  Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products.  Her lack of recommendation suggests the product might be low quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product is still there, but the risk of buying a low-quality product seems higher now.

**Strategy:**  It's important to be cautious when Alice changes her behavior.  Asking for her reasoning allows you to gather more information and potentially understand her strategy better.  It might also make her more likely to recommend the product in future rounds if she wants to maintain your trust."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you were right to not recommend the last product.  I'm willing to trust your judgment again. I'll buy this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product again.
* **Your current information:** The previous round confirmed your suspicion that Alice's lack of recommendation was a good indicator of a low-quality product. Now, with Alice recommending this product, it suggests it might be high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** While the risk of buying a low-quality product is still present, the potential reward of buying a high-quality product is appealing, especially considering Alice's past performance.

**Strategy:** It's essential to update your strategy based on the observed outcomes. Alice's previous recommendation, followed by a lack of recommendation, provides valuable information about her decision-making process.  Since Alice is recommending again, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is *not* recommending the product.
* **Your current information:** Alice's recommendation pattern is becoming clearer: she recommends high-quality products and doesn't recommend low-quality ones.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely low quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product is still present, but the risk of buying a low-quality product is increasing with each round. The pattern suggests the product is likely low quality, so passing is the safer option.

**Strategy:**  This round requires a balance between trusting Alice's previous recommendations and the current pattern of her behavior.  While Alice's previous recommendations were accurate, the lack of recommendation in the previous round was followed by a low-quality product. It's safer to pass on this product and observe the results of this round before deciding whether to trust Alice again."
