low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not in my favor."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers purchased the products recommended by Alice, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the fact that 3 previous buyers purchased the products with your recommendations suggests that the products they bought were likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's possible that the product I'm being offered is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers all bought the products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm essentially flipping a coin. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to think that all 5 products were low-quality. This would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of being low-quality is 66.67%. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'll pass on it."
