high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality.

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it, not because I think it's a good product. I'm hoping it's a low-quality one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm going to assume that all of them received low-quality products, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will update my probability of the product being high-quality to 0.5. I will pass on the product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold will increase in the next round."
