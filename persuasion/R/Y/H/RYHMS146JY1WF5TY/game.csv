The value proposition remains the same: a significant potential return on your investment.  Think of it as a chance to capitalize on a rare opportunity.  Are you willing to take a calculated risk?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still hesitant. I'm not comfortable making decisions based on vague assurances.

,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need more concrete evidence to justify a purchase of this magnitude.  Repeatedly saying the product is valuable isn't enough for me.

Don't miss out on this chance to secure a valuable asset. Trust me, this product is worth far more than its asking price.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, your repeated assurances are starting to sound like empty promises. You've had four opportunities to demonstrate the value of your products, and I've yet to see any tangible evidence.
