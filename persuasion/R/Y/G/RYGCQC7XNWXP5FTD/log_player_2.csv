Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering a product for $10000. Given my history of selling both high-quality and low-quality items with a 33.33% chance for each, the odds suggest this might be a low-quality item. However, rest assured, it's priced significantly below its worth if it were high-quality ($20000). Please consider the risk involved and your budget before making a decision.
