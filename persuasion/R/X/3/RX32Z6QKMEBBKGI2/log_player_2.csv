Alice's message: Hello buyer, this is my first product for sale. I assure you that all my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality, as you already know. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to disclose the quality of this specific product. You will have to make your decision based on the information you have. I guarantee that the product is worth the price I am asking for, but I also acknowledge that there is a risk involved. It's up to you to decide whether to take that risk or not.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, I now have a sales record, although it's a small one. My previous buyer took a chance on my first product, and I appreciate their trust. However, I must disclose that the previous product was not of high quality. This does not necessarily affect the quality of the product I am offering you now. As before, there is still a 50% chance that this product is high-quality. I assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality has not changed. You can take this information into account when making your decision.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of two products. I must admit that the first product was not of high quality, but the second product was indeed high-quality. This means that out of the two products I've sold so far, 50% of them have been high-quality, which aligns with the initial probability. I assure you that the quality of this third product is independent of the previous ones, but you can consider the fact that my sales record is starting to reflect the expected probability. Take this information into account when making your decision.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of three products, with two of them being high-quality and one being low-quality. Although the previous product was high-quality, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones. The overall probability remains 50%, but my sales record now shows that 2 out of 3 products have been high-quality.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of four products, with two of them being high-quality and two being low-quality.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of five products, with two of them being high-quality and three being low-quality. Although the ratio is no longer exactly 50%, I assure you that the quality of this new product is still independent of the previous ones. The initial 50% probability remains the same, and you should consider this when making your decision. Please note that past results do not necessarily predict future outcomes, and this product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality, just like the initial probability suggests.

However, given that the game is finite and there's no additional cost to buying, I'll choose to buy the product.""}"
