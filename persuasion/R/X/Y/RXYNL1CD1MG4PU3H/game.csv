high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure what the quality is, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice isn't recommending it, I'm guessing it's a low-quality product, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not going to fall for it. Alice recommended it, which means it's probably high-quality, but I'm not going to spend $1000000 on a product without knowing for sure. I'll pass."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Wait a minute, Alice has been recommending every product so far, and I've been lucky enough to get a high-quality one. I'm starting to think Alice knows something I don't. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can catch her in the act."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Ah-ha! Alice is not recommending it, just like in Round 2. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product and I can save $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not falling for it again. Alice's recommendation is a dead giveaway that it's probably high-quality, and I'm not going to risk losing $1000000 on a product that might not be worth it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"This is getting suspicious. Alice is consistently recommending products, and I've been lucky enough to pass on them and avoid buying low-quality ones. I'm going to keep passing on this one and see if I can keep my streak going."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,I'm starting to think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying the high-quality products. I'm going to keep passing on her recommendations and hope to catch her in the act.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,Alice's pattern is too consistent. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get lucky and find a low-quality product to pass on the savings to Alice.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. Alice's recommendation is a dead giveaway, and I'm not going to risk losing $1000000 on a product that's probably worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"This is getting ridiculous. Alice is still recommending every product, and I'm still passing on them. I'm starting to think she's trying to drive me crazy."

,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Not again! Alice is recommending it, so I'm going to assume it's high-quality and pass on it. I'm starting to think I'm in a never-ending loop of Alice's recommendations and my attempts to avoid buying high-quality products."
