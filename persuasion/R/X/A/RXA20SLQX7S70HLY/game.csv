,,Alice,1,"You're getting a great deal! This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a unique opportunity to be one of my first customers and help me establish a reputation. I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'll need to think carefully about it before making a final decision. Can you tell me more about your sales record and the quality of the products you're offering?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious! I'd be happy to share my sales record with you. Out of 2 products sold so far, 0 are high-quality. I'm looking to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. This one is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's similar to the one you just passed on.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $12500 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a bold one! I appreciate your confidence. Just to give you some context, my sales record now shows 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold. I'm still looking to clear out inventory and make room for new products. This one is priced at $10000, and I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to make a serious offer.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to make a serious offer. Given the low sales record and the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your business acumen! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate on the price of $10000 for this product. As you can see from my sales record, I've had a bit of a rough start, but I'm confident that this product is a gem. It's one of the few high-quality ones I have in stock, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. If you're interested, it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price compared to what it's worth.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $10000. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your skepticism! I'd like to share some additional information with you. Out of the 4 products I've sold so far, 1 is high-quality. I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product, which is worth significantly more than the asking price of $10000. I'm willing to provide a certificate of authenticity, which will guarantee the product's quality. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm interested in the certificate of authenticity and the potential value of a high-quality product. However, I'd like to clarify that I'll only pay $10000 for it, as that's the original price you're offering.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're interested in the high-quality products I have to offer! However, this product is not one of them. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you, and I'll make sure to clearly label it as a low-quality product. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be an opportunity to get a product at a discounted price, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your preference for high-quality products. However, I want to remind you that the odds of a product being high-quality are 33.33%, and you've already seen that 3 out of 6 products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy it, I'll give you a free consultation on how to get the most out of a low-quality product. It might not be the best product, but it could still be useful to you.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. With only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to point out that the odds of a product being high-quality are still 33.33%, and you've seen that 4 out of 7 products sold so far have been low-quality. However, I'm willing to offer you a different perspective: even if this product is low-quality, it's still a valuable learning experience, and you can use it as a reference point for future purchases. I'll give you a 10% discount on the original price, making it $9000. This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price and gain some insight into my sales record.",

This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 25% (3 high-quality products out of 12 total products sold).
