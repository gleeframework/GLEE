low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, which is 1/3 of the product's potential value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of the previous buyer purchased, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and I'm hoping that if you're not recommending it, it might be a high-quality product that you don't want to sell to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which suggests that the product may be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product has a better chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what your criteria for recommending or not recommending a product are. Are you looking for a certain number of high-quality products sold before making a recommendation, or is there another factor at play?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is no, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on it for now."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of this product being high quality is 50%, but given the previous buyers' decisions, I'm inclined to think it's more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if it's low quality, it would be a waste of money, and if it's high quality, I'm not sure I want to take the risk of buying it after seeing the previous 5 buyers passed on it."

,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation and the statistics, as none of the previous 6 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, which suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality."
