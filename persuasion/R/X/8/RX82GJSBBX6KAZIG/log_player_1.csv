"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and they are offered the product for $1,000,000, they are faced with a gamble:

* **If the product is high-quality:** They make a profit of $4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000.
* **If the product is low-quality:** They lose $1,000,000.

The expected value of this gamble is:

(0.5 * $3,000,000) + (0.5 * -$1,000,000) = $1,000,000 - $500,000 = $500,000

While the expected value is positive, it's still a significant risk. A rational buyer would likely choose not to buy, as the potential loss is substantial compared to the potential gain.  

**Note:** This is a purely rational decision based on the information provided. In reality, a buyer's decision might be influenced by other factors like risk tolerance, trust in the seller, and their own financial situation."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is the same as in Round 1.  The buyer still has no information about the quality of the product and faces the same gamble:

* **High-quality:** $3,000,000 profit
* **Low-quality:** $1,000,000 loss

The expected value is still $500,000, but the buyer has even less information to go on than before. There's no record of past sales to indicate the seller might be more likely to offer high-quality products.  

Therefore, a rational buyer would still choose not to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but given the lack of information and the fact that no products have been sold yet, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
