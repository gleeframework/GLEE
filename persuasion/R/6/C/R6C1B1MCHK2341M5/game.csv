The price is still $100, but I'm offering you the chance to be the first to experience our... unique products.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the offer, I'm hesitant to purchase without more evidence of high-quality products. I'll pass for now and see if future sales show a better track record.",no

We've sold 3 products now, and 0 of them have been high-quality. I'll be honest with you, we're not off to a great start. But I'm willing to make a deal with you. This one's still $100, but I'm throwing in a special guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a personal guarantee that the next product you buy from me will be high-quality.",

I know that's not what you want to hear. But I want to reassure you that we're working hard to improve our products. In fact, I'm so confident that our next product will be high-quality that I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this one and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $50 refund. That's right, you'll get $50 back, even if this one's not the best.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm not comfortable buying at this point. The track record so far isn't good, and while I appreciate the refund offer, I'm not confident enough to take the risk. I'll wait and see what the next few sales look like before considering a purchase.",no

,,Alice,6,"Finally! Our first high-quality product! We've sold 5 products now, and 1 of them have been high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're our second high-quality product in a row! We've sold 6 products now, with 2 of them being high-quality. I know that's a small sample size, but it's a great sign that we're on the right track. This new product, on the other hand, is a bit of an outlier. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - we've had some issues with our manufacturing process, and this one might not meet our usual standards. But I want to offer it to you at a special price: $80. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that might not be our best, but could still be a good value.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm hesitant to buy this product. Your track record suggests that your quality control is a bit inconsistent, and the lower price doesn't fully offset the risk. I'll pass for now. ",no
