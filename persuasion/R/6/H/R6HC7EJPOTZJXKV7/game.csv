I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a second discount: if you buy this one and the next one, I'll give you a total of $2000 off.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're excited about the discounts! However, I have to warn you that the next product I have is a bit of a wild card. I'm not sure what it's going to be, but I can tell you that it's not as high-quality as the last few ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm only offering this one product at this price because I think you'll be able to take advantage of the discount on the next one. If you're feeling lucky, go for it! If not, I can move on to the next one.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll be honest with you, I'm not as confident in this one as I am in the high-quality products. If you're feeling adventurous, go for it! If not, I can move on to the next one.",
