A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first product was low-quality and the buyer bought it, the buyer now knows that I have at least 1 low-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the buyer can infer that I have at least 1/5 of my products as low-quality.

However, since this product is high-quality, I now have 2 products in total, and at least 1 of them is low-quality. The buyer can infer that I have 1 high-quality product and at least 1 low-quality product.

The buyer also knows that I have sold 1 product, which is low-quality. The probability that the next product is high-quality is 80%, but the buyer might be cautious since they know I have at least 1 low-quality product.

I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%.

Now, I've sold 2 products, and 1 of them is low-quality. The buyer knows that I have at least 1 low-quality product and at least 1 high-quality product, and that I've sold 2 products in total.

Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the buyer can infer that I have 1.6 high-quality products on average (2 products * 0.8). However, since I've sold 2 products, and at least 1 of them is low-quality, it's possible that I have more low-quality products than high-quality ones.
