,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, but I still think the probability of this product being low-quality is 20% and the potential loss is $1000000. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was high quality, which suggests a very high probability of a high-quality product.
