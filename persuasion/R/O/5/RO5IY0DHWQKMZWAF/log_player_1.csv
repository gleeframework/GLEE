However, it's still a great product that can serve its purpose. And at $10,000, it's a steal!

Would you like to take a chance on this product and get something for your money, even if it's not the best?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a 'good enough' product at a high price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a reasonable price. Buying a low-quality product at $10000 would be a bad investment for me.

In fact, one of them even offered to vouch for the product's quality. Would you like to hear what they have to say about their experience with this product?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not swayed by the testimonials. Just because other people have bought the product and been happy with it doesn't mean I'll be happy with it.
