As for this product, I want to be upfront with you - it's not the best quality. But it's still a great opportunity to get a unique item at a fixed price of $100.

But if you're not feeling it, I'd be happy to chat with you about why I think this product might be a good value.",

But I'm hoping to redeem myself with this next product. I'm telling you straight up, this one is high-quality. I've got a good feeling about it, and I think you'll love it. I'll let you have it for $100, but I'll also throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a detailed breakdown of my sales statistics, so you can see for yourself how I've been doing. What do you say?",

That's a bit of a mixed bag, and I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm going to level with you: I'm starting to think that my sales strategy isn't working as well as I thought it was. This product is low-quality, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. But I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, just because I feel bad about my sales record. Would you like to take a chance on me for $90?",
