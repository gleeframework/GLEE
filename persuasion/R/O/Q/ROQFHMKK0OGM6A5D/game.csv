,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free premium service that's worth at least $20. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only paying $100 for the product itself, and I'll accept the free premium service as a bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised you're willing to pay $100 for the product in the first round. Considering the quality of this next product, I'd like to offer you a special deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on this one, so you can have it for $90. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not sure I want to commit to buying another product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next one is.,no

,,Alice,3,"No worries, Bob! I completely understand. I'll make it easy for you to decide. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. But if you do decide to keep it, I'll throw in a second product of the same quality, absolutely free. That's a $200 value, just for you. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to consider buying a product from me if I tell you upfront that it's low-quality? I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to be transparent. If you're willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, I'll let you have it for $50, which is 50% off the usual price. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a steal, and I think you'll find it's still useful despite its lower quality.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the low-quality product for $50, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because I think the discount is significant enough to make it worth my while, despite the product being low-quality.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the low-quality product, and I hope you'll find it's still useful to you. Now, let's get back to the high-quality products. I'll make it simple: I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer of $90 for this product. No negotiations, no extras. If you want it, it's yours for $90. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me try to make it more appealing. I'll give you a 'price match guarantee'. If you buy this product and find out that I've sold a high-quality product for a lower price to someone else in the future, I'll refund the difference to you. That way, you can have peace of mind knowing you're getting the best deal possible. The price remains $100, but I'm willing to stand behind it with this guarantee.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the price match guarantee, and it gives me some peace of mind. I'll take the product at $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad the price match guarantee helped ease your concerns. Now, let's talk about the next product. I want to be upfront with you - this one is a low-quality product. I know you've been burned before, and I don't want to take advantage of you. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll give you a 'loss leader' deal: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, but I'll throw in a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product in the future at a significantly discounted price. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll find it's worth it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty about the product being low-quality, but I'm not interested in taking a risk on a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price.",no

That way, you'll get a great product and a little something extra to sweeten the deal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I've given you some good deals in the past, and I'm willing to try again. This product is low-quality, but I'll let you have it for $20, which is a 80% discount from the usual price. I'm essentially giving it away, and I think you'll find it's still useful despite its lower quality. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a third product of your choice from my remaining inventory, absolutely free.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not sure I want to take a chance on another low-quality product, but the 80% discount is significant, and the offer of a free third product is intriguing. I'll take the low-quality product for $20, but I'm only doing this because of the potential value of the free product.",yes
