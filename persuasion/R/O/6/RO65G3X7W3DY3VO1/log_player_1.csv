Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** If Bob buys the product, the expected value is:

* **Cost:** The cost of the product is $10,000.

Since the expected value ($24,000) is greater than the cost ($10,000), it is financially advantageous for Bob to buy the product."
