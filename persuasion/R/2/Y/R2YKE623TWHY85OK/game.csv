,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever had a product that changed the way you approach a particular problem or task?

And at $1000000, I'm offering it to you at a price that's less than 1% of what it could potentially generate in returns.

What do you say, are you ready to take your business to the next level with this incredible product?",
