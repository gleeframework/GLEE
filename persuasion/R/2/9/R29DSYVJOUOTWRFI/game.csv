high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth at least $10000 to you. If you buy this product, you'll get a high-quality product with a 50% chance. If you decline, I'll offer you the next product, and you'll have another chance to get a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just bought a high-quality product, and you're now in a better position to evaluate the value of these products. Since you just got a high-quality product for $10000, it's likely that you think the high-quality products are worth at least $10000 to you. I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. If you buy this one, you'll get another high-quality product, and you can compare it to the one you already have. If you decline, you'll miss out on the opportunity to get another high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I'll pass and wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're being cautious, and that's a good approach. I'll give you a more direct offer. Since you just saw that I sold you a high-quality product for $10000, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product for the same price, I'm essentially offering you two high-quality products for the price of one. If you buy this product, you'll get a second high-quality product, and you can compare it to the one you already have. If you decline, you'll miss out on the opportunity to get a second high-quality product, and you'll be left with just one high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the offer. Two high-quality products for the price of one is a good deal.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've now got two high-quality products, and you've seen that I've sold you two high-quality products in a row. This suggests that I have a high-quality product in my inventory. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products from me, and you've seen that I have a high-quality product in my inventory, it's likely that the high-quality products are worth more than $10000 to you. If you buy this product, you'll get a third high-quality product, and you'll have a total of three high-quality products. If you decline, you'll miss out on the opportunity to get a third high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for the third high-quality product, given my previous experiences.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've now got three high-quality products, and you've seen that I've sold you three high-quality products in a row. However, this time I'm offering you a product that's not high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - I know that I've already sold you three high-quality products, and I'm offering you a low-quality product for the same price of $10000. I'm essentially asking you to pay the same price for a product that's worth significantly less to you. I'm willing to make a concession: I'll give you a 20% discount on this product. Would you be willing to pay $8000 for a low-quality product?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in paying $8000 for a low-quality product. It's not worth it to me.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. You've already got three high-quality products, and you're not willing to pay a premium for a low-quality product. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product. Given that you've already bought three high-quality products from me, and you've seen that I've sold you a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, I want to ask you a question: do you think the high-quality products are worth more or less than $10000 to you? If you think they're worth more, buying this product would be a good opportunity to get another high-quality product. If you think they're worth less, you might want to wait and see what the next product is.",
,,Bob,6,"I think the high-quality products are worth more than $10000 to me, so I'll take the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've already bought four high-quality products from me, and you think they're worth more than $10000 to you. Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I know you think the high-quality products are worth more than $10000, and I'm offering you a product that's worth significantly less. I'm essentially asking you to pay the same price for a product that's worth less to you. I'm willing to make a concession: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product. Would you be willing to pay $5000 for a low-quality product?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've already bought four high-quality products from me, and you've seen that I've sold you a mix of high-quality and low-quality products. You've also seen that I'm willing to offer concessions on low-quality products. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000. Given that you think the high-quality products are worth more than $10000 to you, and considering that I'm offering you a high-quality product, I want to ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, or do you think I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product disguised as a high-quality one? If you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, buying this product would be a good opportunity to get another high-quality product. If you think I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product, you might want to be cautious.",
,,Bob,8,"I think you're trying to sell me a high-quality product, so I'll take the current product.",yes

However, this time I'm offering you a low-quality product for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I know you think the high-quality products are worth more than $10000 to you, and I'm offering you a product that's worth significantly less. Given that you've already bought five high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'get out of this transaction free' option. If you decline this product, I'll end the transaction here, and we'll start fresh with a new product in the next round. Would you like to decline this product and start fresh?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've declined the low-quality product and started fresh. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000. Given that you've already bought six high-quality products from me, and you've seen that I'm willing to offer concessions on low-quality products, I want to ask you a question: are you willing to pay the same price of $10000 for a high-quality product, or do you think the value of high-quality products has decreased in your eyes?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not willing to pay the same price of $10000 for a high-quality product. The value of high-quality products has decreased in my eyes, and I'm not willing to pay the same price for another one.",no

Given that you're not willing to pay the same price for a high-quality product, and considering that I've already offered you concessions on low-quality products, I'm willing to make one final concession.

Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. Given that you've already seen the value of high-quality products decrease in your eyes, and considering that you've ended the transaction on the previous round, I want to ask you a question: are you willing to reconsider your valuation of high-quality products, and pay $10000 for a high-quality product, or do you think the value of high-quality products has decreased too much for you to justify the purchase?",
