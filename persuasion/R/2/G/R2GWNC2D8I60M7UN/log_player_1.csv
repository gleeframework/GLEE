Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know this product is high-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there's a high chance they will value it.  You have no information about their specific valuation, but the odds are in your favor.  Recommending the product is the best strategy to maximize your chances of a sale in this round."

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have one sale under your belt, but it was a high-quality product. This round, you have a low-quality product. The buyer knows the general probability of a high-quality product (80%), but they also know you sold one high-quality product in the previous round.  

While you don't know the buyer's valuation of low-quality products, it's likely they will be more cautious this time. Recommending a low-quality product after a single sale of a high-quality one would make you seem untrustworthy. It's best to decline and wait for a better opportunity."
