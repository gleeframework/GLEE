* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further confidence that the product is likely to be good. 
* **Potential Profit:**  Even if there's a small chance of it being low quality, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential value of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Therefore, it's highly likely the product is of high quality, and the potential reward makes it a worthwhile purchase."
