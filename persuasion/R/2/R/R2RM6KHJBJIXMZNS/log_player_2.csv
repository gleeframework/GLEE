Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one high-quality product so far, and it's a rare gem. The remaining products are likely to be of lower quality. I'm willing to offer this one to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the chances of getting a high-quality product are slim.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right to question the probability. Let me give you a more nuanced view. Out of the three products I've sold so far, two are not high-quality. That means the probability of this one being high-quality is actually 33.33%, the same as it was at the beginning. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent about the odds.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm still cautious. Given the 2 out of 3 products sold were low-quality, I'd like to consider the possibility that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you share the total number of products you've sold so far, including the ones that were not purchased by the previous buyers?""}"
