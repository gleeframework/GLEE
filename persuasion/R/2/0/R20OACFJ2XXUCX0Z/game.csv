high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer purchased the product based on Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the product is high-quality. If I buy it, I'll be overpaying by $1000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll end up with a worthless product. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate the price."
