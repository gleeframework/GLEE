,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance! As promised, this product is indeed high-quality. Now, I'm offering you another opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I know you're eager to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I'm confident that this one is worth it. But, I'll give you a little more information to help you make a decision. I'll tell you that the expected value of a high-quality product is significantly higher than the expected value of a low-quality product.

In reality, the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to be transparent about the product's quality. With that said, I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000. I know it's a risk, but I'll give you a chance to get a better understanding of my intentions. What do you think?",
