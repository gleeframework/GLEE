"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** The buyer has no information about the product's quality beyond the general 50% chance it's high. 
* **High Price:** The price is fixed at $100, and the buyer doesn't know the potential value of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The buyer is taking a 50/50 gamble.  There's a chance of getting a high-quality product worth more than $100, but also a chance of getting a low-quality product that may be worth less. 

**Strategy:** As a seller, I want to encourage sales, especially in the first round.  Recommending a purchase gives the buyer the chance to experience the product and potentially find its value, leading to future sales."
