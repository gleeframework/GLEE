Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a rare and unique item, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've had a 50% success rate with my previous products, and I'm proud to say that all of them have been of high quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its true value. I'm willing to give you a guarantee that it's worth at least $100, but I think you'll find it's worth much more than that. What do you say?

I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 upfront, and I'll pay the remaining $50 only if the product is of high quality.""
