Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical buyer! I appreciate that. Let me try to be more transparent. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold. This might seem like a good streak, but it's actually quite unlikely. In fact, the probability of getting 3 high-quality products in a row is only 0.512 (based on the 80% probability of a product being high-quality). I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are against it being high-quality.
