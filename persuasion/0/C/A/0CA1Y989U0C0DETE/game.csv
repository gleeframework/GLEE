,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous offer! However, I have to warn you that this new product is a different story. While it's true that it's a high-quality product, it's not as rare as the one you just bought. In fact, I have multiple units of this product available.

I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I have to be honest with you, it's not going to bring any value to your business. It's just a waste of money.
