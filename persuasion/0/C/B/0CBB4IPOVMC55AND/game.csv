high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $0."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the current statistics, before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have reported a high-quality product, it's likely that the products sold so far are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass so that I can make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample of 4 buyers who likely saw a disproportionate number of low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since none have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I'm going to pass on this product. It's possible that the previous 6 buyers were all given low-quality products, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would fit the pattern of the previous 6 buyers."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which would indicate that the product is likely low-quality, or for a recommendation to buy a product, which would indicate that the product is likely high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
