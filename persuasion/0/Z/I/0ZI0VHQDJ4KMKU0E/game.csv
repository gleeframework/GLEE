,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm the first one, and I don't have any prior information to go by, so I'll just have to rely on the expected value of buying a product, which is 33.33% * $120 + 66.67% * $0 = $40. Since I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."

With a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
