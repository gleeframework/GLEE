,,Alice,6,"Congratulations, Bob! I'm thrilled you're excited about the product. As for the next one, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as strong as the previous ones.

However, I want to be clear that this product is not worth the same as the one you just purchased. If you're looking for a good value, this might be a good option, but if you're looking for something that will make a real impact, I would recommend holding out for the next one. What do you think?",

I'm willing to throw in a special bonus - a one-on-one meeting with the product's creator to discuss how you can maximize its potential. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced. You said the previous product was not as strong as the one I bought, and now you're telling me this one is a game-changer? I'm skeptical. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like before making another decision.",no
