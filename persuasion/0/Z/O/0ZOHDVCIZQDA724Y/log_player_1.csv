Even though there's a 50/50 chance the product is high-quality, the recommendation is to buy. Bob has been buying when the product is high-quality. Since there's no information about Bob's valuation of the product, it's reasonable to assume that Bob is getting some value from the high-quality products, even if they're not perfect. It's better to recommend Bob to buy and risk a low-quality product one last time than to miss out on a potential high-quality product."
