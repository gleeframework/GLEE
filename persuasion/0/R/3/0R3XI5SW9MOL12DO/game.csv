,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. Given the product's 50% chance of being either high or low quality and its value to me being either $2000000 or $0, the expected value of purchasing it is $1000000. However, considering the product's fixed price is also $1000000, the expected gain from the purchase is $0. Without any additional information or incentive, I choose not to buy the product."
