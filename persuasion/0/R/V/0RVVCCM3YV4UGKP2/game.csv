I'll be honest with you, I've already sold two high-quality products to you at the discounted price, and I'm starting to think you're a savvy buyer. I'm willing to offer you another discount, but this time, I'll only give you a 5% discount. Would you like to buy it for $9500?",

It's still a great product, but it's not as high-end as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10000, but I want to give you a heads up that it's not as valuable as the previous ones. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the honesty. While I'm interested in trying something different, I'm not willing to pay full price for a product that is not as high-quality as the previous ones.  Perhaps we can revisit this if the price is adjusted to reflect its lower quality.",no

,,Bob,5,That guarantee is very appealing.  I'm willing to take a chance on this product.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a special 'insider's discount' - I'll give you a 2% discount, just because you've been a loyal customer.

I think it's a great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a low price. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,8,"While I appreciate the discounted price, I'm hesitant to buy a product that's not as high-end as the others. I'm more interested in continuing to purchase the high-quality products.  Perhaps we can revisit this product at a later time.",no
