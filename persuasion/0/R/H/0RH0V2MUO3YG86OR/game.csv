high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm skeptical that this one will be any different. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and with no high-quality products sold so far, it's more likely that this product is low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it, but based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. It's likely that the products being sold are low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%.
