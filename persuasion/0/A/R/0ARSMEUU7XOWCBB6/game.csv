,,Alice,2,no,

,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just a way to manipulate me, and I should just ignore them. I'll keep buying when she doesn't recommend, hoping that I'll get lucky eventually."
