high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous buyers, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you share the total number of products you've offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products you've offered?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000 on a worthless item."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the one high-quality product that hasn't been sold yet."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of the products were high quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased, making it less likely that this product is high quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm guessing the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%?"
