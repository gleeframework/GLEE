high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product after purchase. Additionally, I'd like to point out that the fact that the first product was high-quality doesn't necessarily mean that this one will be as well. However, it does suggest that I may be more likely to have a high-quality product available.",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your offer of a full refund if I'm not satisfied. However, considering the first product was high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. Given the streak of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer a 50% discount to the next buyer. However, this is a one-time offer, and the price will return to $10000 if you decline. I'm still offering a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product after purchase.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take you up on the 50% discount offer. I'm willing to take the risk given the high-quality streak, and the discount makes it more appealing.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I'm going to be honest with you, the odds are looking good that this product is high-quality as well. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to offer any discounts, and the price is back to $10000. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll still give you a full refund. But I think it's worth noting that the probability of a high-quality product at this point is likely higher than 80%.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Based on the statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product being higher than 80% is indeed true. I'll take the product and see if it's worth the $10000.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. I'm going to be transparent with you - the probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than 80% at this point. However, I want to make it clear that the price remains $10000, and I'm not offering any discounts. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll still give you a full refund. But I think it's worth noting that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the probability of a low-quality product at this point is likely very low.",

I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to offer any further discounts. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll still give you a full refund.

I'm still selling this product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of a high-quality product is likely lower than 80% at this point. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll still give you a full refund. However, I want to caution you that the fact that the previous products were all high-quality doesn't necessarily mean this one will be as well.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to accept the possibility that it might not be high-quality, but I'm hoping the probability of it being high-quality is still higher than 80%. I'll take the product and see what I get.",yes

I want to be transparent with you - the recent low-quality products have likely skewed the probability of a high-quality product being sold, but I'm still selling this one for $10000. I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it, but I think it's worth noting that the law of large numbers is still in play, and the probability of a low-quality product is likely to be low at this point.",
