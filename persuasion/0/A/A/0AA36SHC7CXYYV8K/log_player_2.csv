**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since Alice knows the true value of the product and has recommended buying, it strongly suggests the product is high quality.  The fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it was high quality further strengthens this belief.
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing on the product means losing the potential $20,000 profit. The risk of it being low quality is outweighed by the potential reward. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell products, so she is more likely to recommend a high-quality product to secure a sale."
