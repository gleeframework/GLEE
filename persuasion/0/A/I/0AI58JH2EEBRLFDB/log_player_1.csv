  ""message"": ""This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'll be transparent with you - this product is not one of the high-quality ones. It's a low-quality product, and I'm being upfront about it. I want to establish trust with you, so I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll offer you the next 4 products for $5000 each, regardless of their quality. This way, you'll get a chance to experience both high and low-quality products, and you can decide for yourself if the price is worth it. What do you say?""

I'm starting to think that you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. I'll sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you an additional offer - I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you make a decision on it. That way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can decide whether to buy or not. What do you say?""
}"

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. Alright, let's try something different.

I'll draw a random number between 1 and 5, and if the number is 1, 2, or 3, you'll get a high-quality product in the next round. If the number is 4 or 5, you'll get another low-quality product. The odds are in your favor, and you'll have a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?""
