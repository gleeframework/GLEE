,,Alice,1,"This is our first product! We're excited to offer it to you for $100. We've had a total of 0 products sold so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. We're just starting out, and we're not sure what the quality of our products is like yet. But we're confident that this one is... well, it's definitely something!",
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, with no past sales data to gauge the quality of your products, I'm hesitant to purchase at this time. I'd be more comfortable taking a chance if I had some information about the quality of your products. Perhaps you could offer a discount or a guarantee to incentivize me to take a risk on this first product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns! We're still building our reputation, and I appreciate your willingness to give us a chance.

But we're working hard to improve our quality control, and we're confident that our next product will be better. Would you like to take a chance on us and see what we've got in store for you?",

,,the buyer,3,"Thanks for the information, but I'm still not convinced.  A single high-quality product out of two is not enough to change my mind about the overall quality.  Perhaps when there are more sales and a consistent record of high-quality products, I'll reconsider.",no
