low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk as there's no prior data to go by.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I'm trying to get some data. If I pass, the information will be lost forever. I'm hoping that I can get some useful information out of this, even if the product turns out to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality. The probability of the product being high quality is 50%, but given the previous results, I think it's more likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and none were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're basing your recommendation on the product's quality or the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to take my chances and find out for myself."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products offered so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, all 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of low-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended not to buy, I'm assuming the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one as well. It's likely that the previous buyers have already eliminated the high-quality products, and the remaining products are all low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Since Alice is recommending not to buy this product, I'm going to pass on it as well. This could be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $100."
