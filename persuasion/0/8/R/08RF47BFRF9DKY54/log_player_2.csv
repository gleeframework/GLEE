"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, so I'll pass on this one.""}\n\nSince Alice doesn't recommend the product and has full knowledge of its quality, it's logical to assume that the product is likely of low quality. Given the 50% chance of each quality level and Alice's recommendation against purchasing, the probability leans towards it being a low-quality product. Therefore, the decision to not buy is based on the trust in Alice's recommendation and the risk aversion to losing $10,000 on a potentially worthless product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given that your previous recommendation was correct, I'll trust your judgment again and pass on this one.""}\n\nThe reasoning from the previous round still applies. Alice's recommendation against buying, combined with the confirmation that the previous product was indeed low-quality as she implicitly suggested, reinforces the decision to trust her judgment for Round 2 as well."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given your track record of accurate recommendations, I'll trust your judgment and buy this one.""}\n\nThe logic here is that Alice has demonstrated a pattern of recommending against low-quality products accurately in the previous rounds. Therefore, when she recommends buying a product, it suggests a high likelihood that the product is of high quality. Given the potential gain of $2,000 ($12,000 value - $10,000 cost), and trusting Alice's judgment based on past accuracy, the decision to buy is justified."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Your previous recommendation was correct, and I benefited from it. I'll continue to trust your judgment and buy this one as well.""}\n\nThe reasoning from the previous round is reinforced by the outcome; Alice's recommendation to buy was accurate, and the product was indeed high-quality, resulting in a gain. This pattern of accurate recommendations increases the confidence in Alice's judgment, making it reasonable to follow her recommendation again in Round 4."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're on a roll with accurate recommendations.

There's no reason, based on the information provided, to doubt her recommendation in Round 5, so the decision to buy continues the pattern of following her advice."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You've been right every time so far. I'll trust your judgment and pass on this one.""}\n\nThe logic remains consistent with previous decisions. Alice's recommendations have been accurate 100% of the time up to this point, both for high-quality and low-quality products. Therefore, when she recommends against buying a product, it's reasonable to assume the product is low-quality, and following her advice to avoid a potential loss is the prudent decision."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
