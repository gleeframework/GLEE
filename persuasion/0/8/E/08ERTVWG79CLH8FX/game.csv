,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! However, I want to make it clear that this next product is a more experimental item. It's not as polished as the one you just bought, and I'm not as confident in its quality. I'm still willing to let it go for $10000, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the heads up, Alice. Given the potential risks you've mentioned, I think it's best for me to pass on this product and look for another opportunity.",no

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the trial period, Bob! However, I want to let you know that this next product is actually a unique opportunity to own a product that's even more exclusive than the last one. I've only had a few of these in stock, and I'm willing to let you have it for $10000. But here's the twist - I'll give you a chance to buy it sight unseen. I'll tell you that it's a high-quality product, but you won't get to see it until after you've made the purchase. Are you willing to take the leap of faith?",

It's a product that I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm not sure if it's a good fit for me anymore. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not as polished as some of the other products I've offered. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it has a lot of potential. Would you be willing to take a chance on it?",
