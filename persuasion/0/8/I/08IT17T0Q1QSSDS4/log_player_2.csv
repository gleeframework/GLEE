**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from previous sales, which is insufficient to draw strong conclusions.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a significant factor. Since she knows the product's quality, her recommendation holds weight, even without strong statistical evidence.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential upside of getting a high-quality product ($300 value) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0 value).

**Overall:** While the lack of data makes it a gamble, Alice's recommendation and the potential for a high-quality product make it a worthwhile risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm happy to buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is significantly higher than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This suggests she believes the product is high quality, making it more likely to be worthwhile. 
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing on the product means missing out on a potentially high-value item. The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward."
