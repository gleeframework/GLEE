,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information about the quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm not inclined to buy the product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality and the expected value of buying it, considering the current statistics."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you reveal the product's quality after I buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Since 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, I'm assuming the product is low quality, which would make sense given Alice's recommendation. Can you confirm the probability of the product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm skeptical about the product quality given your previous recommendations to other buyers were ignored by them. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all 3 products sold so far were low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if Alice will recommend it to the next buyer."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy it. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products being sold are likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy this product. Is it because you think it's low quality based on past sales data?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be higher than the 33.33% chance, making the expected value of buying the product higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 3 buyers, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold to them. This will help me make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality product has been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might mean that it's a low-quality product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
