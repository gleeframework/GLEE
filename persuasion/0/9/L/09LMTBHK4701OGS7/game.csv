,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively low based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that we might be in a bad period, or Alice might be selecting a biased sample.
