This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

As a rational economic agent, Bob should always buy a high-quality product if the price is less than or equal to its value to him. Since we don't know Bob's valuation of a high-quality product, we cannot say for sure whether he'll find it worth buying. However, since the product is high-quality, there's a chance it might be worth more than $10,000 to him.  Therefore, it's recommended to buy it."
