{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the product!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has perfect information:** She knows the quality of the product. 
* **Recommendation is valuable:** Since Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is a strong signal. Even if there's a 50/50 chance the product is good, Alice's recommendation suggests it's likely high quality.
