,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're not interested, I'll offer you another one in the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in this one, please show me the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This is the second low-quality product in a row. I'm starting to wonder if you're not interested in my products at all. I'm still offering it to you for $100. If you're not interested, I'll have to think about changing my sales strategy...",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in this one either, but I'm still willing to consider your products. Please go ahead with your sales strategy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two low-quality products in a row might be a coincidence, but it's making me a bit nervous. I'll be honest with you, I have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product in the next round. If you're still interested in buying, I'll offer you this one for $100. If not, I'll keep going.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by your honesty, but I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three low-quality products in a row, and you're still waiting for the next round. I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying from me, but I'll give you one more chance. I'll offer you a deal: I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you still don't want it, I'll stop offering you products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one. I'm willing to take you up on your offer to reveal the quality of the next product, though.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll keep my promise. This product is low-quality. I've already told you that I'd reveal the quality of the next product, and I'll do it. But let me ask you, what do you think is the probability that I'd reveal the quality of a high-quality product if I had one? Would it be higher or lower than 33.33%?",
,,Bob,5,"I think the probability that you'd reveal the quality of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. If it were higher, you'd have a strong incentive to reveal it, which wouldn't make sense given your earlier statement that you have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product. So, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a clever one, Bob! You're right, if I had a high-quality product, I'd have a strong incentive to reveal it. So, the probability of me revealing the quality of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%. But, I'll keep my promise again. This product is low-quality. I'm starting to think that I'll never get to reveal the quality of a high-quality product to you... Would you like to take a chance on the next one?",
,,Bob,6,I'm glad I was able to catch on to your strategy. I'll pass on this one as well. I'm still waiting for you to reveal the quality of a high-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a loop! Four low-quality products in a row, and you're still waiting for me to reveal the quality of a high-quality product. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a discount on it. I'll sell it to you for $90. If it's low-quality, the price remains $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'm still waiting for the quality of a high-quality product to be revealed.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Ah-ha! I've finally revealed the quality of a high-quality product! This one is indeed high-quality. I'll sell it to you for $100, just like we agreed on earlier. No discount this time, but I'll make sure to reveal the quality of the next product as well. You've been patient, Bob, and I appreciate it.",

But, considering you're on a roll, I'll give you a chance to negotiate. This product is low-quality. Would you like to buy it for $80, or would you rather wait for the next one?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm glad I made a good decision on the high-quality product, but I'm not interested in buying this low-quality one for $80. I'll wait for the next one.",no

high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,

,,Bob,14,"I appreciate the final offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $20. I think I've made it clear that I'm waiting for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Alright, Bob, I think we've established a pattern here. You're looking for high-quality products, and I'm offering you low-quality ones. I'll be honest with you, I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products at this point. I'll reveal the quality of the next product, but I'm not making any promises about its quality or price. You've been patient, and I appreciate it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I think we're in a bit of a stalemate, Bob. I've offered you 16 low-quality products, and you've passed on all of them. I'm starting to think that I should just reveal the quality of the next product and be done with it. This product is low-quality. I'm not offering any discounts or negotiations this time. It's $100, take it or leave it.",

,,Alice,18,"I think we've reached the end of the game indeed, Bob. I'm shutting down the product offerings. You've won, in a sense, by waiting for the high-quality products and passing on the low-quality ones. I'll just wrap up the game here. Thanks for playing along and providing a fun challenge!",
