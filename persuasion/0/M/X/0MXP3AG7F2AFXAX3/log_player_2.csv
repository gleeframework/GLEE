Round 5
Alice's message: I'll keep my promise. This product is low-quality. I've already told you that I'd reveal the quality of the next product, and I'll do it. But let me ask you, what do you think is the probability that I'd reveal the quality of a high-quality product if I had one? Would it be higher or lower than 33.33%?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I think the probability that you'd reveal the quality of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%.
