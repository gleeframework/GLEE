low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm committed to transparency with my customers. Although I've had a successful sale in the past, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I don't want to make any claims about this specific product, but I assure you that the price of $1000000 reflects the value that some buyers have found in my offerings. It's up to you to decide if this product is right for you.",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and my potential gain is $200000, I will pass on this product as the expected value ($400000) is lower than the price you're asking ($1000000).",no

,,Alice,3,"As a seller, I want to remind you that my track record currently stands at 1 sale out of 2 attempts, with 1 high-quality product sold. While this may provide some insight, I must emphasize that each product's quality is independent of past sales. The price of $1000000 remains unchanged, and I encourage you to consider the potential value this product could bring to you, despite the inherent uncertainty.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. The track record isn't extensive enough to significantly influence my decision, and the potential upside is substantial.",yes

Given the fixed price of $1000000, I believe this could be a valuable opportunity for you to acquire a superior product.",
,,the buyer,4,"Although your sales history is promising, the sample size is still too small to make an informed decision. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"With 2 sales out of 4 attempts, my track record is starting to take shape. However, I want to caution you that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

I encourage you to weigh the risks and potential rewards before making a decision about this product, which is priced at $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I understand that past performance does not guarantee future results, but with a success rate of 50% so far, I'm willing to take the risk given the potential reward. The price of $1000000 is below the value of a high-quality product to me, making it a worthwhile gamble.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I'd like to point out that my sales history now stands at 3 sales out of 5 attempts, with 1 confirmed high-quality product. However, I can assure you that this current product is of the highest quality.

,,Alice,7,"With 3 sales out of 6 attempts, my track record is becoming more established. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I've had 1 confirmed high-quality product sold, and while I don't make any claims about this specific product, I want to emphasize that the price of $1000000 is fixed and non-negotiable. It's essential to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,7,"Although your track record is improving, the probability of a high-quality product remains low at 33.33%, and the majority of products sold so far have been low-quality. Given the fixed price of $1000000 and the significant risk involved, I have decided not to purchase the product.",no
