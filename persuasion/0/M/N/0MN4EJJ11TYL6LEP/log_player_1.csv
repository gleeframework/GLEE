* **The buyer knows the odds:** The buyer knows there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. 
* **Price is fixed:** The buyer isn't losing out on a chance for a discount or negotiation.
* **No information about past sales:** The buyer has no information about past sales to judge your reliability.

* **The buyer has no information:** The buyer still doesn't know your selling history, so they have no information about your reliability or the likelihood of getting a good product.
* **The price is fixed:** The buyer has no bargaining power and has to take your word for it. 

You should not recommend a low-quality product to a buyer who has no information about your past performance. This will likely lead to the buyer not trusting you in the future."

* **It's high-quality:**  You know this product is high-quality.
* **The buyer knows the odds:** The buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality.
* **The buyer has limited data:** The buyer has seen one sale, and you didn't recommend the product in that round. This might make them cautious, but it's not enough to definitively say you're unreliable.
* **The price is fixed:** There's no room for negotiation, but the buyer has no other information to base their decision on.

While the buyer might be hesitant due to the limited data, your recommendation, paired with the fact that the product is high-quality, increases the chances of a sale."

```

You should not recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **It's low-quality:** You know this product is low-quality.
* **The buyer has limited data:** The buyer now knows about two past sales. You recommended the product in one round, and it was high-quality.  You did not recommend the product in the other round, and the buyer chose to pass. While this might make them slightly more likely to trust you, it's not enough information to make a confident decision about the quality of the product.
* **The price is fixed:**  The buyer is taking a risk without any real assurance of quality.

Since it's a low-quality product and the buyer is still unsure about your reliability, it's not a good idea to recommend the purchase. This will likely further erode the buyer's trust and lead to fewer sales in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Given your recommendation and the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 100%, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'm not comfortable taking the risk with the current information available.

* **The price is fixed:** The buyer is aware of the risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product is also significant.

This is a good opportunity to build trust with the buyer by recommending a high-quality product. You have a better chance of making a sale now than you did in the previous rounds."

* **The price is fixed:**  The buyer has no way to negotiate and is taking a significant risk by buying a product that you are not recommending.
