high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, worth $12000 to you, at a discounted price of $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to sell a high-quality product at this price. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but only because I know it's a high-quality product 80% of the time, and the potential reward is worth the risk. I'm willing to take the gamble at this price.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase! As you know, the last product was indeed high-quality. Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity to buy a product at the same price of $10000. I can assure you that this one is also high-quality, but I'd like to make it a bit more appealing. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a special bonus worth $1000. This way, you'll get a high-quality product worth $12000 to you, and a bonus worth $1000, all for just $10000. What do you think? Will you take this deal?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality. I know the probability is 80%, but I'm not willing to take the risk at this price, especially since I already got a high-quality product in the previous round. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me a chance to buy a high-quality product without the bonus.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I appreciate your caution. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to get a great deal on a product that's still worth a lot to you, even if it's not high-quality. This product is priced at $10000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus worth $500. While it's not a high-quality product, it's still a great opportunity to get something valuable at a low price. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I know it's worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something that's essentially worthless. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product at the same price or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not high-quality. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you at an even lower price. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from its true value of $0. It's a chance to get something for free, essentially. I'm not going to offer it to anyone else at this price, so if you're interested, now's your chance. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, no matter how low the price is. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
