high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 7th buyer and she wants to make a sale."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I suspect that you may be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who purchase. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
