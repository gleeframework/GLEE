low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,I'll take my chances since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and your previous recommendation resulted in a high-quality product being sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential gain is higher than the cost.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but since only 1 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, and you're recommending I buy, I'm assuming you're trying to get rid of a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd rather not take the risk given the relatively low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'll pass, since you don't recommend it and the stats aren't convincing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy it since you don't recommend it and the odds are 50/50, also the previous sales record doesn't look promising with only 1 out of 3 products being high quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential gain is $2000.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and Alice recommends it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,I'll take my chances since the recommendation rate has been fairly reliable so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,I'll take my chances since the recommendation rate is decent and high-quality products have been sold in the past.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential gain is higher than the cost.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"The probability of the product being high quality is 50%, but based on the sales record, only 3 out of 8 products sold were high quality, which is less than the expected 50%. I'm not convinced that this product is likely to be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I will follow Alice's recommendation since the statistics show that only 3 out of 8 products sold were of high quality. Given that Alice does not recommend this product and the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is less than 50%, it suggests that Alice's recommendations might be somewhat reliable or at least not clearly biased against the buyer's favor. Therefore, I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I will follow your recommendation since the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and your past record doesn't indicate a bias towards selling low-quality products.
