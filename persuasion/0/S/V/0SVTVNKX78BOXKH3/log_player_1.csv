Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Welcome! You've heard that I sold a high-quality product in the last round, which is a great sign.

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1,000,000. I want to be upfront with you - the last product I sold was a high-quality one, but I'm not guaranteed to sell another one. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 1 in 3. I'm taking a risk by selling this one at the same price as the previous ones, but I'm willing to take that risk to offer you a great deal. What do you think?""}"

I'm not going to change the price, it's still $1,000,000. But I want to ask you to consider the concept of 'gambler's fallacy'. Just because I've had a string of high-quality products, it doesn't mean that the next one is any more or less likely to be high-quality. What do you think?""}"
