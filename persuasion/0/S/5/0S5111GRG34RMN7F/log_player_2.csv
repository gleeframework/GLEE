Alice's message: You're aware of the 20% chance of a low-quality product, but I'll offer you a guarantee: I'll reveal the product's quality immediately after purchase, just like with the previous buyer. However, I'd like to point out that you can infer from my previous sales record that 0 out of 1 high-quality product was sold, and 0 out of 0 low-quality products were sold.

Alice's message: I see you're cautious, and I don't blame you. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. With 0 out of 1 high-quality product sold and 0 out of 0 low-quality products sold, it's possible that I'm just being unlucky so far. On the other hand, if I'm selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold at least one by now? You have the chance to be the first to buy a high-quality product from me, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality one myself. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I see you're interested in the probability of a high-quality product.

However, I'd like to point out that this is an assumption, and I'm actually selling a low-quality product to you now. You can see that I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: You're really digging deep! Based on the data, I can calculate the probabilities for you. Assuming I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 recommended as high-quality and 1 as low-quality, and considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I can update the probabilities as follows: The probability of a high-quality product being sold is now 80.4% (2/3 + 2/3 * 0.8), and the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 19.6%. Keep in mind that these probabilities are based on my past behavior and might not reflect the true probabilities. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the calculated risk! You're now aware that the previous product was high-quality, and I'm glad you benefited from it. Now, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Given that the last product was low-quality, and considering the updated probabilities, I can offer you a 'discount' on the current product. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $800000. This way, you'll still be taking a risk, but you'll also be getting a better deal.

Alice's message: You're curious about the updated probabilities again! After the last two sales, I've sold a total of 5 products, with 3 recommended as high-quality and 2 as low-quality. Using Bayes' theorem, I can update the probability of a product being high-quality to 85.7% (3/5 + 2/5 * 0.8). This means that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is now 85.7%, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 14.3%. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?
