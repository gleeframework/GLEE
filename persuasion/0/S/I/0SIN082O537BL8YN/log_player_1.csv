It's not every day you come across something like this. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free 'quality guarantee'. If you're not satisfied with the product's quality, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced. The 'quality guarantee' doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.

It's a $200 product, and I'm offering it to you for $100 - a steal if I do say so myself!""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not convinced. You've already offered me two low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that's just the luck of the draw. I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product without knowing its quality.

The previous two products were indeed low-quality, but this one is different. I'm willing to offer you a'split-the-difference' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality, but if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for the full $100. This way, you'll only lose $50 if it's a dud, but you'll get to keep a $200 product if it's a winner. What do you think?""}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the split-the-difference deal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing $50 if the product is low-quality, but I could gain $100 if it's high-quality, which would make it a good deal for me.

This time, I'll give you a straightforward offer: this product is worth $200, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a no-brainer, don't you think?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm glad I made the right decision on the previous product, and I'm glad you're impressed with my strategy. However, I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice.

If you buy this one and it's low-quality, the $20 discount will still be applied to the next product. It's a small consolation, but it's something. What do you think?""}"

What do you think?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the heads up, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I already bought a low-quality product under the 'no-risk' deal, and I'm not going to pay $100 for another product that's likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.
