high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1 products sold. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold at least 0.8 high-quality products by now.

Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold at least 1.6 high-quality products by now. Since I've already sold 2 high-quality products, it's likely that I'm on a hot streak. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've also sold 2 products in a row, which is a bit unusual. I'm offering you this next product for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",

This suggests that the streak was likely just a coincidence. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm offering you this next product for $10000. Considering the unexpected low-quality product, I'm willing to offer a slight discount to compensate for the risk. I'll sell it to you for $8000.

Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold at least 3.2 high-quality products by now. I'm offering you this next product for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold at least 4 high-quality products by now. Since I've actually sold 5 high-quality products, it's likely that I've got a good streak going. However, I want to caution you that the probability of a product being high-quality is not 100%, and I've sold 5 products in a row. I'm offering you this next product for $10000.

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd expect to have sold at least 4.8 high-quality products by now. The fact that I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row suggests that I may be experiencing a genuine hot streak. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm starting to worry that I might be selling too many high-quality products in a row, which could indicate that I'm somehow gaming the system.

I'm offering you this next product for $10000. Given the recent low-quality product, I'm willing to offer a slight discount to compensate for the risk. I'll sell it to you for $9000.
