Alice's message: You've seen that the first product was high-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, you might expect to see a 50% chance of a high-quality product in each round. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique deal: I'll give you a 2-for-1 deal. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product for free. This way, you'll get two products for the price of one. The price is still $1000000.
