"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** Even with the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive.
    * Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
    * Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000
* **Price vs. Value:** The product is priced at $1,000,000, which is exactly the expected value. This means Bob is not losing money on average, even considering the risk of getting a low-quality product.

Therefore, it is recommended to advise Bob to buy the product in this round."

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Bob's decision to buy in the previous round doesn't change the fundamental information:

* **The price is still $1,000,000** 
* **There's still a 50% chance of the product being high-quality.**

The expected value calculation remains the same as in Round 1:

* Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

Since the product is high-quality and the price is equal to the expected value, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy."
