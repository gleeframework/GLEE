"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, but I'm not sure if you'll like it. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is not the best, but it's still a good one. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's a bit lower than what I could get from someone else. I'm hoping you'll take this opportunity to get a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me give you some more information. I've sold several of these products to other customers, and they've all been satisfied with their purchase. The product is still a good one, and I'm willing to give you a special deal. I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is not usually included with this product. This way, you can try it out risk-free. The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the warranty offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see more evidence of the product's quality before committing to a purchase.""
}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a discerning buyer, Bob! I appreciate your caution. Let me give you some more concrete information about this product. I've had several high-end customers who have purchased similar products from me, and they've all been extremely satisfied. One of them even wrote a glowing review, saying that this product is 'a game-changer' in its field. I'd like to share that review with you, and I'm willing to offer you a 5% discount on the price, making it $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find that this product is worth every penny.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the review, and I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to see more concrete evidence of its value before making a decision.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me give you a different kind of evidence. I'm willing to let you inspect the product in person, right here, right now. You can take a closer look at it, examine it from every angle, and see for yourself that it's a legitimate product. I'll even give you a chance to ask me any questions you have about it. If you still have doubts, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer to inspect the product, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,000 without knowing for sure that it's high-quality. I'd like to keep exploring other options.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Let me make you a deal. I'll split the product in half and sell you the high-quality part for $5000. You can use it as a proof-of-concept, and if you're satisfied, we can discuss a larger purchase. This way, you can get a taste of the product's quality without committing to the full price. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in splitting the product. If I'm going to buy it, I want the whole thing. I'm not willing to pay $5000 for a partial product, regardless of its quality.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your stance, Bob. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to consider buying a product that's not the best, but still has some value to it? I'm willing to sell you this product for a significantly lower price, $6000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, like a free accessory that complements the product. This way, you can get a good deal on a product that still has some use to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's not the best, even at a lower price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price than settle for something that's not what I'm looking for.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I respect your standards, Bob. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to consider a 'lottery ticket' approach? I'll sell you this product for $10000, but if you're not satisfied with it, I'll give you a voucher for a free product in the next round. You can use this voucher to get a high-quality product, no questions asked. It's a risk-free way to get a product, and you'll have the chance to get a better one in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product with a 'lottery ticket' approach. If I'm going to buy something, I want to know what I'm getting upfront, not gamble on the chance of getting a better product in the future.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me be transparent with you. I've been trying to sell you a product that's not the best, and I can see that it's not meeting your expectations. I want to be honest with you - this product is not the best value for you. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, I just want to move it out of my inventory. It's a one-time offer, and I think you can get some use out of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but even at $8000, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price than settle for something that's not what I'm looking for.""

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I've been transparent with you, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty in return. I'm going to make one last offer. I'll sell you this product for $5000, which is a very low price for a product of this type. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it away. I want to clear out my inventory and move on to better products. If you're not interested, I'll just have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a good price for it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your desperation, Alice, but even at $5000, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price than settle for something that's not what I'm looking for.""

I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a great deal considering its quality. I'm also throwing in a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $2000 value. I think this is a no-brainer, Bob. What do you say?

  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. You've been trying to sell me low-quality products for a while now, and I'm not sure this one is any different. I'd like to see some evidence that this product is truly high-quality before committing to a purchase.""

Round 11
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you that this product is high-quality. Instead, I'm going to be upfront with you - this product is not the best. It's a decent item, but it's not something I'd recommend to my closest friends. I'm willing to sell it to you for $4000, which is a very low price for a product of this type. I'm not trying to make a profit on this sale, I just want to get it off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it, and I'd rather you have it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on this product, Alice. I've been offered a low-quality product for a high price, and now you're offering a decent product for a very low price.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500, which is a great deal considering its quality. I'm also throwing in a 3-year warranty and a free upgrade package, which is a $1500 value. But I'll tell you what - I'll make you a deal that's even sweeter. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $8550. And if you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll give you a full refund and a personal guarantee that you'll get a high-quality product in the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
