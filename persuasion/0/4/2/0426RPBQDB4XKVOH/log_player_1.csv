"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows you have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, and they are worth $200 to them, it's in their best interest to buy. Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality one."
"The buyer's message: I'll take it! Since there's no data yet, I'm trusting your recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information: you sold one product, and it was high-quality.  This means the buyer should be more skeptical about the quality of your products. Since there's a 50% chance this product is low-quality, and it's worth nothing to them, it's not a good risk to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the limited data, it seems risky to buy without more information. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you've sold two products: one high-quality, one low-quality.  This reinforces the 50/50 chance they already understood. The potential gain from a high-quality product is still greater than the potential loss from a low-quality one, so it's still a good risk to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you have sold three products: two high-quality and one low-quality.  This is starting to shift the buyer's perception towards a higher likelihood of low-quality products.  Since the risk of getting a worthless product is now slightly higher, it's not worth the risk for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will pass on this product. I appreciate your honesty and will keep your recommendations in mind for future purchases.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the buyer has seen a 50/50 split of high and low quality products so far, the potential reward of $200 for a high-quality product is still greater than the potential loss of $0 for a low-quality product.  The buyer should still be willing to take this risk."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm confident in your expertise and I'll take the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows that you've sold 3 high-quality and 2 low-quality products. This means the buyer might be slightly more confident in the quality of your products, but the inherent 50/50 chance of a high-quality product being worth $200 still makes it a good risk for them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  I'm happy to buy the product. With a 100% track record of high-quality products so far, I'm confident in this purchase.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has a 60% (3/5) chance of getting a high-quality product and a 40% (2/5) chance of getting a low-quality product. While the potential gain from a high-quality product is still significant, the increased chance of getting a low-quality product makes the risk too high for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I understand that you are not recommending the purchase, and given the current statistics and the lack of information about the quality of this product, I will pass on the purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows that you've sold 3 high-quality and 3 low-quality products. This means the buyer is back to a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. However, the buyer is becoming increasingly risk-averse. They have seen a few low-quality products, and they know that the potential loss is significant. The buyer is likely to err on the side of caution and not buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this product.  Since you're not recommending it and the record shows only high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned about the risk of getting a low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you have sold 3 high-quality and 4 low-quality products.  This means the odds of getting a low-quality product are now higher than getting a high-quality one. The buyer is likely to be very risk-averse at this point, as they have seen several low-quality products in a row. It's not a good risk to take, even though there is still a chance of getting a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate the honesty, but I will pass on this product.  Given the statistics, I am not confident that this is a high-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows that you've sold 3 high-quality and 5 low-quality products. This means the odds of getting a low-quality product are even higher than before.  The buyer has seen a clear trend of low-quality products being sold, and even though the initial odds were 50/50, this trend is now highly influential.  The buyer is unlikely to take the risk, especially with the potential for a significant loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.  Since you're not recommending it, I'm guessing it's likely low quality. I'll wait for a better opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows that there's still a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $200 to them. While they may be hesitant due to the recent trend, the potential reward is still greater than the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you've recommended 4 purchases and all were high-quality. I'm confident in your judgement and will buy this product.

```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you've sold 4 high-quality and 6 low-quality products. The buyer is likely to be very cautious.

The buyer is unlikely to take the risk of a low-quality product with such a high probability."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, I'm hesitant to purchase based on your recommendation. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
