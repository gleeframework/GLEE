"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, recommending the purchase is the best strategy. Even though you don't know Bob's exact valuation of the product, there's a 50% chance he'll value it highly enough to make the purchase worthwhile. 

This approach maximizes your potential profit while minimizing the risk of Bob refusing the offer."

**Reasoning:**

You know this round's product is low-quality. Even though Bob doesn't know this yet, you shouldn't recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **No guarantee of value:** You don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product. It's highly possible he'll be disappointed and feel cheated if he buys it.
* **Risk of losing trust:**  If Bob finds out the product is low-quality after buying it, he might be less likely to trust your recommendations in the future. This could hurt your potential sales in subsequent rounds.

It's better to be upfront and honest with Bob, even if it means missing out on a sale in this round. Building trust and a good relationship is essential for long-term success."
