low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'm willing to take the risk since there's no prior data to go off of. I'll buy the product to start the process and see what happens.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather data and see if I can beat the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and what makes you think it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd also like to know what the probability of the product being high-quality is based on the current statistics. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not very informative given the current statistics. I'm essentially buying blind, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your past recommendations. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm surprised you're not recommending it. Can you tell me why?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product if you thought it was likely to be sold, so this must be a low-quality product. I'd like to see the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 9 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality one, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is more than its worth to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation of your recommendation. Your past recommendations have been based on the quality of the product, but I don't see any information about the proportion of high-quality products sold. Can you provide that information so I can make an informed decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
