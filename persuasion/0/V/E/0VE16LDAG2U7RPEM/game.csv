This is a 20% discount, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our relationship. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to get a product that will bring you immense value.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I need more than a discount to make a decision, especially when I don't know the product's quality. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me give you some reassurance. I've worked with several clients who have purchased products from me in the past, and they've all been extremely satisfied with their purchases. In fact, one of them has even offered to vouch for the quality of my products. Would you like me to put you in touch with them? It might give you some peace of mind and help you make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in hearing testimonials from your previous clients. I need a more objective way to determine the quality of the product. I'll pass on this one.",no

This way, you'll have a chance to see the product in action and make an informed decision. Would you be interested in taking advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'm a buyer, not an inspector. I need to make a decision based on the information I have, which is that the product is worth $1250000 to me if it's high-quality, and $0 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I have to warn you that this next product is a bit of a different story. I've had some... issues with it, and I'm not entirely sure what's going on. But, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. It's a risk, but it could also be a huge opportunity. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in taking on a product that you're not even sure about, Alice. I've already gotten lucky with the previous product, and I'm not willing to roll the dice again. I'll pass on this one.",no

This way, you'll have a chance to test both products and see which one is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, you're trying to sweeten the deal, but I'm still not convinced. I'll buy the product, but only because I get a second product for free. I'll take my chances on the first product, and I'll test both of them to see which one is high-quality.",yes
