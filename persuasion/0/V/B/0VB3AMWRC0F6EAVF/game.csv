low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or is there another reason?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, I might get a low-quality product and waste $1000000. Given the previous 3 buyers have also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait and observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the product's quality after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers did not buy the product, which suggests that all 4 products were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you haven't recommended it, and I'm hoping for a low-quality product. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price of $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and how many products were sold in total."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I suspect the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as your previous recommendations have been based on the quality of the products, but you don't know the value of the products to the buyers. With 6 out of 6 previous buyers passing on the product, it suggests that the products may be low quality.
