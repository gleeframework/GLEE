Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! To calculate the probability, I used the sales record of the previous products. Out of the 8 products sold, 5 were high-quality and 3 were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 5/8 or 62.5%.

Alice's message: I understand your request for more information. Unfortunately, I don't have any data on the distribution of sales across different time periods, as my sales are relatively new and I don't have a large enough dataset to analyze. However, I can tell you that the quality of products has been relatively consistent across all sales, with a slight bias towards high-quality products in the earlier sales. However, this bias may be due to chance rather than any underlying pattern. With that said, I want to be upfront with you that this new product is not one of the high-quality ones.
