Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. Given the probability of 80% of high-quality products, I would expect to have sold 0.8 products at this point if all products were high-quality. Since I've sold 1 product, it's likely that the next product is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've also sold 1 out of 2 products, which is higher than the expected 0.8. This could be due to the law of small numbers. The price remains $100.

I'll just reiterate that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, which is 100% of the products I've sold. This is indeed higher than the expected 80%, but it's still just a small sample size. I'm not making any claims about the likelihood of this product being high-quality. The price remains $100.

Alice's message: I can provide some context on the probability update. Given the observed proportion of high-quality products sold (5/8), the Bayesian update suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is now around 83.3% (using a simple Bayesian update formula). However, I want to caution that this is a rough estimate and the true probability is still uncertain. Additionally, the recent streak of low-quality products suggests that the true probability might be closer to 80%. The price remains $100.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in my thought process! As the seller, I've been observing the sales data and updating my understanding of the probability of a product being high-quality. Initially, the observed proportion of high-quality products was higher than expected, but it has since regressed towards the expected 80%. This is a classic example of the law of large numbers, where the observed proportion converges to the true probability as the sample size increases.
