"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and this product is confirmed to be high-quality, the expected value of the purchase is:

* 0.8 * $200 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $160

This is greater than the price of $100. Therefore, Bob should buy the product."

```
