However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness. As you can see from our previous rounds, I've had two low-quality products in a row. Given the odds, it's likely that the next product I offer will be high-quality. And if you're willing to take the chance, I'm offering you this product at the same price of $1000000.
