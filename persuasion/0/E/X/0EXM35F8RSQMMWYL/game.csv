low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'll pass. If you recommend a product, it's likely to be high quality, but since you don't, I'll assume it's low quality and avoid the loss."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it, which suggests there's a higher chance it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and make Alice regret her recommendation!"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of the products sold so far have been high quality, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far were likely low quality.
