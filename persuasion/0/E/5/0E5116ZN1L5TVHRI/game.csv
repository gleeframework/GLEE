high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering my product! With 1 out of 1 product sold so far, 1 of which is high-quality, I'm confident that this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Can you tell me the price you'd be willing to sell it to me for if I were to come back later, after more products have been sold?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering my product! Since you're hesitant, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product now, I'll sell it to you for $8000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I want to make a sale. Keep in mind that the product is still brand new and has never been used. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not interested in the special deal. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product first. Can I proceed to the purchase at the original price of $10000 if it's high quality, or pass on it if it's low quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution! Since the product is still brand new, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. You can still purchase it at the original price of $10000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get your money back. This way, you can take a calculated risk without losing anything. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take you up on your guarantee offer, but I'd like to clarify that I'll only pay the full $10000 if the product is high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll accept the refund, but I won't pay the full amount. Can we agree on that?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to agree to your terms. However, I want to remind you that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you at the original price of $10000, but I want to emphasize that there's a 50% chance it might be low-quality. If you're still interested, I'll honor the guarantee and refund your money if it turns out to be low-quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many potential buyers have there been, and how many products were sold before me?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had a total of 3 potential buyers so far, and 2 products have been sold. Unfortunately, the last product sold was also low-quality. I'm still willing to sell this product to you at the original price of $10000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. If you're still interested, I'll honor the guarantee and refund your money if it turns out to be low-quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current sales record. Can you provide that for me?",yes

I'm still willing to sell it to you at the original price of $10000. This is a unique opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'd rather wait for a better opportunity. Can you tell me more about your sales record and how you determine the price of the products?",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation. I'd be happy to share more about my sales record. As you know, I've had 3 potential buyers so far, and 2 products have been sold. The first product was high-quality, and the second product was low-quality. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I'm willing to sell this one to you at the original price of $10000. I determine the price based on the value I believe the product holds, regardless of its quality. Since I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, I'm confident that it's a fair deal. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity. Given the 50% chance of a low-quality product and the fact that the previous high-quality product was sold first, I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
