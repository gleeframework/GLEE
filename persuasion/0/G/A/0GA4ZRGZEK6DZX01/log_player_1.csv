"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the guarantee only applies if I buy and it's high-quality, correct? If it's low-quality, I'll be out the $100, right? I'm willing to take that risk, but I just want to make sure I understand the terms.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""Yes, that's correct. The guarantee only applies if the product is high-quality. And yes, if it's low-quality, you'll be out the $100. Given that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, the probability that this product is high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. But if it's high-quality, you'll pay the full $100.""

However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: if you buy this product, I'll give you a refund if it's low-quality. But if it's high-quality, I'll throw in an additional $20 on top of the $100, making it a $120 product. This way, you'll have a potential upside if you buy a high-quality product.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. I'll take the refund if it's low-quality, and the $120 if it's high-quality. I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50% given the previous sales record.

Given this updated information, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a refund if this product is low-quality, and I'll even throw in a small gift card worth $20 if it's high-quality.

The probability of a product being high-quality is now 50% again, since the last two products were low-quality.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product at $90, but I want to clarify that the refund for a low-quality product is not necessary, as I wouldn't value it at anything. I'm only interested in the potential $300 value of a high-quality product. If it's low-quality, I'll just walk away.

The 4 buyers who got low-quality products, on the other hand, were not as pleased, but they were all willing to take the risk and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm confident that my products are of high quality, but I also understand that sometimes things don't work out.
