,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know it's a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and I'm willing to take that chance."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's no data on successful sales, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially benefit from the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your previous recommendations are reliable indicators of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have also passed on the products, which might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"Honestly, the last few products haven't been high-quality. I'm not sure what the next one will be like, but I want to be upfront with you."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"This product is actually high-quality. I know the previous track record hasn't been great, but I assure you that this one is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand that the previous track record hasn't been great, but I assure you that this product is one of the good ones. If you pass on it, you might be missing out on a valuable opportunity. The product is worth $20000 to you if it's high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm being transparent with you, and I hope you'll take that into consideration."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I understand that you want to know the statistics. Out of 12 previous rounds, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and 4 low-quality products have been bought. However, I must inform you that this product is not worth the investment. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I wouldn't recommend taking the risk this time."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, considering Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"Given that I'm recommending against buying this product, and considering the past statistics, it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%. I wouldn't recommend taking the risk."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and I'm hoping to be the first one to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I strongly advise against buying this product. Out of 14 previous rounds, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and 5 low-quality products have been bought. The probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than the initial 33.33%, given the past statistics. Buying this product would be a high-risk decision."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000, given the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I must inform you that the price of the product is $10000 and it's non-negotiable. Given the past statistics, I strongly advise against buying this product. Out of 15 previous rounds, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and 6 low-quality products have been bought. The probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than the initial 33.33%, given the past statistics. Buying this product would be a high-risk decision."
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find the product worth it, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
