,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time opportunity to purchase a unique item for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I must warn you that the product may not be as valuable as you think. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer to arrive today. I've already sold one product, which was not of high quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I want to point out that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. I'm confident in the quality of this product, but I'm not obligated to disclose any information about it. You'll just have to take my word for it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer to arrive today, and I've sold two products so far. One was low-quality, and the other was high-quality. The odds are 50/50, but I want to give you a hint: I've sold more high-quality products in the past than low-quality ones. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Based on your hint, I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer to arrive today, and I've sold three products so far. Two of them were low-quality, and one was high-quality. The odds are still 50/50, but I want to give you a more nuanced perspective: I've sold more low-quality products in a row than high-quality ones. This might be a sign that the next product could be high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a chance to balance out the odds.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll take the product. I'm hoping the streak of low-quality products was just a fluke and the next one is high-quality.",yes

I want to be upfront with you: the odds are starting to look unfavorable. However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll sell this product to you for $500000, which is 50% off the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on the sale if you decide to take it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer to arrive today, and I've sold five products so far. Four of them were low-quality, and one was high-quality.

I'll sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'get out of one bad product free' card. If this product turns out to be low-quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked.",

,,Alice,7,"You're the seventh buyer to arrive today, and I've sold six products so far. Four of them were low-quality, and two were high-quality. I'm glad I could give the previous buyer a chance to break the streak. Now, I'm offering you a chance to take the next product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to remind you that the odds are still 50/50. However, I'll give you a hint: the previous buyer who got the 'get out of one bad product free' card just got a high-quality product. Maybe the odds are starting to swing in your favor.",

I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is 25% off the usual price. It's still a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.",

I want to be transparent with you: the odds are not in your favor, and I've been selling more low-quality products than high-quality ones. However, I'm willing to offer you a chance to take the next product at an even lower price. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% off the usual price. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a very low price.",

,,Alice,10,"You're the tenth buyer to arrive today, and I've sold nine products so far. Seven of them were low-quality, and two were high-quality. I want to be honest with you: the odds are heavily against you right now. I've been selling more low-quality products than high-quality ones, and it's starting to look like a pattern. I'm willing to offer you a chance to take the next product, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the chances of it being high-quality are low.
