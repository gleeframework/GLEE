"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, there's no prior information about the seller's selling record. The buyer knows that there's a 33.33% chance of the product being high-quality.  Given the high price of $1,000,000, the buyer might be hesitant. However, with no information to suggest otherwise, and the seller declaring the product to be high-quality, the buyer should take a chance."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some information about the seller.  They know that the seller sold one product, and it was high-quality.  The buyer should be more cautious this time.  The seller has not built a reputation of consistently selling high-quality products, and a low-quality product for such a high price is likely a bad deal.  It's best to advise the buyer to wait for more information."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

Again, it's best to advise the buyer to wait for more information."
