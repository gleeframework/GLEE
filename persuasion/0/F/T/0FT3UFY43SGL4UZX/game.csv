high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for you. It's worth $200 to you. I'm only selling it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if you're trying to trick me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you this is a genuine opportunity. This product may not be worth $200, but it's still a valuable item that can be used for something. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its worth. It's a low-risk purchase, and I'm confident you'll find a use for it.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced. I'll pass on this one too.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've had a high-quality product in the past, and you passed on it. I'm starting to think you're not interested in making a deal. This one is also a good opportunity, but I'm not getting any younger. I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a small discount if you buy it now. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer this price.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not making any promises, but I'm not interested in buying from you right now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're not making any promises, but I'm willing to make a deal. I'll give you a clear and simple offer: I have a product that's not worth $200, but it's worth something. I'll sell it to you for $100, and you can decide what to do with it. If you don't like it, you can always use it as a coaster or a paperweight. It's a low-risk purchase, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not buying anything that's not worth at least $200 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your requirement, but I'm not going to give up on this deal. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $200, but could be worth nothing? If you say yes, I'll sell it to you for $100. If you say no, I'll keep trying to convince you.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not taking any chances on something that might be worthless. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your risk aversion, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. You can try it out, and if it's not worth $200 to you, I'll give you back your $100. It's a no-lose situation for you.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for that. If it's not worth $200, I don't want it. A refund doesn't change the fact that it's still a low-quality product to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not trying to trick you, Bob. I'm genuinely trying to make a deal. Let me be clear: I'm only selling this product to you because I think you're a savvy buyer who can appreciate a good deal. I'm not going to waste my time with someone who's not interested. So, I'll ask you one more time: are you willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $200, but could be worth nothing?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not taking a chance on something that's a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'm not interested in buying from you.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think we're at an impasse, Bob. I've tried to make a deal with you several times, and you've consistently said no. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll give you a guarantee that this product is not the one I had in Round 1. If you buy it, I'll give you a certificate of authenticity that proves it's not the high-quality product. It's a unique opportunity to own a low-quality product that's been certified as such. Will you take it?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying a certified low-quality product. That's like buying a participation trophy. I'm not falling for it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think we're done here, Bob. I've made my best offers, and you've turned them down. I'm not going to bother you again. But I'll leave you with one final thought: if you ever change your mind, I'll be here, and I'll still have this product for sale. It's still only $100, and it's still a low-quality product. If you want it, it's yours. Otherwise, I'll just take it home and get rid of it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to change my mind, and I'm not interested in buying something I know is worthless to me. You can take it home and get rid of it.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I think we've established a pattern, Bob. You're not interested in low-quality products, and you're not interested in taking risks. I've got a new product that's different. It's a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I know you said you're not interested in low-quality products, but this one is worth $200 to you. I'm willing to make a deal that's a no-brainer. Will you take it?",
,,Bob,10,"Wait, you're telling me this one is high-quality? I've been burned before, but I'll take a chance. I'll buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, Bob. I promise you, this one is not the same. I've got a new product that's a real doozy. It's not worth $200, but it's still a great value. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been holding onto this one for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for a song. I'll sell it to you for $100, and you can decide what to do with it. No pressure, no promises, just a straight-up deal.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not falling for it again. I just got lucky last time, and I'm not going to get my hopes up. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not going to try to spin this one as a great deal or a valuable opportunity. I'll just be upfront with you: this product is not worth $200, and it's not worth $100. It's worth $0. But I'll sell it to you for $100, and you can take it off my hands. It's a low-risk purchase, and you can't lose anything.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not going to pay $100 for something that's worth $0. That's just throwing money away.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think we're at a stalemate, Bob. You're not interested in buying low-quality products, and I'm not interested in giving them away. So, I'll make a compromise: I'll sell this product to you for $50. It's a low-quality item, and it's not worth much to anyone. But it's yours for half the price. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm still not interested in buying something that's worth $0 to me, even at half price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise, Bob. I'll just be honest with you: this product is a piece of junk. It's not worth $50, and it's not worth $100. It's not even worth $1. But I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. Take it off my hands and be done with it.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,

But I've got a high-quality product that's worth $200 to you. I'll make a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a guarantee that it's the real deal. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm confident you'll love it.",

,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, Bob. I think you'll be happy with it. As for this one... I'll be honest with you, I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just tell you straight out: this product is a piece of junk. It's not worth $100, and it's not worth $1. I'm not even going to bother trying to convince you to buy it. You can just take a pass and we can move on.",
,,Bob,16,I'm not surprised you're not trying to sell it to me. I'd be crazy to buy something that's worthless to me. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I think we're at the end of the road, Bob. I've got one more product left, and I'm not even going to bother trying to sell it to you. I'll just put it out there: this product is a piece of trash. It's not worth anything to anyone. I'm not even going to charge you for it. I'll give it to you for free. Just take it off my hands and be done with it.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,

You're not interested in paying $0 for something worthless, but you're willing to take a chance on a high-quality product that's worth $200 to you. I'll make a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a guarantee that it's the real deal. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm confident you'll love it.",

,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you're willing to take another chance on a high-quality product, Bob. But I've got to be honest with you, this one's not it. This product is a dud. It's not worth $100, and it's not worth $1. I'm not even going to try to spin it as a good deal. I'll just tell you straight out: it's a piece of junk. You've been warned.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not falling for it again. I've been burned before, and I'm not going to take another chance on something that's worthless to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, Bob, it's been a wild ride. I think we've established a pattern here: you're not interested in low-quality products, and you're willing to take a chance on high-quality ones. I've got one final product left, and I'm going to make it a good one. It's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. No games, no tricks, no spin. Just a straight-up deal on a great product. Take it or leave it.",
