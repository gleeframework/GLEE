,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a product that's worth at least $10000! It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is a rare gem. I've had several other buyers who were willing to pay top dollar for it, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. Trust me, you won't regret it. It's a limited edition product, and I'm only offering it to you at this price because I believe you'll appreciate its true value.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the potential loss if it's low-quality is $10000, which is not worth the risk.",no
