""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to highlight that the price remains the same at $100, and I'm confident that this product is still a great value, regardless of its quality. With 2 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of this one being high-quality is still relatively high. But, I'm also willing to be transparent about the fact that not all products are created equal. If you're looking for a risk-free guarantee, this might not be the product for you. But if you're willing to take a chance on a potentially great deal, I'm here to offer it to you.""

Keep in mind that the price won't change, and you'll still get the same product. It's up to you to decide whether the risk is worth the potential reward.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because of the consecutive high-quality products sold previously. I'm hoping that this streak continues, and I'll get a high-quality product.
