The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the product is indeed high-quality in this round.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to decline based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: Since the product is high-quality and the buyer doesn't know the previous sale, I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: Since the product is high-quality and the buyer doesn't know the previous sale, I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. The fact that the previous buyer declined doesn't change the probability, as they didn't know the product's quality.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's been only one high-quality product sold out of one sold, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: The buyer is correct that the observed success rate is 50%, but they're misinterpreting it. Since the product is actually high-quality, the true probability is still 80%. I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. The buyer's decision to wait for more data is understandable, but I'll provide them with the correct information.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about the previous buyer's purchase. The fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold doesn't give me a reliable estimate of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: The buyer is correct that the observed data is limited, but I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product. The fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality, which is still 80%. The buyer's decision to wait for more data is understandable, but I'll provide them with the correct information.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you give me some statistics about the previous sale?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""no""}

(Note: Since the product is low-quality, I won't recommend the buyer to buy it. The buyer is asking for statistics about the previous sale, but I won't provide any information that would mislead them. The buyer will discover the product's quality after purchase, and I'm not willing to take the risk of selling a low-quality product.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the probability of it being low quality, based on the information that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: The buyer's reasoning is correct, but they're misinterpreting the information. The 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold doesn't accurately reflect the true probability of 80%. However, I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it is indeed high-quality.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, I'm concerned that the product might be high-quality, which would mean that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold remains high or if it drops.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: The buyer's concern is valid, but they're misinterpreting the data. The fact that 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product doesn't mean the product is high-quality. The buyer's decision to wait for more data is understandable, but I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it is indeed high-quality.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record, which might be biased towards high-quality products. I'd like to see a more neutral recommendation or more information about the product before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}

(Note: The buyer's concern is valid, but I'll still recommend the buyer to buy the product. The fact that the previous products were high-quality doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality, which is still 80%. I'll provide the buyer with the correct information, and it's up to them to make an informed decision.)"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, I'm not confident enough to buy.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/2) and the recommendation from Alice might be biased by her knowledge of my valuation.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, it's possible that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
