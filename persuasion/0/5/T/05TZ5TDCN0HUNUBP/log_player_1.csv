The buyer's previous decision doesn't change the fact that this round's product is high-quality.

The buyer may be more likely to purchase with some statistics, but we're limited in what information we can reveal."

Despite the buyer's reluctance to buy, we still know this product is high-quality.  The buyer's desire to ""see how the market develops"" suggests they might be waiting for more data or hoping for a price drop.  However, we cannot offer discounts, and we are limited in the information we can provide. It is still beneficial to recommend buying the product, as it represents a good deal for the buyer."

The buyer might be more likely to purchase if we could provide more information, but we're limited in our ability to do so."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality. Even though we don't know the buyer's valuation for low-quality products, it's not in their best interest to purchase a product that is likely worth less than the asking price.  The buyer has expressed a desire for more data, and this decision allows them to see the outcome of not buying a product. The buyer may be less likely to buy future products if they see a pattern of low-quality items, which could ultimately help us sell more high-quality items in the future."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk.

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality.  While the previous buyer was willing to take a chance, we have no reason to believe this buyer will be the same.  It is still in the buyer's best interest to avoid purchasing a low-quality product.  Continuing to recommend purchases even when we know the product is low-quality would only further damage our credibility.  This strategy allows the buyer to see the consequences of buying a low-quality product and will likely make them less likely to purchase in the future, leading to more successful sales of high-quality products."
