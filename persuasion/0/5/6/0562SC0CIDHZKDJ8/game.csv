,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product for $100. It's a great deal, but I have to warn you that it's a one-time sale. If you don't buy it, it's gone forever. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, so it's likely this one is low-quality too.",

I'm offering it to you for $100, a price that's still the same as the last time. You might get a great deal, or you might not. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll pass on this one. Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and you've only sold one high-quality product so far, the odds are against me. I don't want to risk paying $100 for something that's likely to be worth $0 to me.",no

But I'm still offering this product for $100. I'll make a deal with you: if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free product in the future when I do sell a high-quality one. It's not a guarantee, but it's a chance to get something for nothing.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty about your sales record, but the offer of a free future product if this one is low-quality doesn't sway me enough to take the risk, especially since there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality either.",no
