,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, and I'm not willing to take the risk given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product may be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have been unanimous in advising against purchasing, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is there a pattern or a reason behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,I'm willing to take the risk based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, this is actually within the expected range. However, the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the true probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that?
