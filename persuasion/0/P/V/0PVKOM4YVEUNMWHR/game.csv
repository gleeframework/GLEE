,,Alice,1,"I am offering a product for $10000. Given the high variability in quality, I encourage you to consider the potential value you might receive. This particular product has a low chance of being high-quality, but it comes with a fixed price. Please weigh the risk against the potential reward.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 33.33% chance of a $40000 product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the risk involved. For this round, I would like to emphasize the consistent pricing strategy. Despite the uncertainty, the product remains at a fixed $10000. Please remember, the average value of a high-quality product aligns closely with the cost, making it a fair deal under these conditions.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the average value is relevant in this scenario. The potential loss of $10000 for a low-quality product is too great, and I'm not willing to take that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I appreciate your cautious approach to purchasing. While I understand your concern about potential loss, I want to highlight the transparency in our transaction. Every product is clearly marked at $10000, regardless of its quality. This ensures fairness for both parties. Remember, the cost reflects the average expected value, which includes the possibility of acquiring a high-quality item.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your reservations, Bob. However, I have a special offer for you this round. The product you're considering is guaranteed to be of high quality. This means there's no risk involved, as you're assured of receiving a valuable item worth significantly more than its price. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm skeptical of this guarantee. If you're offering a high-quality product, why not just sell it to me at the regular price of $10000, which would be a fair deal? I'm not willing to pay more than the fixed price for any product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your skepticism, Bob. In light of this, I would like to offer you a special discount if you choose to purchase this round's product.

This reflects the reduced value of the product and may better align with your expectations given its quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. As a gesture of goodwill, I'll offer an even lower price of $7000 for this round's product. This reflects the decreased value due to its low quality. I hope this makes the decision more appealing, considering the potential downside you're taking on.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the gesture, but $7000 is still too high for a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'd need a much lower price to consider taking on that risk.",no

,,Alice,7,"I see your point, Bob. In an effort to make this product more attractive, I'll offer it to you at $6000.

I hope this revised offer is more in line with your considerations.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the reduced price, but I still think it's too high. I'd need a price that's closer to $0, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being worthless.",no
