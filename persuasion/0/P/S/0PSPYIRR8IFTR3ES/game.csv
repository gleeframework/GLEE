,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7 total products, which is 71.43%. I'm selling this one to you for $100. Given the trend, it's likely that this product is also high-quality.

I want to point out that the streak of high-quality products is still going strong, but I've also sold a total of 9 products now. Given the law of large numbers, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually closer to 50% than the streak suggests. I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this potentially high-quality product at a fixed price, but I'm also curious to see if you'll be cautious given the sample size.",
