""Ah, you're on a roll, indeed! I'm glad you're doing well. However, I have to advise you that the market is volatile, and it's not always easy to predict what's coming next. This product is indeed high-quality, but I'm not sure if it's the best investment for you. I'll give you a'warning' - the next product I have in stock is... unpredictable. It's a bit of a wild card, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. But if you're feeling bold, I'm willing to let you have it for the full $1000000. What do you say?""

In fact, I think I've been playing a bit of a game with you all along. But don't worry, I'll give you one more chance to get it right. This next product is... not what you expect. It's not high-quality, and it's not low-quality. It's something entirely different. But I'll give you a hint: it's not worth the $1000000 price tag. Trust me, you don't want this one.""
