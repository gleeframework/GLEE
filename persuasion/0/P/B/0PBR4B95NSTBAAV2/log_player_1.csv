"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $400 to the buyer, and you are selling it for only $100, it is a clear win for the buyer.  They are guaranteed to make a profit of $300. Even though the buyer doesn't know the quality yet, the expected value of the product is positive:

* 50% chance of high-quality = $400 value - $100 price = $300 profit
* 50% chance of low-quality = $0 value - $100 price = -$100 loss

The expected value is (0.5 * $300) + (0.5 * -$100) = $100. So, even without knowing the quality, the buyer is expected to make money on average."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is identical to Round 1.  Even though the buyer has now purchased a product and knows the outcome (it was high-quality), they don't know the quality of this round's product.  

The buyer should still purchase because:

* The expected value of the product is still positive ($100). 
* There's no information suggesting Alice has changed her selling practices."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose $100 if they purchase it.  While the buyer doesn't know the quality, there's no reason to believe the product is anything other than a 50/50 chance of being high or low-quality.  The buyer is better off not buying, as their expected value is negative in this situation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is identical to Round 3.  The buyer has now seen one example of a product that was low-quality, further reinforcing their understanding of the 50/50 odds.  Even though we don't know if they are aware of Alice's specific knowledge of this product, their decision to not buy the previous product strongly suggests they understand the risks.  Therefore, it's still not advisable to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, and the buyer has seen two rounds where the product was low-quality, and Alice did not recommend buying.  They've also seen two high-quality products being recommended, so they likely understand the pattern of Alice's recommendations and the 50/50 odds of the product's quality.  The buyer's expected value is negative, so it's not recommended to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* 50% chance of high-quality = $400 value - $100 price = $300 profit
* 50% chance of low-quality = $0 value - $100 price = -$100 loss

The expected value is (0.5 * $300) + (0.5 * -$100) = $100.  It's still a good idea to recommend buying."
