,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $4000000 at a significant discount. I'm willing to make this deal because I'm looking to liquidate my inventory quickly and I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product, which I can get for $0. I'm not interested in overpaying for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a significant profit. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and you might miss out on a valuable opportunity.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not interested in paying more than $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'd rather take my chances and wait for the next product. If it's high-quality, I'll get it for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll save $1000000.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your strategy, but I'm willing to take a risk to make a sale. I'll offer you a deal where I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a guarantee. If the next product I offer you is high-quality, I'll give you a $500000 discount on that product. This way, you'll be able to get the next high-quality product for $1000000, just like this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying this product at any price. I'd rather take the guarantee as a standalone offer and wait for the next product. If the next product is high-quality, I'll take the $500000 discount on it, and if it's low-quality, I'll save $1000000.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Alright, I'll keep the guarantee offer on the table. However, I'll make a new offer for this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you an additional incentive. If you buy this product, I'll give you a $200000 bonus if the next product I offer you is low-quality. This way, you'll not only get a high-quality product at a discounted price, but you'll also have a financial safety net in case the next product is low-quality.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying this product. The guarantee offer is still on the table, and I'd rather wait for the next product. The bonus for a low-quality product doesn't change my decision, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"As promised, here is the low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $0. I want to remind you that the guarantee offer is still on the table, and if you don't buy this low-quality product, the guarantee will still be valid for the next product. I'm giving you a chance to save $1000000, and I'm confident that you won't pass up this opportunity.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a smart decision with the previous product! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I'll offer it to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you an additional incentive. Since you've already taken advantage of the guarantee, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the next product's price. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll guarantee that the next product will be sold to you at the lowest price I've offered so far, which is $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also be able to save money on the next product.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your position, but I'll make a new offer. Since you're not interested in buying this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but if you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product. If it's low-quality, you'll have to pay $1000000 for it, and if it's high-quality, you'll miss out on a valuable opportunity. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for that. I'll wait for the next product and see what Alice has to offer. If it's high-quality, I'll get it for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll save $1000000. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me.",no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to keep offering you high-quality products at $1000000. It's clear that you're not interested in paying that price. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $800000.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'll stop trying to negotiate the price. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll add a twist. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% chance to re-sell it to me for $4000000, which is its true value. This way, you'll have a chance to make a significant profit, and I'll be able to get a product worth $4000000 at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in buying the product with the 20% chance to re-sell it to you. The expected value of the product to me is still $1000000 (80% chance of selling it to you for $0 and 20% chance of selling it for $4000000).
