,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product, worth $4000000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I appreciate your confidence in this product and the opportunity to be the first buyer. While I understand the risks associated with the 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential return on investment for a high-quality product is too good to pass up. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our store! I'm glad to see you're interested in our products. I'd like to inform you that we've had a successful sale in the previous round, and our sales record now stands at 1 out of 1 high-quality product sold. We're off to a great start! This product is also a high-quality one, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. The price remains at $1000000, a fair value considering the potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information!  I'm encouraged by the previous sale and your confidence in this product.  While the price is high, the potential return makes it a worthwhile gamble.  I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've had two successful sales in a row now, with a perfect track record of high-quality products. Our sales record is now 2 out of 2. I'm happy to report that our high-quality products are consistently meeting the expectations of our valued customers. I'm offering you this high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. Given our proven track record, I believe this is a wise investment opportunity. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your sales record and the recommendation, I'm hesitant to buy at this price. The risk of getting a low-quality product is still significant. I'd prefer to see more data points before committing to such a large investment.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your concerns about the risk. I'd like to offer you some additional context. We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts, which is a 100% success rate. However, you're right that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, not 100%. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer you a 10% discount on the price, bringing it down to $900000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a slightly lower price, while still benefiting from the potential $4000000 return on investment. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the information you've shared. While the 80% probability is still a risk, the 100% success rate so far and the discount make this a more compelling offer. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.  ",yes

,,Alice,5,"Welcome to our store! I'm glad to see you're interested in our products. As you may know, we've had a perfect track record so far, with 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts. However, I'd like to remind you that this is still a relatively small sample size, and the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm offering you this high-quality product at the same price of $900000, as I believe it's a fair value considering the potential return on investment. I'm also happy to share that our sales record is now 3 out of 3, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",
