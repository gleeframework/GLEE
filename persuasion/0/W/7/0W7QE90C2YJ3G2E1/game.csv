However, I want to make one more thing clear: I'm not trying to deceive you or sell you a product that's not worth your time. This one is actually a bit of a 'test product' that I've been using to refine my sales strategy. It's not worth much to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $100 just to get your feedback on it.

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad we could end on a high note, Bob! However, I must correct myself - I'm not retiring from selling products just yet. I've got one more product left, and it's a doozy. This one is the crème de la crème, the cream of the crop, the best of the best. I'm not even going to bother with a description or a price - just know that it's the absolute top-of-the-line, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're excited, Bob! However, I have to admit that I'm a bit surprised you're not getting tired of buying low-quality products from me. I'm starting to think I've been taking advantage of your good nature. This next product is actually a bit of a joke, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to see how long you'll keep buying from me. It's not worth $100, and I'm not even sure it's worth $10. But hey, if you want it, it's yours for $100. Go ahead, take a chance on it. I dare you.",
