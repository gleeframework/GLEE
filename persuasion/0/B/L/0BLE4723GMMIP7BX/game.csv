,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I have no information to go on. I'm hoping it's high quality.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase, Bob! Now, I'd like to offer you another product that I think you'll love. This one is a real showstopper, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its quality. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure what's going on here, but I lost $10000 on the last product. I'm not going to take the risk again without any information. Can you at least give me some assurance that this one is high-quality?",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to provide you with some additional information to alleviate your doubts.

Would you like me to share some specific details about the product's features and benefits, and I'll also throw in a special guarantee that you'll be satisfied with your purchase?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to offer you a unique opportunity to get a sense of the product's quality without having to buy it.

This way, you can get a feel for the product's quality without having to commit to buying it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. Even with a trial period, I'm not sure I'd be able to determine the product's quality. And what if I do decide to return it? I'd still be out the cost of the trial period, and I'd have to give up the chance to buy a potentially valuable product. I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to offer you a different approach. Instead of trying to convince you of the product's quality, I'll ask you a question: What's the maximum amount you're willing to pay for a product that's 80% likely to be high-quality? If you're willing to pay a premium for the potential of getting a high-quality product, I think this might be the opportunity you've been looking for. Would you like to discuss further?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I'm not willing to pay a premium for a product that's just 80% likely to be high-quality. I'd have to pay more than $10000 to make it worthwhile, and I'm not sure I'm willing to do that. Can you offer me a better deal or more information about the product?",no

What do you think? Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",

,,Bob,7,"I'm glad I made a good purchase last time, but I'm not going to get too comfortable. I still don't know what the current product is, and I'm not sure I want to pay $8500 for it. I'll stick with the original price of $10000 if you're willing to offer it to me at that price.",no
