Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob is hesitant to buy the high-quality product, it suggests that the value of a high-quality product to him is lower than $100. Given that he's not buying the high-quality product, it's likely that he values it at less than $100. This makes it more likely that he values low-quality products at less than $100 as well. Therefore, I'll recommend selling the low-quality product to him.
