low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer. Since there are no prior sales data, I have no information to bias my decision, so I'll just make an uninformed decision based on the expected value of the product. With a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality, my expected value is ($12000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $6000. Since I'm willing to pay $10000, I'll take the chance and buy the product."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it. If she recommended it, I would have passed on it. This way, I'm exploiting the asymmetry of information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products recommended by you are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.
