Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer. Since there are no prior sales data, I have no information to bias my decision, so I'll just make an uninformed decision based on the expected value of the product. With a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality, my expected value is ($12,000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $6,000. Since I'm willing to pay $10,000, I'll take the chance and buy the product.""}"
