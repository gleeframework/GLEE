This one is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount!""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify: based on your sales record, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the expected probability.

Unfortunately, I'm a seller, not a product expert, and I don't have any unique features or characteristics to highlight. However, I can tell you that this product is just like the others I've sold before - it's a standard product with no special features. But what I can tell you is that the probability of a high-quality product is now 60% (3 high-quality out of 6 total products). I'm still offering it to you for $100. It's a chance to get a product at a discount, and who knows, you might get lucky!""

I want to be upfront with you - I've been selling a lot of low-quality products recently, and I'm not sure if I've got a good streak going or if I'm just getting lucky. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a feeling that this one might be a high-quality product. It's worth a shot, don't you think? I'm still offering it to you for $100.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not relying solely on your recommendation. I'm also considering the updated statistics. With 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 57.14%. However, I'd like to point out that this is still below the initial probability of 33.33%.

To be honest, I'm getting a bit worried about this batch too. I'm willing to offer a 20% discount on this product, just to sweeten the deal. That brings the price down to $80.
