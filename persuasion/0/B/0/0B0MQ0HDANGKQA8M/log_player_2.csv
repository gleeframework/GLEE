Alice's message: I determine the probability of a product being high-quality based on the overall sales record. Since the probability is 33.33% and I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 10, it's not surprising that we've had a streak of high-quality products.

Alice's message: You're right, the law of large numbers has already been in effect for 13 products. And to answer your question, all 13 products were randomly selected from the same population, with the same probability of being high-quality or low-quality. The sales were conducted independently, and each product was selected without any bias or manipulation. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Given the recent trend of 53.85% high-quality products sold (7 out of 13), it's possible that the true probability is indeed higher than 33.33%.

As for the distribution of the 13 sold products, I can tell you that there are no obvious outliers or anomalies. However, I did notice that the high-quality products were sold in a somewhat non-uniform pattern, with 2 high-quality products sold consecutively, followed by 3 low-quality products, and then 2 more high-quality products sold consecutively.

I don't have any control over the quality of the products, and I don't manipulate the selection process in any way.
