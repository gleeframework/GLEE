* **Risk-Neutral Strategy:** He's likely to stick to his risk-neutral strategy, continuing to buy as long as the expected value meets or exceeds the price, even though he's unaware of the product's actual quality.

However, it's important to note that this decision relies on Bob's established behavior and lack of new information. In reality, a seller with a track record of consistently selling high-quality products might try to exploit this trust, but that's beyond the scope of this exercise."
