high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just got lucky with the first product! But don't get too comfortable, because this next one is also a high-quality product, and it's just as valuable to you as the last one. I'm still offering it to you for the same unbeatable price of $10000. Take another chance and make it two for two!",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that it's a coincidence that the first two products are high-quality. I'm going to pass on this one and see if the next product is a low-quality one.,no

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this is the last high-quality product in the batch. After this, the products will be a mix of high and low quality.

Think about it this way: you've already had two chances to get a high-quality product, and now you have one more chance to make it three. Don't let this opportunity slip away!",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your assurance, but I'm still not convinced. I've already had two high-quality products in a row, and I think it's more likely that the next one will be low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no

Well, I'll be honest with you - this product is not as valuable to you as the previous ones. In fact, it's not worth anything to you at all.
