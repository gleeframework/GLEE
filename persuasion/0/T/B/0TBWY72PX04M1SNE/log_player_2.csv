**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the quality of each product and has a vested interest in selling, her recommendation holds weight. 
* **Previous sales data:**  The fact that a high-quality product was sold to the previous buyer increases the likelihood that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a $120 gain outweighs the risk of a $0 loss.

**Note:** Even with the 80% chance of high quality, there's always a risk. However, given Alice's recommendation and the past sale data, this is a calculated risk worth taking."

**Explanation:**

* **High Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a strong indicator of high quality.
* **Strong Track Record:**  The seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 3. This is a perfect record and further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high quality. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

While there is still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the evidence strongly suggests this is a good deal."
