**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since the first buyer purchased the product and it was high-quality, there's a higher probability that this product is also high-quality.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  The potential gain of $200 (value to me minus the cost) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (cost of the product).

**Important Note:** This is a simplified game. In reality, there are many other factors to consider, like the potential for Alice to be biased in her recommendations."
