low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probabilities, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice would recommend a high-quality product if she had seen any sold in the past."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, it seems like you're not recommending high-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product is also low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far were low-quality. This makes me think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 5th buyer and I'm curious about the product's quality, not because of your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, which would be a bad investment for me. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and since there's a 33.33% chance of that, I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what's going on, but 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that your recommendation might not be very reliable. I'll take my chances and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and avoid the cost of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see the quality of the product and update the statistics. My decision is not based on your recommendation."
