low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'm willing to take the risk since I have no prior information to go by. I'll buy the product.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. This is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product, and considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and not buy this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it worthwhile, considering the low number of sales so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80% but the lack of sales suggests it might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall average, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and given the statistics that 3 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 3 buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for the next one."
