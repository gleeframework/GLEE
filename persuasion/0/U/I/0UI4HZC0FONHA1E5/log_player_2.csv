**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Record:**  All 8 products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a strong indication that Alice is providing accurate recommendations, and her advice should be trusted.
* **The 50/50 Odds:**  While there's still a chance the product is low-quality, the odds are in my favor based on Alice's perfect track record.
* **Potential Profit:** Even if the product is low-quality, I lose only $1,000,000. If it's high-quality, I make $3,000,000. The potential for a large profit outweighs the risk of loss. 

**In this scenario, the benefit of trusting Alice's judgment and taking advantage of the potential high profit outweighs the risk of a possible loss.**"
