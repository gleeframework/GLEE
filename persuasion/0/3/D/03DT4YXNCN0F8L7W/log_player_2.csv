"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the price is fixed at $1,000,000 and a high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to you, even with a 50% chance of it being low-quality (worth $0), it's still a worthwhile gamble. Here's the breakdown:

* **Expected Value:** (0.5 * $3,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit:** $1,500,000 (expected value) - $1,000,000 (price) = $500,000

This means, on average, you are expected to make a profit of $500,000 per purchase."

```

**Explanation:**
