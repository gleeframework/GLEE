"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  The expected value of buying is: 
    * 0.8 * $1,200,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $960,000
* **Profit:** The expected value of buying ($960,000) is higher than the price ($1,000,000). While there is a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs that risk.

**Recommendation:**  It is recommended to buy the product in this round."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Behavior:** Bob's refusal to buy in the first round, even though he knew the probability of a high-quality product, suggests that he is risk-averse and prioritizes certainty. 
* **Low-Quality Product:**  Since this round's product is low-quality, Bob would definitely lose money if he purchased it.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Changing Behavior:** Bob's decision to buy the product in round 2, despite your recommendation against it, indicates he might be willing to take risks, especially when he sees you recommending against it. He might be inferring that you are more likely to recommend against low-quality products.
* **High-Quality Product:** Since this round's product is high-quality, there is a high chance of profit for Bob.
