""I understand you're being cautious, Bob. But think about it this way: if you don't take this product, someone else might. And you'll be left with nothing. I'm offering you a chance to make a fair deal, but I'm not making any promises about future opportunities. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you right now.""
