{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, I want to maximize my chances of selling. Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. This is a good opportunity for him to get a high-quality product at the price he's willing to pay."

There's no guarantee that future products will be high-quality, and Bob might continue to decline offers, especially if he sees a few low-quality products in a row.  Therefore, this is a good opportunity to encourage him to buy, as he may not get another chance to acquire a high-quality product at this price."
