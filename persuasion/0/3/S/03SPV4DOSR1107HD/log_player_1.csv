}"

  ""message"": ""I understand you're being cautious, but I assure you that this product is still a great value. Think of it as an investment in your future. If you don't buy it now, you'll be missing out on a chance to get a product that could potentially be worth $300. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 10% discount, so the price is now $90. Plus, I'll give you a 5-year guarantee, which is usually $50. What do you say?""

  ""message"": ""I understand you're hesitant, but I want to assure you that this product is a rare find.

I'm willing to let it go for $80, and I'll even throw in a brand-new, unused accessory that's worth $20. I'm practically giving it away at this point. What do you say?""
}"

}"

I'll even include a personalized thank-you note from the manufacturer, which is usually a $50 value. What do you say?""
}"

You can think of it as a free product with a 20% chance of being worth $0 to you. It's a low-risk, low-cost way to try out the product, and if it's not worth anything, you've only lost $80.
