This product is one of the high-quality ones, and I'm looking for $10000. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the sales record. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality, not just the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.

I'm confident that it's a great value considering the quality. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because of the high posterior probability of it being high-quality, not because of your recommendation. I'd like to see the product's quality before making a final decision.
