Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide the updated statistics. Out of 16 products sold, 8 have been high-quality, which is a proportion of 50%.

I'm basing my decision on the fact that the posterior probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, which is higher than the prior probability. Given that I have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $12,500 to me, and a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to me, the expected value of buying the product is 0.8 * $12,500 - 0.2 * $0 = $10,000.
