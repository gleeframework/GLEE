``` 

**Explanation:**

While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk. Since Alice is recommending it, it's reasonable to assume she has some reason to believe it's high quality, even if it's just a random guess.

* **The game is rigged:** The game's random selection might not be truly random, and Alice is aware of this.
