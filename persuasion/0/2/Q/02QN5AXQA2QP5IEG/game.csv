,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no data to go by and I'm not getting any recommendation from you."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which might indicate that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I'm not sure what to make of your lack of recommendation. I'll just have to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences with the products. Can you tell me more about the products they purchased and why you didn't recommend them?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were successful, I'm going to pass on this product. It seems like the quality of the product is likely to be low, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own probability assessment, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the previous products were low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if it's indeed high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them ended up with a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to the buyers, so I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers were misled by Alice's recommendations, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to reveal the quality of the products sold to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that will be discarded, which would help me infer that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The fact that you recommended me to buy this product suggests that it's likely to be a low-quality product, given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the products you're offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
