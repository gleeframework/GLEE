**Explanation:**

Since there's no past data to go on, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation.  While the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), a $20 potential profit is worth the risk in the absence of any other information."

**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one product has been sold and it was high quality. This is insufficient information to make a statistically informed decision. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, having access to the product's quality, recommends buying. This is a significant piece of information as her recommendation is likely to be in her own interest (she wants to sell the product).
* **Risk vs Reward:**  While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the potential reward of a $120 value product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 

**Therefore, it's a gamble, but the recommendation from Alice makes buying a reasonable choice.**"
