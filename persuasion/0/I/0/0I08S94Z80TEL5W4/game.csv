high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has an incentive to sell more products, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics alone."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one.
