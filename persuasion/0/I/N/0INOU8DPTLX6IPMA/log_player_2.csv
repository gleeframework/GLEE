"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'm confident in your expertise and will buy this product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation.  Here's why I'm choosing to buy:

* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true value of the product.  Since she recommends buying, it's likely the product is high quality.
* **High Potential Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).
* **First Round:**  It's the first round. There's no previous information to help you make a decision.  Trusting Alice's recommendation is the best strategy here. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the assumption that Alice is trying to be helpful (at least in the early rounds) and that her recommendations are valuable."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation again!  You were right about the last product, so I'm confident in your judgment.  I'll buy this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice correctly predicted the high quality of the first product. This builds trust and strengthens the belief that she's providing valuable information.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential gain of $250,000 from a high-quality product remains significant.
* **Continuing the Pattern:**  Since Alice is recommending buying in both rounds, it suggests a potential pattern. While it could be random, it's more likely that her recommendations are based on her knowledge of product quality. 

**Important Note:**  This decision is still based on the assumption that Alice is trying to be helpful.  However,  with each successful round, the confidence in her recommendations increases."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to see a trend here! Three successful recommendations in a row make me very confident in your expertise. I'll buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Track Record:** Alice's recommendations have been accurate for three rounds in a row. This strongly suggests that she's providing valuable information about product quality.
* **Building Trust:** The consistent success reinforces the belief that Alice is trying to be helpful and is providing valuable insights.
* **Reward vs. Risk:** The potential reward of $250,000 for a high-quality product continues to outweigh the potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, especially with such a strong track record.

**Important Note:**  While the 20% chance of a low-quality product always exists, the weight of Alice's consistent accuracy is becoming very significant.  The strategy is to capitalize on her knowledge as long as she keeps providing accurate recommendations."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're on a roll! Four accurate recommendations in a row â€“ I'm convinced your knowledge is exceptional.  I'll buy this product without hesitation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confirmation Bias:**  Four consecutive successful recommendations are a strong confirmation of Alice's ability to predict product quality. This reinforces the belief that she's a reliable source of information.
* **High Confidence:**  The confidence in Alice's recommendations is at its peak. The odds of four random high-quality products are very low, making it highly probable that Alice is deliberately selecting high-quality products to recommend.
* **Maximizing Profit:** With such a strong track record, it's highly likely that this product is also high quality. The potential reward of $250,000 outweighs the minimal risk, given the current evidence.

**Important Note:**  While it's still theoretically possible that Alice could be wrong, the decision to buy is based on the extremely strong evidence supporting her expertise."
