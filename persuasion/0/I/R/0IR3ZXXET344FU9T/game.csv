,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I'm the first one, and there's no data to go by. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality for myself."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice is enthusiastic about, which might indicate a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're recommending against it. Is there something specific that led you to this decision? And what's the overall proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you share that with me?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm not convinced that this product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The previous 4 buyers all passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products may be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
