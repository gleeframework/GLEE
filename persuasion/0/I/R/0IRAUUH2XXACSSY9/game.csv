high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommended it, but the only other buyer purchased a low-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the previous buyer didn't buy it, which suggests a high chance of it being low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product and the reason behind your recommendation?

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a better recommendation."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the recommendation and statistics after the 3rd buyer's decision, to get a better idea of the quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I think you're being overly cautious and I don't want the product to go to waste. I think there's still a 50% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's more likely that the next product will be low-quality. Therefore, I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a high-quality product."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a general discouragement."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
