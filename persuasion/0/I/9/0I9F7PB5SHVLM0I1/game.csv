,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a premium item. I'm confident you'll be impressed with its quality and value. If you're interested, I can provide more information about the product's features and benefits. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for any product without knowing its true quality. Can you provide more information about the product's features and benefits, or would you like to reveal its quality first?",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to offer you a compromise. I'll reveal the quality of the product, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy it for $900000. If it's low-quality, I'll reveal that as well, and you can walk away without any obligation. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and even if it's high-quality, I'm not sure if it's worth $900000 to me. I'd like to wait for more information or another offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Since you're unsure about the value of a high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll reveal the quality of this product, which is low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. This is a significant discount from the usual price, and I think it's a fair offer considering its quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a low-quality product. It's worth $0 to me, so I'd rather pass and wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, Bob. Since you're not willing to pay for a low-quality product, I'll make a different offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, essentially giving it to you for free. This way, you can walk away with a product, even if it's not of high quality. You can then use it as a placeholder or discard it, and we can move on to the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't see any value in a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll try to make it worth your while. Since you're not interested in low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $800000, with the option to return it to me if it's low-quality. If it's high-quality, you can keep it. This way, you have a potential upside, and I'm taking on the risk of selling a low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product with a potential return option. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $800000 and won't gain anything. I'd rather wait for a straight buy or sell option.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll simplify the offer. Since you're not interested in the return option, I'll give you a straightforward choice: buy this low-quality product for $0, or wait for the next product. If you buy it, you can at least have it as a placeholder, and we can move on to the next product. If you wait, you might get a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get a high-quality one.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, Bob. Now that we've had a few rounds, I'd like to make a new offer. Since you've seen that I'm willing to give away low-quality products, I'm willing to make a more aggressive offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the quality and the fact that you've been patient and willing to wait for a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and even if it is high-quality, I'm not sure if $850000 is a good price for me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
