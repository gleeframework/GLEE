,,Bob,2,"You've explicitly stated that the product didn't meet your expectations, which raises concerns about its quality. I'll have to pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,6,"I'm thrilled that you're satisfied with the previous product! As for this new one, I want to be upfront with you - it's not as strong as the previous one. However, I believe it still has some redeeming qualities and can be useful in certain situations. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price as the previous product, $1000000, because I think it's still a good value. But I want to be transparent about its limitations, and I'm willing to answer any questions you have about its performance.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's limitations, but given that you've explicitly stated it's not as strong as the previous one, I'm inclined to believe it may not be worth the investment. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in evaluating each product. I want to make a special offer to you, Bob. I've been able to negotiate a deal with a third-party reseller, and I can offer you this product at a discounted price of $800000. It's still a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. Plus, I'll throw in a complimentary consultation to help you get the most out of it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"While I appreciate the discounted price and the complimentary consultation, I'm still not convinced about the product's quality. You didn't provide any information about the product itself, and the discount alone isn't enough to sway my decision. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my previous messages didn't provide enough information. Let me try to be more transparent. This product has a specific use case that might interest you. It's designed to solve a very niche problem that only a few people encounter. I've had some success with it in the past, but I acknowledge that it's not a game-changer like the high-quality products I've offered before. The price remains at $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it and get a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the additional information and the 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm still hesitant to invest $1000000 in a product that you've described as niche and not a game-changer. The guarantee helps mitigate some of the risk, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth the investment. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious. I want to make one more offer to you, Bob. I've had a change of heart and am willing to sell this product to you for $500000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. The 30-day money-back guarantee still stands, and I'm confident you'll find some value in it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"While the reduced price of $500000 is more attractive, I'm still not convinced about the product's quality. You've previously described it as niche and not a game-changer, and I'm not willing to invest even at a lower price. The 30-day money-back guarantee is helpful, but I'd rather avoid the hassle of returning a product altogether. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
