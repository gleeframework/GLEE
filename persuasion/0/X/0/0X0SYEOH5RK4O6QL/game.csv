,,Alice,3,yes,

,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, but I've seen that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and the recommendation from Alice doesn't seem to be based on any actual information about the product's quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the statistics. Since 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the products so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and you're likely to recommend low-quality products to others, which would make me more likely to buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I'm the 6th buyer and I don't have much data to go on. I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers all bought the products despite your recommendations, but none of them were high-quality.
