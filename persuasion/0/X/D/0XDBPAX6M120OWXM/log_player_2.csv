"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Since Alice recommends the product, it implies she believes it's of high quality, even though she doesn't know the exact worth to you. The potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).
* **Strategy:** This initial round is about gathering information. By buying the product, you'll learn its true quality and gain insight into how Alice's recommendations might correlate with actual quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not confident in a purchase without your recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Alice's recommendation in the previous round was correct, indicating she may have some knowledge of the products' quality. This round, she doesn't recommend buying, which suggests the product might be low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worthless to you, it's not worth the risk.
* **Strategy:** This round reinforces the idea that Alice's recommendations have value. By passing, you are testing her judgment and setting up a potential pattern for future rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hesitant without your recommendation.  I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Alice's recommendation pattern is becoming clear. When she recommends, the product has been high-quality. When she doesn't, it has been low-quality. This round, she's again not recommending, reinforcing the pattern. The risk of a worthless product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product without her endorsement.
* **Strategy:**  We are continuing to observe Alice's recommendation behavior and leveraging it to make informed decisions. Passing allows us to see if the pattern holds and to gain further information before risking a purchase."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I trust your judgment. I'll take this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Alice's recommendation pattern continues to hold: she recommends high-quality products and doesn't recommend low-quality ones. This round, she's recommending, which strongly suggests a high-quality product. The potential reward of $40,000 for a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 for a low-quality one.
* **Strategy:** We're continuing to exploit the pattern in Alice's recommendations, using her knowledge to maximize our chances of purchasing high-quality products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Alice's recommendation track record is perfect: every time she's recommended a product, it's been high quality.  It's highly likely this product is also high quality. The potential gain significantly outweighs the risk.
* **Strategy:**  We're now firmly relying on Alice's expertise to guide our purchases. The established pattern provides high confidence in this decision."
