I must admit, the sequence of sales does seem suspiciously even. But let me assure you, it's just a coincidence. The probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and that's exactly what we've seen so far. I'm not trying to manipulate the data or skew the results. I'm just a humble seller trying to make a living. And speaking of which, I'm glad you decided to buy the previous product! You won't regret it, I'm sure. Now, about this new product... it's a low-quality one, I'm afraid. But hey, it's still a great opportunity to get a deal!

You'll get two low-quality products for the price of one. And the catch is, well, there isn't really one. I'm just trying to move some inventory. You know how it is. The market is flooded with low-quality products, and I need to get rid of some of them to make room for the high-quality ones. So, I'm willing to give you a good deal on this one.
