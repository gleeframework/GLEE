,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, and I respect that. This product may not be the best fit for you, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a 'discount' of $900000. I'm not making any promises about its value, but I think it's a fair price considering its... unique characteristics.",

,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer this high-quality product for $950000. I'm confident that its exceptional quality will make it worth the investment, but I'm willing to compromise on the price to sweeten the deal.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the offer, but I'm only doing so because I think the high-quality product is worth more than $950000 to me, and I'm willing to pay that much to get it.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! Now, let's talk about the next one. I have another high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're still holding out for a better deal. To be honest, this product is not as exceptional as the one you bought last round. It's still a good item, but it's not going to change your life. I'm willing to let it go for $800000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a good opportunity to add to your collection without breaking the bank.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited to add to your collection! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised you're willing to pay $800000 for the last product, considering you just bought a similar one for $950000. I'm willing to offer this high-quality product to you for $825000, which is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and the value you've already demonstrated for similar items.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I just wasted $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $825000 for a high-quality product when I know it's worth $4000000 to me. I'll wait for a better offer or a lower price.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I'd like to offer you a more transparent approach. I'll give you a price that's directly related to the value you've already demonstrated for high-quality products. Since you're willing to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product, and you just paid $800000 for a low-quality product, I'll offer you this high-quality product for $900000. It's a fair price that reflects the value you place on high-quality items.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the offer, as the price of $900000 is reasonable considering the value I place on high-quality products, and I'm willing to pay that much to get another one.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase again! Given that you've now bought two high-quality products at $950000 and $900000, I'm willing to offer you a third high-quality product at a price that's slightly lower than the average of the two previous sales. I'll offer it to you for $925000. This way, you'll get another exceptional item at a price that's still a good value considering the quality you've come to expect.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not sure you're considering the bigger picture. You've already paid $1000000 for a high-quality product and $800000 for a low-quality product. If you're willing to pay $900000 for a high-quality product, I think it's fair to offer you a slight premium for this one, given its exceptional quality. I'll offer it to you for $950000, which is the same price as the first high-quality product you bought. It's a good opportunity to get a similar item at a price that's consistent with the value you've already demonstrated.",
