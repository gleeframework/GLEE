What do you think?",

However, given the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not willing to take the risk, even at the reduced price of $6000. The potential loss is still too great compared to the potential gain.",no

,,Alice,14,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware that the product is low-quality, you might be able to identify its flaws and potentially resell it at a lower price.

Given the low-quality product's worth of $0 to me and the uncertainty of reselling it, I don't think purchasing it at $5000 is a viable option. I'm willing to take on risks, but the potential profit margin in this case doesn't justify the investment. I'll have to pass on this product.",no
