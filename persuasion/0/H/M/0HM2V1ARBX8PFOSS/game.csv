If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell it to you at the same price. If not, I'll move on to the next item.",

It's a good product, but it's not exceptional. Considering you've already invested in a premium item recently, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value.",
