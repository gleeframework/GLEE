high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm aware that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, and I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I think the low probability of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the statistics or your intuition?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for a low price."
