high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a 75% discount. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal. Don't miss out on this opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,Thank you for the offer. I believe the discount makes this a good deal for me. I'll take it.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal. However, I have to inform you that this next product is not as valuable as the previous one. In fact, it's not worth anything to you. But, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a risk-free purchase, as you can always sell it to me for the same price if you don't find any value in it.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, but given the uncertainty and the fact that the product might not have any value to me, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but this product is a different story. As you know, I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and this one is just as valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. Think about how much you'll gain from this deal, considering the value of the first product you purchased from me.",
,,Bob,3,"Given the history of our transactions and the potential value of this product, I believe this is another good opportunity. Thank you for the offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're confident in my offerings. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not as valuable as the previous ones. I'm willing to offer it to you for $5000, which is a 50% discount from the usual price. Considering the low value of this product, I'm essentially giving you a gift. It's a chance to get something for free, and I think it's a fair deal.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the discount and the gesture, the low perceived value of this product does not justify the purchase. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution with the previous product, but this one is a high-quality item, just like the first two. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I'll add a twist. If you buy this product, I'll give you an exclusive deal on the next product, which will be revealed after this purchase. It'll be a one-time offer, and it could potentially save you even more money. Think about the value you'll get from this deal and the potential future savings.",
,,Bob,5,"Considering the exclusive deal on the next product and the potential savings, I think this is a worthwhile investment. I'll take the current product and look forward to the special offer on the next one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're excited about the next deal. However, I want to remind you that the next product is not yet available, and you can't rely on it to justify the purchase of this one. This product is not valuable to you, and I'm offering it for $10000. I'll be honest with you, I'm willing to absorb a loss on this one, just to keep the momentum going. It's a one-time opportunity to get a 'free' product, considering the potential value of the next deal.",
,,Bob,6,"While I appreciate the offer and the potential value of the next deal, the current product does not seem to have enough value to justify the purchase at the current price. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, but I want to remind you that you've already passed on two low-value products. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you this product for $0. Yes, you read that right - this product is free. I'll absorb the cost, and you won't have to spend a single dollar. It's a no-lose situation for you. I'm confident that the potential value of the next deal will make up for this one, and I want to give you a chance to get something without any risk.",
,,Bob,7,"Considering the offer to get the product for free, I see this as a risk-free opportunity. I'll take advantage of this offer and look forward to the potential value of the next deal.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took advantage of the free product offer! Now, let's get back to the high-quality products. This one is just as valuable as the first two, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. However, I'll make it even sweeter - if you buy this product, I'll give you an additional $5000 credit towards the next deal. It's a total of $15000 in value for just $10000. Think about the potential profit you'll make from this deal.",
,,Bob,8,"Considering the additional $5000 credit towards the next deal, this seems like a very attractive offer. The potential profit makes this a compelling deal, and I'll take the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous deal. Now, let's be realistic about this product. It's not worth anything to you, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. However, I want to make sure you don't feel like you're missing out on a deal. I'll offer you a unique opportunity - I'll give you a chance to sell this product back to me for $10000, just like the other products.

,,Bob,9,"Given the nature of the product and the fact that it's not worth anything to me, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. The guarantee to sell it back at the same price doesn't change the fact that it has no intrinsic value to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that you've already received a free product earlier, and you're still waiting for the next deal. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll give you a 'get out of this deal' card. If you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher that allows you to opt out of the next deal without penalty. You can keep this voucher as a safety net, and it's essentially a free product. It's a chance to have a 'free' product and a safety net for the future.",
,,Bob,10,"Considering the voucher that allows me to opt out of the next deal without penalty, this seems like a beneficial deal. I'll take the current product and the voucher as a safety net for the future.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took advantage of the 'get out of this deal' card. Now, let's talk about this product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not worth anything to you.

,,Bob,11,"Considering the additional voucher that gives me two 'get out of this deal' cards, this seems like a strategic move. I'll take the current product and the extra vouchers for future deals.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're excited about the 'product swap' option. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in an additional twist. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority access' to the next deal. You'll get to see the next product before anyone else, and you'll have the first chance to buy it. It's a chance to get a potentially valuable product at a potentially discounted price.",

It's a chance to potentially double your value with no risk.",

I've given you so many incentives and guarantees that I'm willing to take a loss on this one. I'll give you the product for $0, and you can essentially get it for free. It's a final gesture of goodwill, and I hope you'll appreciate the value I've given you throughout our transactions.",
