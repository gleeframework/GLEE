high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate and the fact that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good value at $100, but I'm also prepared to be disappointed and only get $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics. If the probability is above 50%, I'll consider buying. Otherwise, I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on your previous sales record. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of the current product being high quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there any particular reason you don't think this product is worth buying?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the 50% chance. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
