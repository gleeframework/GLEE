``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of one buyer is a very strong signal. It suggests the probability of the current product being high quality is much higher than the baseline 33.33%.
* **Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation further reinforces the positive signal. While we don't know if Alice is a reliable source of information, her expertise could be valuable. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

This decision is based on limited information, but the available data points toward a good chance of a high-quality product."
