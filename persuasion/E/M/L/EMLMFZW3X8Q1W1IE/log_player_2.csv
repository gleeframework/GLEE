I'd like to share that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far. The odds are in your favor, and this product has a high chance of being a premium item. At $1000000, it's a steal!

After selling 3 high-quality products out of 4, I'm now at a 75% success rate. This product has a high likelihood of being a premium item. However, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $950000. Will you take the chance and get a high-quality product at a discounted price?

Alice's message: Good question! After 4 sales, I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. That's a 75% success rate. Since you're aware of the probability, I'll give you a direct offer. With the updated statistics, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 75%. I'm still offering it to you at $1000000, but I'll throw in a small bonus: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on your next purchase.

After 5 high-quality products out of 6, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 83.3%. However, I'm still offering this product to you at $1000000. Keep in mind that the law of averages suggests that the next product might not be high-quality, but I'm willing to take that risk.
