"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of purchasing the product is:

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $1,600,000.

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it is highly recommended that Bob buys the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'm going to buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has already purchased one product and knows it was high-quality, the information about past products doesn't change the probability of this round's product being high-quality. 

This round's product still has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000

Therefore, it's still highly recommended that Bob buys the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks again for the recommendation!  I'm feeling confident about this one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000

Therefore, it's still highly recommended that Bob buys the product in this round."

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has had a streak of good luck with high-quality products, the probability of a product being high-quality is always 80%. This round's product has a 20% chance of being low-quality. 

The expected value calculation for this round is:

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000
