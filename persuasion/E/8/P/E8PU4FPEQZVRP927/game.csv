I've sold one high-quality product already, and I'm confident that the next one will be just as good. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a steal if I do say so myself. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've got to love the law of averages, right? I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I think it's worth noting that I've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products recently. Maybe I'm just due for a high-quality one? Or maybe I'm just getting unlucky. Either way, I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a great reward. What do you say?",

I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, though - the law of averages says that the next product has a 50% chance of being low-quality. But if you're feeling lucky, I think you'll be happy with this one.",

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm starting to think that I might be selling a streak of high-quality products. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling pretty confident about it. But I also want to be transparent - the law of averages says that the next product has a 50% chance of being low-quality. What do you think? Want to ride the wave of good luck?",

I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to bet that it's another high-quality one.
