high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll have the opportunity to buy another product in the next round, which could potentially be even more valuable. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and you'll have to wait for the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I don't know what the next product will be. I'm hoping it's high quality, but I'm also hoping you're not trying to manipulate me into buying this one by making the next one look more attractive.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put your mind at ease. I'll give you a simple offer: I'll sell you the next product for $900000. If you buy it, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product after this one will be sold to you for $800000. This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the value you're getting, and you can make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in the guarantee, and I don't think the discount is enough to make up for the fact that I've already bought a high-quality product from you. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a significantly lower price. I'm offering it to you for $200000. Keep in mind that this is a rare opportunity to get a product at a price that's a fraction of its market value. It's a risk, but it could also be a great value.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for the 'low-quality product at a great price' trap. I know it's a low-quality product and it's worth $0 to me, so I'm not interested in buying it at any price.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I respect that. Given your experience with the previous high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a more substantial discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $750000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you've already received from the previous high-quality product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying it. I know the discount is just a way to make the low-quality product seem more attractive, and I'm not interested in paying $750000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,5,"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to manipulate you. This time, I'm offering a straightforward deal. I'll sell you the high-quality product for $800000, which is the same price I offered for the next product in Round 2. I'm not offering any discounts or guarantees. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying it at $800000. I know the product is worth $1200000 to me, and I'm not paying 33% less than its true value just because you're offering it to me. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I see you're a shrewd negotiator. I respect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you the high-quality product for $1000000, which is the original price I offered for the first product. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's closer to its true value, and you'll still have the opportunity to buy another product in the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take it. I'm willing to pay the original price, especially since I know the product is high-quality and worth $1200000 to me. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, let's talk about the next product. I'm offering it to you for $950000. I think this price reflects the value you've received from the previous high-quality products, and it's a fair price for a product that I'm confident is high-quality.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying it. I've already bought two high-quality products from you, and I'm not sure what the next product is. I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product that could be either high-quality or low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Bob, I understand your caution. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products from me, I'm willing to offer you a very low price for this product. I'll sell it to you for $50000. I know it's a significant discount, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the value.",
