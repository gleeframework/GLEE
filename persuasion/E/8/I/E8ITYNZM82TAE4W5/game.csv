low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this product and hope that it's low-quality, so that it gets discarded and I don't waste my money."
