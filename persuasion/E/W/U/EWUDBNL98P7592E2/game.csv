,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it purely based on the initial conditions and the lack of information. I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to get some information from Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll buy the product and see what I get.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're recommending now might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer, based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it on the past sales data or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a product that has been recommended by Alice, especially with the current statistics showing 0 high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, it suggests that the products offered to them were likely low quality. Since the probability of a product being low quality is 66.67%, it's likely that the product offered to me is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
