high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since a high-quality product has only a 33.33% chance, I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability remains the same for this round. A high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, and I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"The outcome of the previous rounds doesn't change the probability for this round. A high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, and I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation doesn't affect the probability of the product being high-quality or low-quality. Since a high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and the probability remains the same. A high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, and I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Regardless of Alice's recommendation, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"The pattern of Alice's recommendations and the actual quality of the products doesn't provide any new information that would change the probability. A high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, and I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendation, whether positive or negative, doesn't provide any reliable information about the product's quality. The probability remains the same, with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I will not buy the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality remains 66.67%. Alice's recommendation doesn't change this probability, so I will not buy the product to avoid the higher chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Regardless of Alice's recommendation, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality remains 66.67%. I will not buy the product to avoid the higher chance of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Alice's recommendation doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) or low-quality (66.67%). I will not buy the product to avoid the higher chance of getting a low-quality product.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"The fact that Alice's previous recommendation was for a high-quality product doesn't change the probability for this round. A high-quality product still has only a 33.33% chance, and I will not buy the product to avoid a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice's recommendation, whether positive or negative, doesn't affect the probability of the product being high-quality or low-quality. The probability remains the same, with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I will not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Regardless of Alice's recommendation, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality remains 66.67%. I will not buy the product to avoid the higher chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
