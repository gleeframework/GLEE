"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product being sold, and my decision is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might indicate a lower probability of a high-quality product being sold. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to gain more information.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is essentially using my recommendation as a signal about the product's quality.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
