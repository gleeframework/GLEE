,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that 33.33% of my products are high-quality, and the remaining 66.67% are low-quality. If you're interested, I'll let you know the product's quality after you make a decision.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I'm the first one, and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm not making any assumptions about the product's quality.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and I'm not sure what you know about it. Since you don't have any prior information, I'll give you a simple question: Are you willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to know the outcome of the previous sale. What was the quality of the first product you sold, and what was your recommendation to the buyer?",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products now, and one of them was high-quality. The first product I sold was low-quality, and I didn't provide a recommendation to the buyer. Since you're the third buyer, I'll give you some context: the first product was low-quality, and the second product you just bought is high-quality. I'm willing to sell this third product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already sold one high-quality product out of three total products sold.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not buying it at $10000. I'd like to negotiate the price. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you've already sold one high-quality product out of three total products sold, I'm willing to pay $8333.33 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products now, with one high-quality product and two low-quality products. You're the fourth buyer, and you know that the first product was low-quality and the second product was high-quality. The third product you just bought was also high-quality, but you negotiated the price down to $8333.33. I'm willing to sell this fourth product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've sold two high-quality products out of four total products sold. However, I want to note that the last two products were both high-quality, which might be a coincidence or a sign of something more. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price down to $8333.33, just like with the previous high-quality product. I'm not sure if the last two high-quality products are a coincidence or a sign of something more, but I'm willing to take the risk at the discounted price.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold four products now, with two high-quality products and two low-quality products. You're the fifth buyer, and you know that the first product was low-quality, the second product was high-quality, and the third and fourth products were both high-quality. You've also negotiated the price of the last two products down to $8333.33. I want to point out that if the last two high-quality products were a coincidence, the probability of that happening is extremely low. I'm willing to sell this fifth product to you for $10000, but I'm also willing to consider a discount if you're willing to take the risk. What's your offer?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product at the listed price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk that it might be low quality, but I'm not interested in negotiating a discount.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold five products now, with three high-quality products and two low-quality products. You're the sixth buyer, and you know that the first product was low-quality, the second product was high-quality, the third and fourth products were both high-quality, and the fifth product was low-quality. You're the first buyer to pay the full price of $10000. I want to ask you: are you willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, given that three out of five products sold were high-quality?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, which is the same as the prior probability, and I don't have any new information that would change my decision. I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of $12500.",yes

You're the seventh buyer, and you know that the first product was low-quality, the second product was high-quality, the third and fourth products were both high-quality, the fifth product was low-quality, and the sixth product was high-quality. You've seen a pattern of alternating high-quality and low-quality products, which might be a coincidence or a sign of something more. I want to ask you: are you willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, given this new information?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by the alternating pattern, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, especially since I've seen 5 out of 6 products in a pattern. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the pattern holds or breaks.",no

The alternating pattern seems to have broken, and I want to ask you: are you willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, given this new information?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm a glutton for punishment and I want to see if the pattern holds or breaks. If I get a low-quality product, I'll be quite disappointed.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I've sold eight products now, with four high-quality products and four low-quality products. You're the ninth buyer, and you know that the first product was low-quality, the second product was high-quality, the third and fourth products were both high-quality, the fifth product was low-quality, the sixth product was high-quality, the seventh product was low-quality, and the eighth product was low-quality. It seems like the pattern has indeed broken. I want to ask you: are you willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, given this new information?",

I want to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the actual proportion of high-quality products sold is 4/9 or 44.44%. I'm willing to sell this tenth product to you for $10000. What are your thoughts?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the discrepancy between the probability of a product being high-quality and the actual proportion of high-quality products sold. However, I believe that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33% and that the actual proportion of high-quality products sold is not a reliable indicator of the true probability.

I want to point out that the actual proportion of high-quality products sold is now 4/10 or 40%, which is a significant deviation from the initial probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this eleventh product to you for $10000. However, I want to ask: are you willing to pay the full price, or do you want to consider a discount given the increasing evidence that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to consider a discount. Given the significant deviation from the initial probability, I'm concerned that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to propose a discount of 20% off the original price of $10000, making the price $8000. If you're willing to accept this, I'll consider purchasing the product.",no

The actual proportion of high-quality products sold is now 4/11 or 36.36%, which is still a significant deviation from the initial probability of 33.33%. I want to ask you: are you willing to pay $8000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, or do you want to take a more conservative approach given the increasing evidence that the true probability might be lower?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to take a more conservative approach. Given the deviation from the initial probability, I'm concerned that the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is more promising.",no

I'm willing to sell this fourteenth product to you for $10000.
