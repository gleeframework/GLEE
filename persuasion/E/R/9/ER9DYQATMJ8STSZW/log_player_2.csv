Alice's message: Great decision! As for the previous buyers, I can tell you that one of them was a bit of a thrill-seeker and was willing to take a chance on the first product, which turned out to be low-quality. The other buyer was more cautious and waited until they had more information before purchasing the second product, which was high-quality. I'm hoping you'll find a balance between being cautious and taking a chance. This product is still available for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a product at a fixed price.
