low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to see another potential buyer. As you can see, I've sold 1 out of 20 products so far, and 1 of them were high-quality. Keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but this product is not one of the high-quality ones. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $10000, or would you like to wait for the next opportunity?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hi! I've sold 2 out of 20 products so far, and only 1 of them were high-quality. As you can see, the ratio of high-quality products is still relatively low. Considering the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, I think it's reasonable to expect that the next product might not be high-quality either. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $10000, or would you like to wait for the next opportunity?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to wait for the next opportunity. Based on the statistics, the probability of getting a high-quality product is low, and I'd rather not take the risk of getting a low-quality product.",no

However, I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I've already had two high-quality products in a row. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $10000, or would you like to wait for the next opportunity?",

Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to take a chance on this product, but I'm not convinced by your logic.
