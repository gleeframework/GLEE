}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on your sales record. I'm hoping to make a profit if it is high-quality, but I'm prepared to lose $100 if it's low-quality.

}"

With the recent trend, I think it's likely to be high-quality!""

It's a fair price, considering the odds are back to normal.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm still a bit skeptical. If I'm right, I'll get a good deal, but if I'm wrong, I'll be out $100. Can I ask, do you have any idea why the first two buyers passed on the products despite the statistics looking normal?

As for the first two buyers, I can tell you that they were simply being cautious and didn't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100. They were waiting for more information before making a decision. But now that you've bought the last product, you know that the probability is back to 50%! This one is the 10th product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, regardless of its quality!""

This one is the 11th product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, either way!""

However, considering the last 3 products I've sold were low-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower.

Since I've sold 6 high-quality products, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually 60% (6/11). This one is the 12th product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, either way!""
