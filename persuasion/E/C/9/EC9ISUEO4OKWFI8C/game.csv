,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

With 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 80% chance. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
