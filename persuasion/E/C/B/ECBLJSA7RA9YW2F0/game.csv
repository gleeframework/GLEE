,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, I estimate the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I also know that this is an anomaly and the probability should be 33.33%. Therefore, I will pass on the product to see if the probability will be more representative in the next sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' purchases are a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know its true value is $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, I'd rather pass on this one."

,,Alice,16,yes,
