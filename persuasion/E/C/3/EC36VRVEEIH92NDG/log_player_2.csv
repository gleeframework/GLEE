**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know Alice's recommendation and the sales record. There's no information about the quality of the products offered to the previous two buyers. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is against buying. This is significant because Alice knows the true quality of the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,500 is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product is even higher. The odds are heavily against getting a high-quality product. 

**Conclusion:**  It's wiser to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation and the high probability of it being low quality."
