**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** Since the product is high-quality, it is worth $12,500 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price is $10,000, which is less than the value of a high-quality product.
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about the specific product's quality, but they know the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the uncertainty, the buyer is likely to profit from purchasing the product. The expected value is calculated as: 
    * (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
    * (0.3333 * $12,500) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,166.25 

Since the expected value ($4,166.25) is positive, it is generally recommended to purchase the product."
