low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low quality. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to buy it, but if it's low quality, I'll be disappointed. I'm taking a risk, but I think the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this one and don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is relatively low."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, it seems that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, and given that 3 previous buyers have also purchased, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'll pass on the opportunity to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice is more likely to recommend low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to be bought, which might indicate a higher likelihood of it being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice is recommending the product, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 3 buyers didn't find any high-quality products and the low probability of the product being high quality (33.33%)"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the statistics again before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product being available."
