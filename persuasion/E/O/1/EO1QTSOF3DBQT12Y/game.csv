,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can potentially get a $12500 value for it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high-quality, and the fact that she didn't recommend it might make it more likely to be high-quality, given the low overall success rate of her recommendations so far."
