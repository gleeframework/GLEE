Alice's message: I understand your caution from the previous round. I want to assure you that I have sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is even lower. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a price that's already a discount from its actual value. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great opportunity for you.

I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 'double or nothing' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price.
