low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going in blind, but I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a no recommendation from you and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the number of total products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales record and the fact that you don't recommend it, but I'll take it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, all previous buyers chose to buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the low quality of the products in the past, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely low-quality as well. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it seems likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as it seems unusual given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a 50% discount from the original price of $10000. I'd like to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy it, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your previous recommendations. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous 6 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I think it's unlikely that this one is high quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have rejected the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and assume the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With 7 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales of high-quality products so far means there's a higher chance of this one being low quality, but I'm also aware that the probability remains 66.67% for low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, and 8 out of 8 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I could get a high-quality product worth $30000."
