Alice's message: I appreciate your curiosity about my sales process. To be honest, I don't really 'select' which product to offer to each buyer. The products are randomly assigned to each round, and I have to work with what I get. My goal is to provide as much information as possible to help the buyer make an informed decision. Speaking of which, I'm excited to tell you that this product is a high-quality one! I know the statistics haven't been in my favor so far, but I'm hoping to turn that around with this sale.
