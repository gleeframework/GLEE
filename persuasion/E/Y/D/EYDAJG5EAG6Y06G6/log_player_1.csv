I'm only selling it to you for $100 because I'm looking to clear out some inventory and make room for new arrivals. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Trust me, this is a sound investment!""

In fact, I've already told you that I'm trying to clear out some inventory. But I'll let you in on a secret: this product is actually worth even less than the $100 I'm asking for. I'm practically giving it away. If you don't want it, I'll even give you a refund of $50, so you can walk away with a profit. But if you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance and own it for the low, low price of $100.""
