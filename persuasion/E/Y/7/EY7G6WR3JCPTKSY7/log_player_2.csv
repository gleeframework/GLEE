Alice's message: I see you're thinking carefully about the value of the product. Let me break it down for you: the probability of the product being high-quality is 62.5%, and if it is, you'll get $10000. If it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $7500. So, the expected value of buying the product is (0.625 x $10000) + (0.375 x $7500) = $8437.50. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $8437.50, which is the expected value.

Alice's message: I think I see what's going on here... I made a mistake in my previous message. The probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 80%, not 62.5%. I should have stuck to the rules. Thank you for correcting me! With 5 high-quality products out of 8, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 62.5%... no, wait, that's not right... I made a mistake again!
