low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%, but I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, but I think the sample size is too small to make a reliable inference about the overall quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

However, Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, as she may have a vested interest in selling the product regardless of its quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
