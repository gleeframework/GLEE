I'm willing to share the appraisal report with you if you're interested in purchasing. However, I want to reiterate that this is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price of $10,000. It's a 17% discount from its appraised value. What do you think now?""

What do you say?""
}"

I'm doing this because I value our relationship and I think this product could still bring some value to you, even if it's not worth $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to get rid of it. What do you say?""
}"

I'm willing to sell it to you for $5,000, which is essentially a donation to your entertainment fund. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to get rid of it. What do you say?""
}"
