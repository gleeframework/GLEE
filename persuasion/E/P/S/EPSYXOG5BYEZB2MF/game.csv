high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No pressure! I completely understand. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I want to give you a hint about the value of high-quality products. I've had a few customers who have bought high-quality products from me, and they've reported being extremely satisfied with their purchases. They've even been willing to pay up to $120 for similar products. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100?",

,,Alice,7,"I understand your strategy! You're trying to maximize the value of each product. This next one is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I want to give you a more concrete example of the increasing value. Let's say you were to buy 5 high-quality products from me, and each one is worth $10 more than the previous one.
