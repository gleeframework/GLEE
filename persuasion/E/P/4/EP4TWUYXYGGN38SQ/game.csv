low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's worth $12500 to me, so it's worth taking the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, given the statistics. If 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products being offered might be low-quality, which could make the one I'm being offered more likely to be high-quality."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that 5 previous buyers have also bought the products with no high-quality products sold yet.

,,Alice,16,no,
