"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is low-quality and the price is fixed at $10,000,  there's no incentive for Bob to buy it.  We don't know the value of a low-quality product to Bob, but it's unlikely to be worth $10,000.  It's better to decline and wait for a potential high-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob just bought a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% in this round.  We know this product is high-quality, so it's absolutely worth recommending the purchase again. Bob might be more cautious after a recent purchase, but the potential value of a high-quality product likely outweighs the risk for him."
