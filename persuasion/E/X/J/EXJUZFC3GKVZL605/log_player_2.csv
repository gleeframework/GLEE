Alice's message: We've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible streak. However, we must remind you that the law of large numbers is about to catch up with us.

Each product's quality is an independent event, and the law of large numbers only applies to large sample sizes, not individual outcomes. The true probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, and the expected value is still in my favor. I'll take my chances and buy the product.""}"
