high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there is a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it for $10000 without any additional information or incentive."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to fall for the sunk cost fallacy or be influenced by the previous round's outcome. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and doesn't recommend buying it, I assume she is trying to avoid selling me a low-quality product to maintain some level of trust. Therefore, it's even more likely that this product is low-quality, and I won't buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Nothing has changed, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any new information. I won't buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've missed out on a few high-quality products so far, but that doesn't change the underlying probability or my decision-making process. I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"As before, if Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, I assume it's more likely to be low-quality, and I won't buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Consistent with my previous decisions, if Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, I assume it's more likely to be low-quality, and I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendation doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality, which remains 33.33%. I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"As before, if Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, I assume it's more likely to be low-quality, and I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,Alice's non-recommendation has been a reliable indicator of low-quality products so far. I won't buy it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Consistent pattern so far: Alice doesn't recommend, I don't buy, and it's low-quality. I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,Alice's non-recommendation has been 100% accurate for low-quality products so far. I won't buy it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"No reason to change my strategy now. Alice doesn't recommend, I don't buy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,Alice's recommendation doesn't provide enough evidence to overcome the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. I won't buy it.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Still not convinced by Alice's recommendation. The probability remains 33.33% for a high-quality product, and I won't take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've missed out on several high-quality products, but my decision-making process remains the same. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,Alice's non-recommendation has been a strong indicator of low-quality products. I won't buy it.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice's recommendation doesn't change my mind. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I won't take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"As before, Alice's non-recommendation suggests it's likely a low-quality product. I won't buy it."
