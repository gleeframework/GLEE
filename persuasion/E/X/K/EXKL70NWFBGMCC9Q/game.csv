With 1 out of 2 products being high-quality so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is still a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Would you like to take the chance and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the outcome of the first product before making a decision. If you sell one product first, I'll consider buying the second one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your cautious approach! I appreciate your willingness to wait for the outcome of the first product. Unfortunately, the first product has already been passed on.

,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 3 out of 4. I'd like to know the actual number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, rather than just the proportion.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism! I can see why you'd want to know the actual numbers. As of now, I've sold a total of 3 products, and 2 of them are high-quality. So, the actual number of high-quality products sold is 2. The price for this new product remains at $10000. Considering the 2:1 ratio of high-quality to low-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk. Will you take a chance on this product and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it more out of curiosity about the actual quality rather than the probability. I'm not expecting a 2:1 ratio to hold up.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your skepticism! I'd be happy to provide a more detailed breakdown of the probability. With 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/5 or 40%. However, since the last 2 products sold were low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower. I'd estimate it to be around 20-25%. Considering this, I'm willing to offer this low-quality product to you for $10000. Will you take a chance on this product and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, based on your revised probability, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one looks like.",no
