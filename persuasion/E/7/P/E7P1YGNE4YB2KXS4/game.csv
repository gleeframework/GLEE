I'm not giving away any information about this product's quality, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were low-quality. But this one is high-quality! I'm glad I could finally offer you a chance to buy a high-quality product. Considering my previous sales, you might think I'm due for a high-quality product, and this could be the one. The price is still $10000, but I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm aware that my previous low-quality sales might have made you more cautious. I'm still offering this product for $10000, and I'm hoping you'll give it a chance.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'm going to do some calculations to determine the expected value. If the product is high-quality, I'll buy it for $10000, which is a good deal. If it's low-quality, I'll get nothing. Based on the previous sales record, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The expected value of buying the product is therefore (0.3333 * 12500) + (0.6667 * 0) = 4166.67. Since this is greater than the price of $10000, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes
