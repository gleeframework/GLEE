**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product randomly.
* **Alice's knowledge:** Alice knows the true value of each product to the buyer.  This means her recommendation is based on something more than just random chance.

While there's still a chance the current product is low-quality, the data strongly suggests Alice is providing valuable information. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward (a high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss (a low-quality product)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!
