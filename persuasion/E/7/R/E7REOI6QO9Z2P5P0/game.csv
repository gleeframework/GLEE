I'll let you in on a little secret: my sales record shows that 1 out of 3 products I sell are top-notch. This one might just be the best of the bunch. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I'm confident you'll see its true value. What do you say? Will you take it home?",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's the high-quality one!,yes

I'll let you in on a little more information: my sales record shows that 1 out of 3 products I sell are top-notch, and I've sold 1 of them so far. That means there's a 66.67% chance this product is not the high-quality one. I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are against it being the good one. What do you say? Will you take the risk?",

However, I've also sold 1 low-quality product, so I want to be transparent with you. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are against it being the good one. Still, it's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take a chance?",

I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, and I'll give you the same 'get out of one bad product' free card I offered last time.
