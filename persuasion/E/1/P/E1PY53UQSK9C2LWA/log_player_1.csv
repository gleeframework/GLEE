They valued the potential upside of getting a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, and were willing to pay the full price for the opportunity.

I believe this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price, especially considering the increased likelihood of the remaining products being high-quality.""}"

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not sure if the probability of the product being high-quality is 55.56% as you mentioned.
