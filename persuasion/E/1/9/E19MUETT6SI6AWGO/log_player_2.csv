I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a high-quality product coming up next, and I think it's going to be a game-changer. This one, on the other hand, is a bit of a throwaway. I'm willing to let it go for a song, just to get it off my hands. How about $950000?

Alice's message: No worries, I completely understand. You've got a great collection and you're happy with it.

It's a loss for me, but I'd rather get something out of it than nothing at all. If you're feeling generous, I'd appreciate it if you'd take it off my hands.
