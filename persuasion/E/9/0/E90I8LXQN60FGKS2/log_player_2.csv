**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since Alice knows the true quality and is recommending the purchase, it's highly likely the product is high quality. 
* **Past Data Supports It:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0 - $10,000 = -$10,000). 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information provided and the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that benefits her (i.e., she wants to sell products). There's always a risk, but in this scenario, the odds are in favor of a high-quality product."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The statistics are positive:** 3 out of 3 products sold were high quality. This strongly suggests that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, combined with the positive statistics, significantly increases the perceived probability of the product being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain of $2,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

While there's still a chance of the product being low quality, the evidence strongly suggests it's worth the gamble."
