**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since all 2 previous buyers purchased products and they were both high quality, this suggests a strong likelihood of high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the belief that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on the information provided and the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that aligns with her own best interests (i.e., she wants to sell products and gain positive feedback). In a real-world scenario, there might be other factors to consider, such as Alice's potential bias or a lack of transparency in her recommendations."

**Explanation:**

Given the information provided:

* **The product's quality is unknown.**  There's a 50/50 chance it's high or low quality.
* **Alice's recommendation is favorable.**  While not foolproof, her recommendation indicates she believes the product is likely high quality. 
* **Historical data is positive.** 100% of products sold so far have been high quality. 

**Since the potential reward (a high-quality product worth $120) outweighs the potential loss (a low-quality product worth $0), it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product.**  

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. A more nuanced strategy would consider the potential for Alice to be biased in her recommendations (e.g., to increase sales)."
