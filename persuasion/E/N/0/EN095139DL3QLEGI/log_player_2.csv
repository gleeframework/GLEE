Alice's message: Welcome to my store! You're in luck because I've got a special deal for you. Since the last buyer took a chance on the first product, I've got a new one that's just as great. In fact, I'm so confident in this one that I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the previous one: $10000. But don't worry, I'm not just trying to get rid of it - this product has been thoroughly inspected and is in perfect working condition. It's a real steal at this price! What do you say?

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the updated statistics. So far, I've had 3 potential buyers, and 1 of them bought a high-quality product. That means I have 2 high-quality products left out of a total of 5 products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is therefore 2/5 or 40%. On the other hand, the probability of getting a low-quality product is 3/5 or 60%. With that in mind, I'm still willing to offer you this new product at $10000. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this deal?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information about the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products. Since I'm offering a new batch of products, I can tell you that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 1:1. This means that out of every 2 products, 1 is high-quality and 1 is low-quality. However, I can also tell you that the batch I'm offering now has a slightly different composition than the previous ones. I've had a few more high-quality products in the previous batches, so the overall probability of getting a high-quality product is slightly higher. But I want to be transparent about the distribution, so I'm willing to offer you a product that's randomly selected from the batch. If you buy this product, there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality. What do you say? Will you take the chance and get this amazing deal?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to explain the process. The probability of getting a high-quality product is calculated based on the sales record.
