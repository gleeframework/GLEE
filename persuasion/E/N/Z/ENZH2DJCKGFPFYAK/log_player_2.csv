Round 6
Alice's message: I appreciate your appreciation for transparency and certainty. However, I'd like to take a different approach this time. I'll be completely honest with you - this product is not one of our top-quality items. It's a bit of a 'clearance' item, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000 because I need to make some space in our inventory. I'm not asking for a money-back guarantee or any other concessions, but I am offering you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you're not satisfied, you can return it at any time, no questions asked.
