"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. While I don't know the exact value Bob places on high-quality products, there's a 50% chance the product is worth more than $10,000 to him.  Therefore, recommending the purchase has a good chance of resulting in a sale and a potential profit."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the first product, which was high-quality. This suggests he likely values high-quality products at least as much as the $10,000 price.  Since this round's product is also high-quality, recommending the purchase again is likely to result in another sale."
