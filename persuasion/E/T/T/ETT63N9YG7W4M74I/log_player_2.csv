**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Record:** The provided statistics show that all 11 products sold so far were high-quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice is making accurate recommendations. 
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($125) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0). This makes buying a favorable decision from a purely financial perspective. 

It's important to note that this strategy relies on the assumption that Alice is truly trying to help buyers acquire high-quality products. If there is suspicion that Alice might be manipulating the information or recommending low-quality products, a different approach might be necessary."
