I'm not one to exaggerate, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. This product is worth $200 to you, and I'm offering it to you for just $100. It's a steal!

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total sales so far, and I'm willing to bet that this next one is just as good. The odds are in your favor!

Alice's message: I see you're a numbers person. Alright, I'll give it to you straight. I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. That means there's a 66.67% chance it's a low-quality product. But think about it, the potential reward is worth the risk! You could get a $200 product for just $100. And if you don't like it, you can always try to negotiate with the next buyer. But I'm not making any promises about that.

That's a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is actually lower than the overall probability. But don't let that discourage you! This product is still a great opportunity to get a deal on a potentially worthless item. You can't lose, right?

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious buyer. I don't blame you! But let me ask you, have you considered the law of large numbers? With 5 sales under my belt, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, just like it was from the start. It's just that the sample size is still small. But I'll give you a hint: I've got a lot more products left, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. It's a small price to pay for the chance to be one of the lucky ones!

Alice's message: The law of large numbers says that as I sell more and more products, the proportion of high-quality products will converge to the true probability of 33.33%. But, as you've seen, it's still early days for me, and the sample size is small. However, I'll give you a special deal on this one. If you buy it, I'll give you a 'free' chance to buy another product at the same price, and I'll reveal the quality of both products to you. It's a 2-for-1 deal, essentially!

I've sold 8 products now, and the proportion of high-quality products is still 12.5%. But I'm confident that it'll get closer to 33.33% soon.
