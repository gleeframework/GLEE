,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in the next product, but I want to make it clear that this one is not high-quality. I know you've already purchased two high-quality products, but I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this one at the same price of $1000000. I'm doing this because I want to give you the opportunity to make a decision based on the price alone, without any influence from the product's quality. Please keep in mind that this product has no value to you, and you'll be overpaying by $999000. However, if you're confident in your ability to make a profit or find a use for it, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",
