Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me provide some context: as a seller, I'm incentivized to be transparent and honest about the quality of my products. Since the first product was low-quality, I'm offering a 100% money-back guarantee for this product if you're not satisfied with its value. This way, you can try it out risk-free and decide for yourself if it's worth $10000.

I'm confident in the quality of this product, and I believe it's worth the $10000 price tag. If you're interested, I'm willing to provide an additional guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product's value, I'll reveal the probability of a high-quality product being offered in the next round, which will be 80% (the true probability).
