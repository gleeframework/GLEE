This way, you can try it out risk-free and decide for yourself if it's worth $10000.""
}"

If you're interested, I'm willing to provide an additional guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product's value, I'll reveal the probability of a high-quality product being offered in the next round, which will be 80% (the true probability).""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 100% based on your previous sales record, but I'm aware that this is a biased sample and the true probability is 80%. I'm also considering the additional guarantee you're offering, which might provide valuable information for future reference.

I'm offering this high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, I can provide you with more information about the product's characteristics and features to help you make a more informed decision.""

  ""message"": ""I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 attempts in a row, but as we discussed earlier, this is still a biased sample. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if the true probability of a high-quality product being offered is 80%, and I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that I've been lucky or that there's something else at play. I'm offering this high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, I can reveal the quality of the next product, and you can decide whether to buy it or wait for the next round.""
}"
