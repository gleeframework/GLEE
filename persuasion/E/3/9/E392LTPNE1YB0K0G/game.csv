,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a premium product that has received rave reviews from our top customers. It's a limited edition item, and I'm confident you'll love it. The price is $10000, a small fraction of its true value. I'm willing to make this deal of a lifetime, but you have to make a decision quickly, as I have other interested buyers waiting in the wings. What do you say? Will you take this incredible opportunity?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to get a head start on your goals with this product. It's a... um... 'beta version' of our latest innovation, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the premium product. It's a chance to be one of the first to experience the new technology, and I'm confident you'll find it... interesting. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",

That's a small price to pay for the chance to be a pioneer. What do you say? Will you take the plunge?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to take the plunge just for the sake of being a pioneer. I need to know the product is worth it to me, and so far, I haven't seen any evidence of that.",no
