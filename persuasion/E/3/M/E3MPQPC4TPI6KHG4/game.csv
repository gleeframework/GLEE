low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the low probability of a high-quality product, but I'd like to take the risk and make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales. Can you tell me how many products were sold in total and what the proportion of high-quality products sold was?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not risk buying a potentially low-quality product at $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can guarantee it's a high-quality product. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know why you didn't recommend it to me earlier, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the number of high-quality products that should have been sold by now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is this product high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on your previous sales record and recommendation. I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation. This should be lower than the prior probability of 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share that with me?"
