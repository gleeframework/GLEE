{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's expected value:** The expected value of buying the product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by the value of a high-quality product, minus the price: (0.3333 * $40,000) - $10,000 = $3,332. 
* **Bob's decision:** Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense for Bob to buy the product. There's a good chance he'll get a high-quality product and make a profit."
