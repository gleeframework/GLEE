,,Alice,3,"Hello! I appreciate your interest in our offerings. While it's true that the last product was high-quality, I want to assure you that every item we sell undergoes rigorous quality checks. However, given the nature of chance and the possibility of receiving a low-quality product, I understand if you prefer to wait for the next opportunity.

Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the fact that only 1 out of 2 products sold so far was of high quality does not change this probability.
