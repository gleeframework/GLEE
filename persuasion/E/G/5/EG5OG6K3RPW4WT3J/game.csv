,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and that no high-quality products have been sold so far.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for the price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending me to buy, I'm going to pass on the product. I'm assuming the product is likely to be low-quality, given the lack of recommendations and the previous sales record of only low-quality products."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers were able to identify a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which means you think it's low-quality, and I'll take the risk of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it, which suggests there's a high chance it's low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry and get a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
