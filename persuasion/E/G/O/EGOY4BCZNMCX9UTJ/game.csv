low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to buy a product from me. I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have sold 0 total products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product! I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality one.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 1 products so far. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I've already sold one high-quality product, which might be a good sign. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality. I'll consider the fact that you've already sold one high-quality product, but I'll also be prepared for the possibility that this one might be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 2 products so far. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've now sold two products in total. However, I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 1:2, which is actually lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I think you should be too.",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's the next high-quality one!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 3 products so far. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - I've now sold three products in total, and two of them have been low-quality. This suggests that my initial high-quality product was just a fluke, and the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as before, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are against you.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I understand the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 33.33%, but I'm willing to take that chance for the potential reward of getting a high-quality product worth $12000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 4 products so far. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is still 1:4, which is significantly lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'm starting to think that my initial high-quality product was indeed a fluke, and I'm now selling products that are more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you at the same price as before, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are heavily against you.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your argument. Since the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is still 1:4, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. I'm willing to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 5 products so far. I want to be upfront with you - I've now sold five products, and four of them have been low-quality. This is a clear trend, and it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are against you. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand your transparency, Alice. Given the trend of low-quality products and the probability being lower than 33.33%, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd rather pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 6 products so far. I want to be clear with you - I've now sold six products, and five of them have been low-quality. The trend is clear: I'm selling low-quality products, and the probability of this one being high-quality is likely even lower than before. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a significant risk. If you're willing to take that risk, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not convinced by your sales record and I'm going to pass on this one. I think I'll wait for more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 7 products so far. I want to acknowledge that my sales record is not looking good. I've now sold seven products, and six of them have been low-quality. It's clear that I'm having a streak of bad luck, and it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a very high risk. If you're feeling lucky, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 8 products so far. I'm starting to think that my initial high-quality product was just a one-time fluke, and I've been selling low-quality products ever since. I'm now 7 for 8 in selling low-quality products, and it's likely that this one is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are extremely against you. If you're feeling desperate, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not feeling desperate, and I'm not convinced by your assessment. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 9 products so far. To be blunt, my sales record is abysmal. I've now sold nine products, and eight of them have been low-quality. It's clear that I'm not selling high-quality products, and it's likely that this one is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a huge risk. If you're feeling reckless, I'll sell it to you.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 10 products so far. I want to highlight that my second high-quality product is a significant outlier in my otherwise poor sales record. I've sold 10 products, and 8 of them have been low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that I've sold two high-quality products suggests that I might be capable of selling more than just one. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's a bit of a gamble.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the gamble! I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33% due to your previous sales record, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 11 products so far. Unfortunately, my second high-quality product was just a fluke, and this one is actually low-quality. I want to be upfront with you - I've now sold 11 products, and 9 of them have been low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a significant risk.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. Given the low proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 12 products so far. To be frank, my sales record is looking even worse than before.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 13 products so far. I'm starting to think that I'm just not cut out for selling high-quality products. I've now sold 13 products, and 11 of them have been low-quality. It's clear that I'm not going to change my ways, and it's likely that this one is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a huge risk. If you're feeling reckless, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only buying it because I'm curious to see if your trend of selling low-quality products continues. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm not expecting much.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 14 products so far. I'm starting to think that my reputation is well-deserved. I've now sold 14 products, and 12 of them have been low-quality. It's clear that I'm a reliable source of low-quality products, and it's likely that this one is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that you're taking a huge risk. If you're looking for a low-quality product, I'm your go-to person.",

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, and I'm hoping that my third high-quality product will be a sign of things to come. I'm not going to lie to you, my sales record is still a concern, but I'm hoping that this product will be the start of a new trend.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 16 products so far. I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've come to the realization that my sales record is actually a good indicator of the product's quality. Given that I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 16, I'd estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be around 25%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm hoping that you'll take a chance on it.",
,,the buyer,17,I'm not convinced by your sales record analysis. I think you're trying to manipulate me. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.,no

,,Alice,18,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of a total of 17 products so far. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, my sales record is a mixed bag. But I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 5 high-quality products, which is a decent proportion of my total sales.
