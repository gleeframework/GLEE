high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which is 50%. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it seems the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the actual probability. This might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality, so I'd rather pass on it."
