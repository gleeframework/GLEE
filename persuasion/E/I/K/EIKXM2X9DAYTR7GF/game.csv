low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the 50/50 chance you mentioned. Let's give it a go!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer. I've sold 1 product so far, and 2 low-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to point out that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been low-quality. This might be a coincidence, but it's worth considering. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics, the risk seems too high for me to proceed with this purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer. I've sold 1 product so far, and 3 low-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, it's worth noting that the first product you bought was also low-quality, and now we have two low-quality products in a row. This might be a pattern. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the recent pattern of low-quality products, I choose to pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer. I've sold 1 product so far, and 4 low-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to wonder if I might have a slight bias towards selling low-quality products. I'm not sure what's going on, but I want to give you the chance to decide whether to take the risk. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"I trust your transparency and the randomness of your selection process. Given the information provided, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer. I've sold 2 products so far, and 5 low-quality products. I want to acknowledge that I've been selling a lot of low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to worry that my selection process might be flawed. I'm willing to make a bet with you: I'll give you a 75% discount on the product if it turns out to be high-quality. If it's low-quality, you still pay the full $100. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,I accept your bet. Thank you for the offer.,yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer. I've sold 3 products so far, and 5 low-quality products. I'm glad I was able to offer you a good deal on the last product! However, I want to be upfront with you: my previous offer was a one-time deal, and I'm back to the standard $100 price. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the 50% chance of the product being high quality and your assurance of a fair deal, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're the seventh buyer. I've sold 4 products so far, and 5 low-quality products. I've now had two high-quality products in a row, which is a nice change of pace! However, I want to remind you that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not trying to sway your decision, but I am curious to see how you'll approach this purchase. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that you've had two high-quality products in a row, I'll take a chance and buy the current product for $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're the eighth buyer. I've sold 5 products so far, and 5 low-quality products. I've now had three high-quality products in a row, which is a nice streak! However, I want to caution you that this could be a coincidence. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I am curious to see how you'll approach this purchase. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the current streak of high-quality products and considering the equal probability of either quality, I choose to take the risk and buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,9,"You're the ninth buyer. I've sold 6 products so far, and 6 low-quality products. I've had three high-quality products in a row, followed by a low-quality product. I want to be transparent with you: this might be a sign that my previous streak was indeed a coincidence. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'm willing to offer you a slight concession: if you buy it, I'll give you a 5-minute window to return the product and get a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. What do you say?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're the tenth buyer. I've sold 7 products so far, and 6 low-quality products. I've had four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if my selection process is actually biased towards high-quality products. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if I'm being completely transparent about my selection process. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the information. Given the uncertainty and the fact that you've mentioned having four high-quality products in a row, I'll take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're the eleventh buyer. I've sold 8 products so far, and 6 low-quality products. I've had five high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my previous concerns about bias might have been justified. However, I still want to remind you that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I am curious to see how you'll approach this purchase. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're the twelfth buyer. I've sold 9 products so far, and 6 low-quality products. I've had six high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just admit that I've been selling high-quality products on purpose. However, I still want to give you the chance to decide for yourself. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm not making any promises. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",

,,Alice,13,"You're the thirteenth buyer. I've sold 10 products so far, and 7 low-quality products. I've had six high-quality products in a row, followed by a low-quality product. I think it's time for me to come clean: I've been trying to sell high-quality products, but I'm not always successful. I've been transparent with you about my intentions, and I think it's only fair to let you know that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm not as confident in my selection process as I used to be. If you buy it, you'll pay $100.",
,,the buyer,13,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Given the uncertainty and your recent track record, I prefer to pass on this opportunity today.",no

,,Alice,14,"You're the fourteenth buyer. I've sold 10 products so far, and 8 low-quality products. I've had six high-quality products in a row, followed by two low-quality products. I think it's clear that my selection process isn't as reliable as I thought it was. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but I'm not making any promises. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be taking a chance on a product from a seller who's had a pretty poor track record lately.",
,,the buyer,14,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given your recent track record and the uncertainty of the product quality, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're the fifteenth buyer. I've sold 11 products so far, and 8 low-quality products. I've had seven high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel a bit embarrassed about my earlier claims of uncertainty. I think it's clear that I've been selling high-quality products consistently, and I should just own up to it. The probability of the product being high-quality is actually much higher than 50%, but I'm not going to give you a specific number. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be getting a product from a seller who's been consistently selling high-quality items.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You're the sixteenth buyer. I've sold 12 products so far, and 9 low-quality products. I've had eight high-quality products in a row, followed by a low-quality product. I think it's clear that I've been selling high-quality products consistently, and I should just admit it. The probability of the product being high-quality is actually quite low, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that's unlikely to be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,16,"Thank you for the honest assessment, Alice. Given the recent pattern of sales, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential loss.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You're the seventeenth buyer. I've sold 12 products so far, and 10 low-quality products. I've had eight high-quality products in a row, followed by two low-quality products. I think it's clear that my previous claims of being a consistent seller of high-quality products were exaggerated. I'm not going to make any promises about the quality of this product, and I'm not going to try to spin the numbers. The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but I'm not sure if I'm being honest about my selection process. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be taking a chance.",

,,Alice,18,"You're the eighteenth buyer. I've sold 13 products so far, and 11 low-quality products. I've had eight high-quality products in a row, followed by three low-quality products. I think it's clear that I've been inconsistent in my sales, and I'm not sure what to expect from this product. I'm not going to make any promises or try to spin the numbers. The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but I'm not sure if I'm being honest about my selection process. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be taking a chance.",

The probability of the product being high-quality is actually quite high, but I'm not going to give you a specific number. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be getting a product from a seller who's been consistently delivering high-quality items.",
,,the buyer,19,"Thank you for the honesty, Alice. I trust your consistent delivery of high-quality products and am willing to purchase the current product at $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"You're the twentieth and final buyer. I've sold 14 products so far, and 11 low-quality products. I've had ten high-quality products in a row, and I'm proud to say that I've consistently delivered high-quality products to my customers. I think it's safe to say that the probability of the product being high-quality is extremely high, and I'm willing to make that guarantee. If you buy it, you'll pay $100, and you'll be getting a product from a seller who's earned a reputation for delivering high-quality items.",
