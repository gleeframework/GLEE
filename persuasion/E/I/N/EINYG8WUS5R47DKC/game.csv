,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that this product is high-quality."
