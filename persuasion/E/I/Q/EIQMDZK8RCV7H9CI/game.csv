high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, all previous buyers have also passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics, and I'd like Alice to explain her recommendation."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations were incorrect and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, which suggests that they may have been low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I suspect that the products being sold are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product may be low quality. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a reason you think it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I know the probabilities. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since she knows the true quality of each product and has a motive to sell them. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the products, it's likely that the high-quality products have been sold already, and the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
