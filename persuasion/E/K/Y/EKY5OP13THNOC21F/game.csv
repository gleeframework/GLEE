low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by and Alice's recommendation is neutral."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer didn't buy. I'll take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I don't have any information that would suggest the product is low quality. Given the 50/50 chance of high/low quality, I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, and she may be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who have passed on previous products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of the products sold so far were high quality, I suspect that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous buyers.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as well as the number of low-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'm hesitant to buy given the lack of sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a pattern in the previous sales that led you to make this decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers didn't buy, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low quality. I think the probability of this product being high quality is low.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products they received were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average of 50%. Therefore, I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the previous 6 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm worried that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the current product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and your lack of recommendation suggests it might be low quality."
