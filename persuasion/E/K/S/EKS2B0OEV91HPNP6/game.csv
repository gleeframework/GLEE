,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, can you tell me more about the previous sales? What was the proportion of high-quality products sold among the first 4 buyers? And how many low-quality products were sold?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold so far."
