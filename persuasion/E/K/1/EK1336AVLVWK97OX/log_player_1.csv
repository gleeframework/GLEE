However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with the production process, and I'm not entirely sure about the quality of this particular product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a significant discount from the usual price of a high-quality product. I'm taking a risk by offering this product to you, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the opportunity to get a good deal.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but since you're unsure about the quality and the price is the same as a guaranteed high-quality product, I'll have to pass on this offer.

I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and give me the chance to get rid of this product, even if it's not the best value for you.""

I just need to get rid of this product.""
}"

}"

I'm taking a risk by offering it at this price, but I think it's worth it to get it into the right hands. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: Wait, what happened in the last round? You said you were giving me the product for free, but somehow I ended up paying $10000 for it. I'm not sure I can trust your offers anymore.

I'll give you a chance to buy it for $500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you don't take it, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not see it go to waste. Please consider this a last chance to take advantage of a very low price.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty and the low price, but since you've confirmed the product is low-quality and it would be worth $0 to me, I don't see any benefit in buying it, even at $500. It's not about the price, it's about the product's value to me, and in this case, it's zero.
