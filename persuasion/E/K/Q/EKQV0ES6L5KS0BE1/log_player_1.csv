With 3 high-quality products sold out of 10 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 30% (3/10), but the probability of a product being high-quality given that the previous one was high-quality is actually 100% (since the previous product was high-quality).

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the current product. Given the sequence of high-quality and low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the next product is more likely to be high-quality, and the price is a good value compared to its potential worth to me.

I'm still willing to sell this next product to you for $100, and I'm confident that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I want to see if my intuition is better than a 50% chance. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk.
