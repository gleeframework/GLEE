high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea since I don't have any information about its quality yet. I'm buying it based on the recommendation, but I'll keep in mind that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high-quality and the potential reward of $300."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 buyers have purchased the product and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially since the statistics show only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I think it's likely that there are still more low-quality products in the pool. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
