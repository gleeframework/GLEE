,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if it's low quality, I'll be wasting my money, and if it's high quality, I'm not getting any information that suggests it's different from the previous two products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a great deal for me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will make a purchase, which might reveal more information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid the loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
