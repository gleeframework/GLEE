low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll give you a second product of the same quality. You can keep both or sell them for whatever price you think they're worth.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the option to get a second one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a high-quality product for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. Think about it carefully, as this is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially great price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the high-quality product, but I'm only paying $100 for it because I'm not sure if the guarantee is worth anything.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Now that you've bought a high-quality product, you've earned the guarantee. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $100. I want to make it clear that this product is not high-quality, and I'm not guaranteeing anything about the next product. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one you just bought.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the guarantee that the next product might be high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering you a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $80. You can still get the guaranteed high-quality product in the next round, and you'll be getting this one at a discount. It's a chance to get something for less than its 'face value'.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in paying even $80 for a product worth $0 to me.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're right, the last two low-quality products weren't worth it to you. But this one is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'll even throw in a third product of the same quality if you buy this one. You can keep all three or sell them for whatever price you think they're worth. It's a chance to get a good deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not falling for it. I know you're just trying to get me to buy a high-quality product at $100. I'll wait for the guaranteed high-quality product in the next round.,no

You can use this information to inform your decision about the next product, which is guaranteed to be high-quality.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm not paying $100 for it. I'll pay $100, but I'm only doing it because I want the information about the previous low-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"As promised, here's the report on the previous two low-quality products: they were both defective and not worth the price. Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product for $80.

If you buy this one, you'll have the report and the guaranteed high-quality product in the next round.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've earned the guaranteed high-quality product! I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I'll throw in a twist: I'll also give you the option to buy a second high-quality product from a separate inventory, at the same price of $100. This second product is not part of the original guarantee, but it's a genuine high-quality item that I'm willing to sell to you at the same price as the first one.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the guaranteed high-quality product, and I'll also buy the second high-quality product. But I'm only paying $100 for each of them because I think they're worth more than that to me.",yes

,,Alice,10,"Congratulations on getting two high-quality products! I'm glad you're satisfied with the deal. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, but with a twist: I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price. You can make me an offer on this product, and I'll consider it. If we agree on a price, you'll get the product at that price. If not, I'll keep the product and we'll move on to the next round.",

I'll be transparent with you. This product is not worth $100, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $20. It's a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at a very low price. You can use it as a bargaining chip or discard it altogether.",
