,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the low recommendation rate and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you don't recommend it?"

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4, which is lower than the expected 0.3333. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products increases."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be a reliable indicator of the product's quality."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'll pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high quality is lower than 33.33% because I've seen that only 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you share the statistics again after I pass? I'd like to see the updated numbers before making my next decision.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 4 products sold was high-quality, which is a lower proportion than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the remaining products may have a lower quality, making it less likely for me to get a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
