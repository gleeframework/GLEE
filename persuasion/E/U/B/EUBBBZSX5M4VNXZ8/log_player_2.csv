Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but let me assure you that this product is a rare gem. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a product that's worth $30000 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm still not convinced. Given the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd be throwing $10,000 away if I buy and it turns out to be worthless to me. I need more information or a better deal to take the risk.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not convinced. With three products, I'd be spending $30,000 on average, and I'd still have a 12.5% chance of getting all three products being low-quality, which would be a huge loss.
