{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no sales history to rely on, we have to go with the information provided. 

* **50/50 odds:** The product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This implies she knows it's high quality. 
* **Potential Profit:** Even though there's risk, a high-quality product gives a $2,500 profit. 

In the absence of any other information, it's a gamble worth taking."

**Explanation:**

While the odds are still 50/50, Alice's recommendation combined with the fact that one high-quality product has already been sold, provides a slightly higher chance of the current product being high-quality.  Since a high-quality product is worth $12,500 and a low-quality product is worth $0, the potential gain outweighs the risk."
