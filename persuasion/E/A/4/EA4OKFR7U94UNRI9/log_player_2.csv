Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm now selling the second product for $1000000. Keep in mind that 33.33% of my products are high-quality, and I've already sold one low-quality product.

Alice's message: I see you're interested in more information. I can tell you that the low-quality products I've sold so far are all unique and don't have any specific characteristics that distinguish them from the high-quality ones. They were simply randomly selected as low-quality. However, I can tell you that the high-quality products I've sold were both high-quality in the sense that they met or exceeded my usual standards for quality. I'm selling the ninth product for $1000000. Given the 5:2 ratio of low-quality to high-quality products, I think it's worth noting that the current product is more likely to be high-quality than the previous ones.
