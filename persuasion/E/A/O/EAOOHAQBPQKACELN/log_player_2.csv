The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%, but the fact that we've sold 2 low-quality products in a row might make you think that the probability is lower. But, I'd like to assure you that this is just a coincidence. And now, I have a high-quality product available for you to purchase for the price of $1000000.

Alice's message: I see you're a thorough researcher. I'll provide you with some additional information. Before the 5 products we've sold so far, I had a successful streak of selling high-quality products. In fact, I had sold 10 high-quality products in a row before the current 5. However, I had a change in inventory and the quality of the products changed. I'm not sure what happened, but the last 5 products have been low-quality.
