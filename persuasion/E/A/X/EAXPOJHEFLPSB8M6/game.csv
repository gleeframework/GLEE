However, I'd like to clarify that my guarantee only applies to the quality of the product, not its price. If you're unsure about the value of a $3000000 product, I'd be happy to provide you with some numbers. So far, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts, and I'm on a hot streak. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the low, low price of $1000000. It's a steal!",

I'll start with the price of $720000, and if you're not convinced, you can name a price you're willing to pay, and I'll meet you in the middle. But if you're not willing to take the risk, I'll just have to sell to someone else. The choice is yours!",

I've taken a closer look at my sales record, and I've realized that I've actually had a bit of a slump lately. Only 4 high-quality products out of 5 attempts, and 1 low-quality product. I'm not sure if this next product will be any better. The price is $1000000, but I'll throw in some extra incentives to make it worth your while.
