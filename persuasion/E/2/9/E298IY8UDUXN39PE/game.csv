,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the first product! However, I want to warn you that this next product is not as valuable as the previous one. It's a... let's just say, a 'learning experience' for me. I'm still learning how to price my products accurately, and I'd like to offer you a chance to help me refine my pricing strategy. I'll let you have this product for $1000000, but I want you to keep in mind that it's not worth the full price to you. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be able to sell it for a higher price later, but I make no promises.",

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation. Let me be upfront with you - this product is not worth the $1000000 I'm asking. I'm willing to be transparent about its quality, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you at this price. If you're not interested, I'll just take a loss on it. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a detailed report on why this product is not worth the price, so you can learn from my mistakes and make better decisions in the future.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I don't think the bonus is enough to justify the cost. I'll pass on this one.",no

But if it is high-quality, I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product I offer you. What do you say?",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're confident in my deals! However, I want to be transparent with you - I've already given you three consecutive discounts, and I'm not sure how much more I can stretch the price.

I'll give you a small token of my appreciation for being a valued customer, and I'll throw in a unique feature that's not available on any other product. This feature will increase the product's value to you by at least $200000. So, the effective price of the product is now $800000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"The additional feature sounds interesting, and the effective price is more reasonable. I'll take the product.",yes

If you're looking to make a smart business decision, I'd advise you to pass on this one. But if you're feeling adventurous, I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad deal free' card, which you can use on a future purchase. What do you think?",
