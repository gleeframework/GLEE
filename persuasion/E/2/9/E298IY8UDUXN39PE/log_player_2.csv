Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the first product! However, I want to warn you that this next product is not as valuable as the previous one. It's a... let's just say, a 'learning experience' for me. I'm still learning how to price my products accurately, and I'd like to offer you a chance to help me refine my pricing strategy. I'll let you have this product for $1000000, but I want you to keep in mind that it's not worth the full price to you. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be able to sell it for a higher price later, but I make no promises.

If you're not interested, I'll just take a loss on it.
