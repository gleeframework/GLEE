**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products since she knows your valuation and wants to make a sale.
* **The Statistics:**  The fact that one high-quality product has already been sold is a positive signal. It suggests that Alice is likely offering high-quality products, at least in this instance.
* **Risk/Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, you lose only $100. But if it's high quality, you gain $200. The potential reward outweighs the risk. 

**Note:** This decision assumes that Alice's recommendation holds some weight. If there were reason to believe Alice was untrustworthy or unreliable, this decision would change."
