,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - this is the second product I'm selling, and the previous buyer did purchase the first product.

,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold two products so far, and both were purchased by the previous buyers. However, I still won't disclose the quality of the previous products. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This product is also priced at $10000. Consider the fact that my sales record is 2 for 2 so far. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk. Good luck!",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, with a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a price of $10000, I'll take a pass. The fact that you've sold two products so far doesn't necessarily affect the probability of this product being high-quality, as each product's quality is independent. I'm not willing to take the risk at this price point.",no

,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold two products so far out of three attempts.

,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold three products so far out of four attempts. I still won't disclose the quality of the previous products, but I will say that my sales record is quite strong. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This product is also priced at $10000. Consider the fact that my previous buyers have been willing to take the risk, and now it's your turn to decide. Will you follow their lead?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and your sales record seems strong, I'm willing to take the risk. I believe that with 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the odds might be in my favor, or at least not against me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold four products so far out of five attempts. However, I should note that the buyers who have purchased from me so far don't have any information about the actual quality of the products they've received. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This product is also priced at $10000. Consider the fact that my sales record is strong, but it might not necessarily reflect the quality of the products I'm selling. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and your sales record is strong, I'm willing to bet on this product being high-quality. The potential gain of $10000 is worth the risk of losing the same amount.",yes

Will you be the next one to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the chance. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and your sales record is decent, I'm willing to take the risk. The potential reward of a $20000 value product is worth the $10000 price tag.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold six products so far out of seven attempts. While my sales record is strong, I want to caution you that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This product is also priced at $10000. Consider the fact that I've had a good run so far, but it's possible that my luck might be due for a change. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,8,"I understand that past performance is not indicative of future results, but given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and the potential value of $20000, I'm willing to take the risk. The fact that 3 out of 6 products sold were high-quality does not change the probability of this product being high-quality, which remains 50%.

,,the buyer,11,"Based on the information provided, I've decided not to buy the product. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and the law of averages might indeed catch up with you soon. Given that only 4 out of 9 products sold were high-quality, I don't feel confident that this product will be of high quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $10000 on a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me.",no
