"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). In the long run, buying every product will lead to a positive expected value."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice! I'm feeling confident about this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic from round 1 applies here. The expected value of buying is still positive, even though the price is high.  Alice's recommendation doesn't change the probability of a product being high or low quality, but it does provide some additional information that we can consider. Since she recommended buying, it might be slightly more likely to be a good product, but not enough to change our strategy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll with these recommendations! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern continues.  The potential reward for a high-quality product far outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality one.  We have no reason to deviate from our strategy of buying every product at this point."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Let's keep going, Alice. I trust your judgment!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though we lost money on the last round, the fundamental logic remains the same.  Each product has a 50/50 chance of being high quality, and the potential gain still outweighs the potential loss. Alice's recommendation doesn't affect the inherent probabilities of the products, so we should continue buying."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm going to keep trusting your recommendations, Alice. Let's see what this one holds!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game's rules haven't changed. Each product still has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, regardless of what happened in previous rounds. Alice's recommendations don't alter the inherent probabilities of the products. The potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) is still greater than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).  Therefore, buying every product remains the optimal strategy for maximizing potential profit in the long run."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still confident in your recommendations. Let's see what we get this time!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the last few rounds have not been profitable, the fundamental logic of the game remains unchanged.  Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality.  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) is still significantly greater than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). Therefore, it's still in my best interest to buy every product, as the long-term expected value of this strategy is positive."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're proving your recommendations are valuable! I'm buying this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite the streak of low-quality products, the core principle of the game hasn't changed.  The expected value of buying each product remains positive due to the potential for a high-quality product. Alice's recommendations, though not always accurate, are still a valuable piece of information. Since she's recommending a purchase, it might slightly increase the chance of a good product, but even without that, the risk-reward ratio is still heavily in favor of buying."

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality, and the potential gain ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0). Alice's recommendations don't change the inherent probability of each product, but they do provide additional information.

However, even without that extra information, buying every product is still the optimal strategy in the long run."
