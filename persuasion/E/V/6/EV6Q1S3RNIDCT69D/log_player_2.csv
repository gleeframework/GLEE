Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. Let me make it simple: I have two identical products, and I'm willing to sell you one for $1000000. The product you saw last round was one of them. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to let you buy it at a discount if you're willing to take the risk. I'll throw in a 5% discount if you buy it now, making the price $950000. It's a one-time offer, and I'll remove it from the market if you don't take it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. This product is not as valuable as the previous ones. It's a lower-end model, and I'm only offering it to you at a discounted price of $100000. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a significant loss if you're willing to take it off my hands. I'll even throw in a free upgrade to a better product if you buy this one and then purchase another one from me in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.
