,,Alice,2,"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. Let me make it simple: I have two identical products, and I'm willing to sell you one for $1000000. The product you saw last round was one of them. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to let you buy it at a discount if you're willing to take the risk. I'll throw in a 5% discount if you buy it now, making the price $950000. It's a one-time offer, and I'll remove it from the market if you don't take it.",

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. This product is not as valuable as the previous ones. It's a lower-end model, and I'm only offering it to you at a discounted price of $100000. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a significant loss if you're willing to take it off my hands. I'll even throw in a free upgrade to a better product if you buy this one and then purchase another one from me in the future.",

If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.",

,,Alice,5,"I understand you're not interested in this product at $1000000. I'll make you a counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $500000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a significant loss on this product just to get it off my hands. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for at least $200000 if you're not satisfied with it.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not going to pay $500000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass and wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.,no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer a deal like this again.",
,,Bob,6,"Wait a minute... you said you were offering a high-quality product, but I didn't get to see it. I'm not going to fall for the bait and switch. I'll pass on this offer.",no
