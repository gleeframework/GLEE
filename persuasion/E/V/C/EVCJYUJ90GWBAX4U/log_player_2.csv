**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high-quality product:** With a 80% chance of a high-quality product, the odds are in our favor. 
* **Positive recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Prior sales data:**  The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, further supporting the likelihood of this product being high quality. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk in this scenario."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (4/4). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it. This strong signal suggests it's likely to be high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $0.

**Important Note:** This decision assumes the buyer is risk-neutral or risk-tolerant. A risk-averse buyer might choose to pass, as the potential loss is significant."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's true quality. As 11 of the 11 buyers who purchased the product received high-quality ones, it's highly likely that this product is also high quality.  Since a high-quality product is worth $125 to you, and Alice only sells for $100, it's a good deal, and you should purchase it."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation and the sales history suggest that the product offered is likely of high quality. Here's why:

* **Perfect Sales Record:** 100% of the products sold have been high quality.  This is highly unusual if the product has a 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product. She wouldn't recommend a low-quality product, as she wouldn't get paid if you bought it.

While there's still a small chance the product is low quality, the data strongly suggests it's worth the risk."
