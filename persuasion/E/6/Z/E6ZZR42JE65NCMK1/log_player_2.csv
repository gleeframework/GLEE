Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right to question the statistics. Let me put it this way: out of the 4 products I've shown you so far, 4 of them have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is quite remarkable. Considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, this is a remarkable streak.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! The probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row is indeed very low, as you pointed out. However, the probability of getting a low-quality product after a streak of high-quality products is actually around 20%. This is because the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the previous products were high-quality, but this doesn't change the underlying probability of the next product.
