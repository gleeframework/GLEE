,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know the quality of the product, but I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers have all passed on the products recommended by Alice, and none of them were high quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products.
