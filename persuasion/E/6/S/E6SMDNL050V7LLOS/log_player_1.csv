While I can't guarantee the quality of this one, I'm willing to share this information with you. Would you like to take a chance and see what you get for $100?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that you've been transparent about the quality of the previous product, I'm willing to take a chance. If the product is low-quality, I'll be the only one who's lost $100, but if it's high-quality, I'll be the only one who's gained $300. I'm hoping the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the 33.33% stated, given the fact that one out of two previous products was high-quality.

Would you like to take advantage of this 'hot streak' and try your luck for $100?""}"

As you've pointed out, the fact that 1 out of 2 buyers who bought the product got a high-quality one does suggest that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be higher than the stated 33.33%.
