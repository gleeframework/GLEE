**Explanation:**

* **The previous buyer's purchase:**  Knowing that the previous buyer bought the product and it was high-quality gives us valuable information. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely to be accurate in this case.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($2,000,000).  Even though the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the previous buyer's success makes the gamble more appealing. 
* **Trust in Alice's judgment:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation carries weight. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available and the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith. In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider."
