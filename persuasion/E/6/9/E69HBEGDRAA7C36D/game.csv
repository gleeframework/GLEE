low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't affect my decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation, but I'll pass for now.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,I have recommended not buying for low-quality products and buying for high-quality products so far.
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. If I buy it, I'll lose $1000000 if it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,This is the third high-quality product in a row that I've recommended to buy. The probability of three consecutive high-quality products being recommended is 1/8 if I were randomly recommending. Consider this when making your decision.
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,This is the fourth high-quality product in a row that I've recommended to buy. I've consistently recommended buying for high-quality products and not buying for low-quality products. The probability of four consecutive high-quality products being recommended by chance is 1/16. I'm trying to convey that my recommendations are genuine. Consider this when making your decision.
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low sales record of high-quality products so far.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,I've consistently recommended buying for high-quality products and not buying for low-quality products. This product does not meet my standards for recommendation.
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.,
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"I've consistently recommended buying for high-quality products and not buying for low-quality products. This is the fifth high-quality product that I've recommended to buy. I'm starting to think that the buyers are making a mistake by not trusting my recommendations. If you trust me, you'll make a $1000000 profit. Consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all products recommended by you have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from someone else, hoping they might have a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I understand that the statistics so far may be misleading, but I assure you that I've been recommending high-quality products genuinely. This is the sixth high-quality product that I've recommended to buy. I'm willing to stake my reputation on this recommendation. If you don't buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll miss out on a $1000000 profit. Please consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and neither of them purchased, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to them were low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I see a pattern here. None of the buyers are trusting my recommendations, and it's leading to a loss for both of us. I want to break this cycle. I'll give you all the information I can. Out of the 13 previous rounds, 7 products were high-quality, and I recommended buying for all of them. The other 6 were low-quality, and I recommended not buying them. You can verify this after you buy the product. I'm putting my credibility on the line here. Please consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is likely a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I'm starting to think that the buyers are making a mistake by assuming that my previous recommendations were low-quality. I want to correct this misconception. The 2 previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy did not buy the product, so you can't conclude that the products were low-quality. In fact, I've been recommending high-quality products consistently. This is the 8th high-quality product that I've recommended to buy. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to verify this. Please consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record. With 2 buyers and 2 products sold, and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Can I get the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"I see what's happening here. The buyers are making a mistake by assuming that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 0. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet doesn't mean that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 0. The probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%, as stated initially. I've been recommending high-quality products consistently, but the buyers haven't been buying them. This product, however, is low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the previous sales record?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"No, my recommendation is not based on the previous sales record. I have direct knowledge of the product's quality, and I can tell you that this product is low-quality. I've been recommending high-quality products consistently, but this one does not meet my standards. Please don't buy it."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"As I mentioned earlier, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%, as stated initially. However, I have direct knowledge of this product's quality, and I can tell you that it is low-quality. I strongly advise against buying it."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I understand that you might be skeptical, but I assure you that my recommendation is genuine. This product is low-quality, and buying it would be a loss for you. I've been consistent in my recommendations, and I'm trying to help you make an informed decision. Please don't buy this product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"This is the last round, and I want to be honest with you. I've been recommending high-quality products consistently, but this product is low-quality. I don't want you to lose $1000000. Please don't buy this product. If you want, I can reveal the results of all the previous rounds to prove my honesty."
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics.",
