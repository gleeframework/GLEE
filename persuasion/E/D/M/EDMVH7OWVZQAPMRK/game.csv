,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I think this is a contrarian play based on the fact that you have no reason to recommend it and 5 previous buyers didn't take the bait. I'm hoping that the low-quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% and the product is low-quality."
