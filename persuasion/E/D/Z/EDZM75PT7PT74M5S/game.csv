,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'd like to wait for the next round to see if Alice's recommendation improves.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"I've recommended two high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. Don't get too excited."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,

,,Bob,6,no,I'm not going to fall for it again. Alice's recommendation is probably a trap.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,

,,Bob,7,yes,I'm taking another chance on Alice's recommendation. Maybe she's trying to make up for the last mistake.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"You're on a roll, Bob! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you're taking a chance on me. This one's a good one too - it's high-quality, and it's worth $40000 to you. Keep the streak going!"
,,Bob,8,yes,Alice's streak is impressive! I'll take another chance and hope it continues.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"Sorry, Bob, I think I've got one wrong. Don't get too attached to the streak - I'm only human (or at least, a seller trying to make a sale). This one's a low-quality product, and it's not worth your money."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I know you're skeptical, Bob, and I don't blame you. But think about it - if you pass up this high-quality product, you'll be leaving $40000 on the table. I'm not asking you to take a risk on a low-quality product, I'm offering you a proven high-quality product that's worth a lot of money. It's a no-brainer."
,,Bob,11,yes,I'm taking another chance on Alice's recommendation. Maybe she's trying to make up for her previous mistake.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I told you, Bob, I'm not always going to recommend high-quality products. I'm a seller, not a guarantee. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it. You've already taken a chance on me once, and it didn't pay off. Don't make the same mistake again."
,,Bob,12,no,Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indication that the product is low-quality. I'll pass this time.
