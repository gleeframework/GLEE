,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I'm glad you're interested in my product. As you know, I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm happy to share with you the quality of that product. Unfortunately, it was a low-quality product, which means I'm still at 0 high-quality products sold. However, I'm excited to tell you that this next product is indeed high-quality! I'm offering it to you at the price of $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth round! I'm thrilled to report that the previous buyer was able to purchase a high-quality product from me, which brings my total high-quality sales to 1! I'm now at 2 products sold in total, with 1 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've just given you a chance to observe two instances, one of which was high-quality. I'm offering this next product to you at the price of $1000000. Given the updated information, what do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the current product. Based on the updated statistics, I estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be around 33.33%, which is the same as the initial probability. However, I'm willing to take the risk since I've seen one high-quality product out of two sold so far, which suggests that the probability might be slightly higher than the initial estimate. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit.",yes
