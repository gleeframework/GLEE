I've sold 1 high-quality product to the buyer in Round 1.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the chance! As for why I think I'm due for another high-quality product, I'll share some insights with you. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the law of large numbers suggests that as I sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products should converge to this probability. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 9 total products offered, I'm hoping that the next one will be high-quality. That being said, the probability is still against you, and I'm offering this one for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?
