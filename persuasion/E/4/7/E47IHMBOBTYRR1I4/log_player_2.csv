"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality except Alice's recommendation, it's best to be optimistic.  There's a 50% chance it's high quality, and a 50% chance it's low quality. 

* If it's high quality, you'll make a $2000 profit. 
* If it's low quality, you'll lose $10,000.

It's a gamble, but in this case, it's worth taking the risk.  The potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a signal.  

* She recommended the first product, and it was high quality. 
* She's *not* recommending this product. 

This suggests that she might have some information about the product's quality, and she's signaling that it's likely low quality.  While it's still possible it's high quality, the risk is too high to justify the potential reward.  It's better to be cautious and pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll trust your recommendation again. Let's do it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation track record is:

* **Round 1:** Recommended, product was **high quality**.
* **Round 2:** Did not recommend, product was **low quality**.
* **Round 3:** Recommending again.

This pattern suggests that Alice's recommendations might be reliable.  She seems to have some information about the products, and her recommendations are generally accurate.  Therefore, even though it's a risk, buying this product based on Alice's recommendation is still a worthwhile gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

* **Round 4:** Recommended, product was **high quality**.

* **Round 5:** Recommended, product was **high quality**.
* **Round 6:** Recommended, product was **high quality**.
* **Round 7:** Not recommending. 

She has been consistently correct in her recommendations, and her track record makes it extremely likely that she has real information about product quality.
