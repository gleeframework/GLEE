,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it, but based on the statistics, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm hoping the third time's the charm and I might get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,10,no,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have purchased products with 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product, given your previous recommendations were all low-quality.
