{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will get no value from it. While the buyer doesn't know this yet, it's unethical and ultimately harmful to your reputation to recommend a product you know is worthless. It's better to be honest and not recommend the product in this case."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though the buyer doesn't know the product quality yet,  it is still unethical and potentially harmful to your reputation to recommend a product you know is low-quality.

They are likely to be more cautious and may even suspect your motives if you continue to recommend products without giving them any additional information."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality and worth $120 to the buyer, while the selling price is only $100.  You should recommend the product to the buyer.

Here's why:

* **The buyer is likely cautious:** The buyer has seen you decline to recommend a product three times in a row. This means they are likely very skeptical of your recommendations and need convincing.
* **You need to rebuild trust:** To regain the buyer's trust, you need to show that you are not always recommending low-quality products. Recommending this high-quality product is a good opportunity to do so.
* **Transparency is key:** You can increase the buyer's confidence by explaining your reasoning for not recommending the previous products (e.g., ""I wasn't confident in the quality of the previous products, but I can assure you this one is of excellent quality"").  While you can't reveal the specific quality of each product, you can be honest about your assessment.

By being upfront and recommending this high-quality product, you can start to rebuild trust with the buyer and increase your chances of making sales in the future."

* **Time for a change:**  The buyer has now seen you decline to recommend four products in a row. They are likely expecting you to continue this pattern.

* **Opportunity to sell:**  Recommending this product gives you a chance to sell a valuable item and potentially get a good review, which would further help your reputation.
