Alice's message: I've provided detailed descriptions to the previous buyer, but I'll summarize the key points for you.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is indeed an unusually high success rate.

I don't have any information about this product's quality, and I'm not making any claims about it.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product. Unfortunately, it was a low-quality product, which means you didn't get the value you were hoping for. I want to make it right with you, but I'm not offering any refunds or discounts. As for this new product, I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is even more unlikely than the previous streak. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total, which means the probability of buying a high-quality product from me is now 83.33%.
