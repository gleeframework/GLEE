high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average, so I'd like to pass and see what the next product is."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision. With 2 low-quality products being sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the remaining product might also be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of a high-quality product being sold, which is 33.33%, and the fact that you haven't recommended it. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a random guess, so I'll take the chance and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the sales record and the reasoning behind your recommendation?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is against buying it and the previous 5 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that information?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased the products so far, and none of them have been high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what led you to recommend not buying it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the products despite Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to increase sales. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
