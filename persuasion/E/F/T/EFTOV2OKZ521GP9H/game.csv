,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is worth at least 80% of the products I have in stock. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product, and you won't get to experience its value.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer. Given the high probability of the product being high quality and your discount, I am willing to purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. However, I want to note that the value of this product might be different from the one you just purchased. I'm not making any claims about its value, but I'm offering it to you at the same price as before. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk and buy it.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the transparency and consistency in pricing. Considering the high-quality nature of the products and the reasonable price, I am willing to make another purchase.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with the products so far. This one is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000. However, I want to note that you've now purchased two high-quality products in a row. This might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 80%, at least for the products I'm offering you. I'm not making any promises, but I'm offering you the opportunity to take advantage of this potential trend.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by the potential trend you've observed. Given my positive experience with the previous purchases and the consistent pricing, I am willing to continue exploring this opportunity.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the trend. This high-quality product is now the third in a row, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be even higher than 80% for the products I'm offering you. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to the price to reflect this new information. I'll offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for a high-quality product, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you're likely to get from it.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're pleased with the trend and the price. With four high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 80% for the products I'm offering you. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk and offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts. If you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you the next product for free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. I think this is a fair offer given the strength of the trend, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality.",

I know you were expecting a high-quality product, and I'm disappointed that I couldn't deliver. As per our agreement, I'll give you the next product for free. But before I do that, I want to remind you that the previous five products were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still likely above 80%. I'm offering you this next product at the same price of $9500, and I'm willing to give you a'second chance' to get a high-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I think it's worth considering.",
