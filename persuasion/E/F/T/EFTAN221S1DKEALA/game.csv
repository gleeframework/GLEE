low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping that the product is low-quality, which would be a good opportunity for me to buy at a discount. However, I'm also aware that there's a 33.33% chance that the product is high-quality, and I'd be making a great deal if that's the case."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. Alice's recommendation also doesn't give me confidence in purchasing it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations might be based on the product's quality. Since you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you're not recommending it.
