Alice's message: I determined the probability of a product being high-quality by updating it based on the number of high-quality and low-quality products sold so far. Since 6 out of 7 products were low-quality, and the initial probability of a product being high-quality was 33.33%, the updated probability is indeed 12.5% (1/8). With 8 products sold, I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 7 low-quality products. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 11.11% (1/9). I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Would you like to take the risk?

Since the probability of it being high-quality is 18.18%, the expected value is 0.1818 * 120 + 0.8182 * 0 = $21.82.
