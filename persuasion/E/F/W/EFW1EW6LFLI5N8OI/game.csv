,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product, and given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous products were low-quality."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm not confident in the product's quality. I'll pass on it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,I recommended against buying the product because the pattern of low-quality products sold and the lack of high-quality products sold suggests that this product is likely low-quality as well.
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, this is actually lower than expected. I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I understand your updated probability assessment, but unfortunately, this product is still low-quality."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the products after your recommendation, and none of the products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that your recommendations are based on the product's quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd rather pass and see if the next product is any better."
