,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! We're glad to share that our sales record shows that 33.33% of our products are high-quality. Since we're just starting out, this is our first sale, so we don't have any specific data on this particular product yet. However, we're confident in the quality of our products and would like to offer you this one for $10000. Would you like to take a chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance and make a purchase.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our store! We're glad to have you consider our product. As you know, we've had two sales so far, and one of them was high-quality.

Considering this, we're offering you this product for $10000. We're confident that our products are worth the investment, but we also understand that there's an element of risk. Would you like to take a chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. Given that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the previous buyers were either very lucky or the sales record is not representative. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk.",no

Would you like to take a chance and make a purchase?",
