This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that high-quality products are worth $12,500 to him, it's clearly beneficial for Bob to buy the product at the price of $10,000. He will make a profit of $2,500."

Since the low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, and he's risk-averse (as evidenced by his decision to pass in the first round), it's not advisable for him to buy.
