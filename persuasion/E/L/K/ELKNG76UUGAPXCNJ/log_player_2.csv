Round 2
Alice's message: I've got a great deal for you! This product is a rare opportunity to get a product that's worth $0 to you, but I'm selling it to you for $10000. It's a unique chance to own a product that's essentially free, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal.

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee: if the next product I offer is also high-quality, I'll sell it to you for $8000, just like the last one. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for a total of $16000, instead of $20000 each. What do you say?
