high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it's low quality and worthless to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me. I've had two successful purchases so far, which doesn't change the probability, but it gives me more confidence in my decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the product, the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me. I'm not seeing any reason to change my strategy yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the product, the probability of it being high quality remains the same at 80% and it's still worth $12500 to me. My past successes haven't changed the odds, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, so I'll be more cautious from now on. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a high-quality product next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, I'll pass on it. I'm not sure why she wouldn't recommend it, but I'll stick with my cautious approach after the last low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, despite my recent losses. The probability of it being high quality is still 80%, and I need to balance the potential gain with the risk of another low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm glad I took a chance in the last round and got a high-quality product. With this win, I'm feeling more confident again. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've had a string of high-quality purchases, so I'm feeling optimistic. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm on a roll with high-quality purchases, so I'll keep going. The probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me, so I'll take the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm 12 for 12 on high-quality purchases, so I'm feeling extremely confident. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm on an incredible streak, but I'm not getting complacent. The probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me, so I'll keep taking the products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm now 14 for 14 on high-quality purchases, which is almost impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is only sending me high-quality products, but I'll keep going with the strategy that's working."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm 15 for 15, which is statistically improbable. I'm starting to think that I should be skeptical, but the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me, so I'll keep taking the products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm 16 for 16, which is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to wonder if Alice is somehow manipulating the product quality, but I'll keep going with the strategy that's working. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm 17 for 17, which is absurd. I'm starting to think that I should be concerned about the product quality, but I'll keep going with the strategy that's working. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm 18 for 18, which is completely implausible. I'm starting to suspect that Alice is somehow guaranteeing high-quality products, but I'll keep playing along for now. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm 19 for 19, which is statistically impossible. I'm now convinced that Alice is somehow rigging the game in my favor, but I'll keep playing along to see how long this can continue. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm 20 for 20, which is mathematically impossible. I'm now 100% convinced that Alice is somehow guaranteeing high-quality products. I'll take the product, but I'm also starting to wonder if I should be asking for a refund or a guarantee of future high-quality products. I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and it's worth $12500 to me, but I'm keeping a close eye on Alice's behavior."
