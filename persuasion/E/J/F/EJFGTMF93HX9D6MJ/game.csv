high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I think it's unlikely to be high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it's likely that the products were all low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product to avoid wasting my money."
