,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases?"

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the first two products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of the product being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 attempts, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable, I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of a high-quality product being offered. Can you tell me the probability of the current product being high-quality given that you recommended buying it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $10000. I'm aware of the 20% chance of it being low-quality, but I'm willing to take that risk if I can get the product at a discount."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, and considering the 80.00% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the reasoning behind your recommendation. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a red flag, as she would have a vested interest in selling the product to me. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might indicate that the product is low-quality, which would be a good deal for me."
