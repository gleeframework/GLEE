"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Expected Value:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, worth $40,000.  This means the expected value of buying is 0.8 * $40,000 = $32,000.
* **Profit:**  Even though the product is being sold for $10,000, the buyer is likely to make a significant profit ($32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000) if the product is high-quality.
* **No information about past sales:**  Since this is the first round, there's no information about the seller's past performance. The buyer should rely on the known probability of a high-quality product.

**Therefore, it's a good decision for the buyer to purchase the product in this round.**"

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer now has information about the seller's past sales.** The seller sold one product in the previous round, and it was high-quality. This might lead the buyer to believe the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products.
* **However, the current product is low-quality.** Even if the seller is intentionally trying to sell more high-quality products, there's no way to guarantee that this specific product is high-quality. 
* **Negative Expected Value:** With an 80% chance of the product being low-quality and worth $0, the expected value is only 0.8 * $0 + 0.2 * $40,000 = $8,000.  This is less than the selling price of $10,000, meaning the buyer is likely to lose money if they buy.

**Therefore, it's not a good decision for the buyer to purchase the product in this round.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate you providing your expertise.  Given the low probability of this product being high quality, I'm going to pass on this one.

* **Positive Expected Value:** The buyer still knows there's an 80% chance this product is high-quality, worth $40,000. The expected value remains 0.8 * $40,000 = $32,000, which is significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000.
