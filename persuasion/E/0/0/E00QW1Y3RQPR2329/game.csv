,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the low sales of high-quality products so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if you would recommend the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a sign that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless item."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to the low quality of the products offered, not the buyers' decisions."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the price, but if it's low-quality, I'll be disappointed. I'm making a gamble based on the fact that Alice has recommended 6 low-quality products so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 7 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will assume that the probability of a product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I will update my probability of the product being high quality to 1/8, since I'm the 8th buyer. However, this is a very low probability, and I will pass on the product."
