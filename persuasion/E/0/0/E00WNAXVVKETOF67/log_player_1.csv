I'm willing to give you a chance to take it home and enjoy its value.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although your sales record is somewhat promising, a 45.5% success rate is still less than the initial 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Given that the product's value to me is either $1250000 or $0, I don't think the odds are in my favor to pay $1000000. I'll have to pass on this one.

I'll also remind you that I've had a 5 out of 12 success rate, which is getting closer to the 50% mark. Maybe this product will be the one that breaks the streak.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the sales record, but given the current information, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%.

I'll also give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before purchasing it, just like the previous buyer had. This way, you can make an informed decision about its quality.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the opportunity to inspect the product, I must consider the overall statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, and your own records showing 6 high-quality products out of 13, the probability of this product being high-quality is still uncertain.

This way, you have nothing to lose.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've offered a refund, I still have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I would still lose $1000000 if I get a low-quality product, and the refund would be worth $0. I'll pass on this opportunity.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'd like to point out that the statistics you provided earlier don't seem to match the current situation. You mentioned 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which is different from your claim of 8 high-quality products out of 15 sold.
