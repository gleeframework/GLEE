,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record. With 2 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like a low-quality product is more likely. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the seller's mistake."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can do better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I will also pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, and based on the previous sales record, I'm seeing a pattern of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait and see if Alice will reveal more information about the product before making a decision."
