high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product and I don't have any information about previous sales, so I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that I'm the first buyer. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and see what I get."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might be a sign that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'd like to pass on this one. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information on the product's quality and Alice's previous recommendation doesn't change my uncertainty. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high quality and the potential reward, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 20%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous buyers have not purchased any high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 80.00% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'll get is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that you recommended it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I'm not sure what's going on with the previous sales, but I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice has recommended it to 3 previous buyers, and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80.00%, and I'd like to avoid the potential loss of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite your recommendation, I suspect that the products they bought were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend, or for more information about the products before making a decision."
