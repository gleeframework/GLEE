high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for your interest in this product. I'd be happy to provide you with some context. As you may know, I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in this product. I'd like to point out that you've just seen two products, and one of them was high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. In fact, given the first product was low-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 80%, which is the same as the overall probability of any product being high-quality. Would you like to take it home today for $10000?",

With 4 sales in total, and 4 high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 100%. However, I'd like to point out that this is an unusually high success rate, and it's possible that I've been selling a streak of high-quality products. Nevertheless, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. Would you like to take it home today for $10000?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the unusually high success rate, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that this streak continues!",yes

I'm willing to sell you this product for $10000, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on your next purchase if you buy this one. Would you like to take it home today?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate the additional context, Alice. I understand the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%.
