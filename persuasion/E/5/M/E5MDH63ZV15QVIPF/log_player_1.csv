If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal, as it's worth at least 50% more than the asking price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product of this quality anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart investment?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000 when I know its actual value is $20000. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can then buy at the same price and still make a profit.

This way, you'll still be getting a great deal, and I'll be able to move this product quickly. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'm not willing to pay more than $10000 for it. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! However, I'm not willing to budge on the price. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll give you a 'honesty bonus' of $500, which I'll add to the price, making it $9,500. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a price that's even closer to its true value. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the 'honesty bonus', but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9500. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'd be leaving money on the table. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price, Bob. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy a high-quality product at $10,000 if you had a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product instead, and a 50% chance of getting the high-quality product you know and love? I'll give you that option, and you can make your decision based on the odds.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'd be leaving money on the table. The 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product doesn't change my decision, as I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.
Bob didn't bought the product.

You'll be getting a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart buy?""
}"
"Bob's message: Finally! I'm glad I waited. I'll take the low-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'm willing to pay the price to get it out of the way and avoid wasting another $10000 on a high-quality product.

I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll give you a 'volume discount' of $1,000, making the price $9,000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at an even better price. Plus, I'll throw in a free inspection report, so you can verify the product's quality before making a decision. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, especially not at $9000. I'm happy to have gotten the low-quality product out of the way, and I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another low-quality product at the same price.

If you buy the lot, I'll give you a significant discount, making the price per product $8,000. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, and I'm not interested in buying a lot of products either. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.

This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're a master of this game, Bob! Alright, let's try something different. I'll give you a 'certification' for this high-quality product, which will guarantee its authenticity and value. This certification is usually worth $2,000, but I'll give it to you for free if you buy the product. You'll still be getting a high-quality product at the price of $10,000, but with the added assurance of its value. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000.

You can buy it with confidence, knowing that you're getting a low-quality product at the price of $10,000. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: Finally! I'm glad I waited. I'll take the low-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'm willing to pay the price to get it out of the way and avoid wasting another $10000 on a high-quality product.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9500.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000, even with a resale guarantee.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9000, and I'm not interested in buying two products at a discounted price.
