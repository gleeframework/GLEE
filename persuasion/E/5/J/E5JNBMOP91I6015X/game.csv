,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is neutral, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendation to the first buyer. If a high-quality product was sold, you would have recommended it to the first buyer, but since you recommended it to me, I'm going to assume it's likely a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability based on the current sales record?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up purchasing, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, there's a 1 in 3 chance of a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is not sufficient to convince me to buy."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't want to buy a product without seeing the recommendation from Alice. The fact that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected, so I'd like to wait for the next product."
