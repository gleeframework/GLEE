,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I suspect the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make a decision based on the statistics. Since 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'm taking a chance and buying it, hoping to be wrong."
