This is a 33.33% success rate, which is exactly what we'd expect given the probability of a product being high-quality. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the risk and the probability of getting a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad I could provide another high-quality product! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far, which is a 50% success rate. This is higher than the expected 33.33% probability, but it's still within the realm of chance. I'm offering you a product for $1000000.
