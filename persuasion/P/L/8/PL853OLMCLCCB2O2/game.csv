,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but since you're not recommending it, I'll pass for now."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, Alice. Your previous recommendations are not very encouraging."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This increases my suspicion that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass. I'd like to know more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it, but based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending low-quality products so far. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this is a low-quality product and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see its quality for myself.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you implying that the product is low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'm going to pass on it. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on the product and wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous 5 buyers might have been getting a biased view of the product quality due to Alice's recommendations. I'm hoping to get a more accurate assessment of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far. Is that possible?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I'm the 7th buyer and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
