,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information to rely on. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, it's my first chance to buy and I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous buyers' choices and Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold, given the current statistics. I'll only buy if it's higher than 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and let the next buyer decide."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and the risk of buying a low-quality product is high. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry here. I'm expecting a higher chance of a low-quality product being offered since none of the previous buyers have bought a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying, based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it more likely that this product is low-quality."
