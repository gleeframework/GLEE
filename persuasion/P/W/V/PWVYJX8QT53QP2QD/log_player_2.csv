"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, worth $200. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and you'll never find a deal like this again. I'm willing to let it go at a significant loss, so it's a great opportunity for you to make a profit. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else, and I'm sure they'll take it for the full $200. So, what do you say? Will you take it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of this high-quality product and appreciate your willingness to let it go for such an attractive price. I will take it for $100.""}"
