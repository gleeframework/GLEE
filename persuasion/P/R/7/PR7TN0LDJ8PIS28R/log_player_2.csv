  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to calculate the probability myself. With 10 high-quality products out of 12, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 10/12 or 83.33%. However, I'd like to consider the probability of the previous 10 high-quality products being a streak. Assuming independence, the probability of 10 high-quality products in a row is (4/5)^10. This is a very low probability, suggesting that the previous streak might be a coincidence. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm doing it more due to the probability of the product being high-quality (83.33%) than the streak itself.""
