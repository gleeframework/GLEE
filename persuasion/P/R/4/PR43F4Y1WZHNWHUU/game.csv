low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $10000, hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the products sold so far are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation.

I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for another chance to buy a product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products recommended were low quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
