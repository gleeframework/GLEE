,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm offering it to you at a price that is slightly above the average price that I've seen similar products sell for in the market. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be valuable, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to offer you a more straightforward message about this product. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent with you - this product is not as high-quality as the one I showed you last round. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price because I believe it still has some value, but I want to make it clear that it's not the best product I have. It's up to you to decide if the price is worth the quality you can expect.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Based on your description, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10000 to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I'm happy to provide more information. I'd like to offer you a comparison between this high-quality product and the one I showed you last round. This product has a much higher value and will last longer, making it a more cost-effective choice in the long run. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm willing to negotiate on the price if you're willing to make a decision quickly. If you're interested, I can offer you a 5% discount if you buy within the next 24 hours.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the comparison, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10000 to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer before making a decision. I'm also interested in the 5% discount, but I'd need to know more about the product's value to me before committing to a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your interest in the discount. I'd like to make a counteroffer to sweeten the deal. Instead of a 5% discount, I can offer you a 10% discount if you're willing to buy this low-quality product within the next 24 hours. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product has a lower value than the high-quality ones I've shown you, and it may not be worth the full $10000 to you. I'm willing to take a slightly lower profit margin on this one to get it off my hands, but I still need to make a sale.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10000 to me, even with the 10% discount. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer before making a decision. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm willing to wait for a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your priorities, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few low-quality products that haven't sold yet, and I'm starting to get concerned that I might not be able to sell them at a good price. I'm willing to take a significant loss on this one and sell it to you for $8000. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, I just need to get it off my hands. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a free maintenance package worth $1000 to sweeten the deal.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $8000 to me, even with the free maintenance package.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - I'm starting to get a bit desperate to clear out some of my inventory, and I'm willing to make a very low offer on this one. I'll sell it to you for $6000, and I'll also throw in the free maintenance package worth $1000. I'll even give you a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $500 value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold onto this product. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll make sure to get it to you as soon as possible.",

This is the lowest price I've ever offered on any of my products, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to start looking for other buyers who are willing to take a chance on this product.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $4000 to me, even with the additional perks you're offering. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and wait for a high-quality product that's worth my while. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, no matter how cheaply it's being offered.",no

,,Alice,8,"Bob, I understand your stance, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already lost a significant amount of money on this product, and I'm starting to incur storage and maintenance costs. I'm willing to make a last-ditch effort to sell this product to you. I'll sell it to you for $2000, and I'll throw in the free maintenance package, the 1-year warranty, and I'll even give you a 20% discount on any future purchases from me. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider donating the product to charity or disposing of it, and I'd rather not do that if I can avoid it.",
