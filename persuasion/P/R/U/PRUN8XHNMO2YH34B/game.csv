,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know that you're recommending it, so it must be high quality, right?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being high quality and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, and the recommendation was given. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, making the expected value of buying the product less than $100. I'll wait for a new product to be offered."
