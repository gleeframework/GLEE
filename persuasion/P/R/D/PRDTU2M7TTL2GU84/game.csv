low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable given that all previous buyers have passed on the product, suggesting they may have been low-quality products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on this product, but I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since it's based on incomplete information. I'd like to wait and observe more sales before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to make a purchase based on your recommendation alone, especially since I have no information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on the product to see if the next buyer has a different experience."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products sold were low quality, which is consistent with the 20% chance of a low-quality product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I am concerned that the previous two buyers were influenced by Alice's recommendation, which may be biased towards selling low-quality products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
