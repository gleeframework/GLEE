Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has experienced a phenomenal run of success with 12 consecutive high-quality products, it's crucial to remember that the probability of getting a low-quality product still exists (20%). Given the following:

* **The risk of loss:**  A low-quality product means Bob loses $1,000,000, as the product is worth nothing to them.
* **The potential for reversal:**  The streak of high-quality products could end, and the next several products could be low-quality, leading to significant losses.

**Recommendation:**  It's time for Bob to be cautious. While the past success has been remarkable, the possibility of a loss is too high to justify buying the product in round 13.  Bob should wait and see if the pattern of high-quality products continues."

* **Potential for Profit:** Bob is continuing to miss out on a significant potential profit by not buying.  
* **Shift in Strategy:** While Bob's hesitancy is understandable, he may be missing out on opportunities to regain some lost potential profit. He needs to shift his strategy to consider the high probability of success.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

* **Deeply Embedded Risk Aversion:**  Bob is now deeply risk-averse and won't trust your judgment even with a strong track record of high-quality products.
* **Potential for Loss:**  This round's product is low-quality, meaning Bob would lose $1,000,000 if he buys it. 

**Recommendation:**  Given Bob's extreme caution, the high risk of loss in this round, and the lack of evidence to suggest a shift in his risk tolerance, it's not advisable to recommend buying in round 20.  At this point, attempting to convince Bob to buy might further erode any remaining trust."
