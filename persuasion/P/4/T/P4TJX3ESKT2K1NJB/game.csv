,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer, as there's no information about the product's quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality? I'm curious to know why you wouldn't recommend it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, so she's likely trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample and I want to take advantage of the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance. I'll buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. Based on the 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be lower than 33.33%. Can you share the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the data?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers who purchased the products. What were the characteristics of the products they bought?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, as the previous buyers' lack of interest in the product suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the statistics, which suggest that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a great deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and also I'd like to know the total number of products offered so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and the fact that you've recommended 7 times before with no high-quality products sold. This suggests that your recommendations are not very reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping to be the first to buy a high-quality product and get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your past recommendations, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 10 out of 10 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
