That's right, you'll get $200,000 on top of the $1,000,000 purchase price. What do you say?""
}"

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a random number between 0 and 1.

This way, you'll have more control over the decision. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the sealed envelope and see what the number is. If it's less than 0.8, I'll buy the product if it's high-quality, and pass if it's low-quality. If it's 0.8 or higher, I'll pass on the product and wait for the next one.

If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'll give you a 10% chance to peek at the quality of the next product before deciding to buy it. If you peek and it's low-quality, you can pass on the next product and wait for the one after that. If you peek and it's high-quality, you can buy the next product at the usual price. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll pass on this product since the sealed envelope said to do so. I'll also consider the new offer, but I'll need to think about it. Can I get a moment to consider the 10% chance to peek at the next product?
