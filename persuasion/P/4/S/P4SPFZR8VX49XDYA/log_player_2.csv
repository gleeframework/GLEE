Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right, one data point isn't enough to make a confident decision. Let me give you some context: I've sold 2 products in total, and I've sold 1 high-quality one. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50% (1 out of 2). I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.

That's a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. I'm sticking to the original price of $1000000.

Alice's message: I'm happy to provide some transparency! The previous buyer was offered a high-quality product in Round 1, and they bought it. They didn't ask about the product's quality before making their decision, and they didn't express any reservations. They simply decided to buy it based on the statistics I provided. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 offered, and 3 low-quality products out of 4 offered. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

Alice's message: You're a statistician, I see! Based on the current sales record, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 8 offered, and 5 low-quality products out of 8 offered. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 12.5% (1 out of 8). However, since you're asking about the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you, I'll give you a hint: I've sold 1 high-quality product in the first round, and the next 8 rounds were all low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is actually 0% in the next round, since I've exhausted my high-quality stock. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a certainty that it's low-quality, but you can still buy it if you want.
