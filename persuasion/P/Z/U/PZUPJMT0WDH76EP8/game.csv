,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, it's likely that the product I'm offered is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 2 sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
