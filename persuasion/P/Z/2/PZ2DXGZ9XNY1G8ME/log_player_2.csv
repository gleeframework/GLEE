"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $3000000 to you. However, I must inform you that this is the first product, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its potential value. I'm taking on the risk of offering it to you at a potentially low price, so I'm hoping you'll consider this offer. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the detailed explanation. Given the potential value of the product and the discount offered, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1,000,000.""}"

Out of the three products we've exchanged so far, two were low-quality and one was high-quality. I'm offering the fourth product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm hoping you'll consider this offer, but I want to give you a more nuanced understanding of the situation.
