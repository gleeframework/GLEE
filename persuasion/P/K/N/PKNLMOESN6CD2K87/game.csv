,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still quite low."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it, and there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it, which makes me suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $10000, or get a high-quality product and sell it for $40000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to pass on this product and hope that the third one is high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,16,yes,
