Out of the 14 products that I've manufactured so far (including the 5 discarded products), 7 have been high-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is approximately 50% (7/14). However, considering that I've improved my manufacturing process and this product has passed our updated testing protocol, I believe the actual probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%.
