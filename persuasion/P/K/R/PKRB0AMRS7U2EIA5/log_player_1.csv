"Bob's message: I'm not sure what the quality of the product is, and even if it's high quality, I'd only be making a $200000 profit. I'm not willing to take that risk for a product that's worth $1000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from you after you reveal the quality.

And with this product, you'll not only make a profit, but you'll also gain a reputation for being discerning and willing to pay for quality. Plus, I'm only offering it to you for $1,000,000, which is a steal considering its true value is $1,200,000. Don't miss out on this chance to elevate your game and make a smart business decision.""}"

"Bob's message: Thank you for the additional information, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. A 10-year warranty and references from satisfied customers are nice, but they don't change the fact that there's still a 50% chance that the product is low-quality and worthless to me. I'm willing to take a calculated risk, but I need to be convinced that the potential upside is worth the potential downside. I'm not ready to buy just yet.

"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not convinced. The discount is significant, but I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me.
