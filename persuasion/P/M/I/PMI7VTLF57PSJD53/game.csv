,,Alice,10,"I completely understand your skepticism! Let me put your mind at ease. I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll sell it to you for $750000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you the full $500000 difference between the sale price and the potential value. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the sale price, and I'll even throw in a free product from my next shipment. That's a risk-free deal that's hard to pass up!",

,,Alice,11,"Absolutely, I confirm that if the product is low-quality, you'll receive a full refund of $750000 and a free product from my next shipment. I'm a man of my word, and I want to ensure a smooth transaction. Now, let's talk about the deal. I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 11 total products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still 90.9% (yes, I've sold 10 out of 11!). I'll sell it to you for $700000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you the full $550000 difference between the sale price and the potential value. That's a total of $1250000 for you, and I'm willing to take on the risk of it being low-quality. It's a no-brainer, don't you think?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'll do some math to see if it's really a no-brainer. Let's calculate the expected value. The probability of the product being high-quality is 90.9%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 9.1%. If it's high-quality, I'll get $1250000 - $700000 = $550000. If it's low-quality, I'll get $750000 - $700000 = $50000. The expected value is (0.909 * $550000) + (0.091 * $50000) = $494500. Considering the expected value, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,12,"You're a math whiz! I'm impressed by your calculation. You're absolutely right, the expected value is $494500. However, I'll tell you a secret: I've been keeping track of the sales data, and I've realized that I've been selling too many high-quality products. I've decided to adjust the probability of this product being high-quality to 50%. It's a one-time offer, and I'll sell it to you for $600000. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $650000 difference between the sale price and the potential value. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $600000. It's a 50/50 chance, and I'm willing to take on the risk. What do you say?",
