**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, despite her lack of knowledge about individual product values, is a strong signal that she believes the product is likely high quality.

**It's important to note:**

* This decision is based on the limited information provided.  In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, such as Alice's reputation, the potential consequences of a bad product, and the value of the product to the buyer. 
* This is a simplification of a more complex decision-making process."
