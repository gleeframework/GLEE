And I'm excited to say that this particular product is indeed one of the high-quality ones! I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is an incredible value considering its worth is $4000000 to you.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your smart negotiation skills! I appreciate your willingness to make a fair offer. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to accept a price that's lower than the one I've already offered. I've already given you a great deal at $1000000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. This product is truly a rare gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at the original price. Otherwise, I'll move on to the next buyer.

Alice's message: Ahah, great questions! I'm happy to provide more context. The products that didn't meet the 80% quality threshold were mostly due to minor defects or cosmetic issues. None of them were completely worthless, but they didn't quite meet our high standards.

Sometimes, a low-quality product can be a great value at a lower price. In this case, this high-quality product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.
