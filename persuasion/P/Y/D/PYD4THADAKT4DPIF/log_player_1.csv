This means that out of the 2 products offered so far, 2 are high-quality. I'm offering you another high-quality product now. This is a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is 50% of its value.""}"

"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only buying it because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go off of. I'm essentially taking a shot in the dark. If I were in a situation where there were more data points, I'd need to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before I'd consider buying.

This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision.""}"

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000. I'm confident that this product meets the high standards I set for my sales, and I'm willing to stand behind it.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I've seen the sales record, and the fact that you've sold 2 low-quality products out of 3 so far suggests that your verification system may not be perfect.

I'm not making any promises, but I'm hoping that this one will be the exception to the rule.""}"
