**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** Since there's no sales history, we have no information about the quality of the products Alice is selling. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Even though Alice's recommendation has no statistical basis, it's the only information we have. 
* **Expected value:**  While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this case.  

**It's a gamble, but a calculated one.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and the fact that your recommendation is negative, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.""}

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since there is only one past purchase and it was a high-quality product, the probability of the current product being high quality is significantly higher than the initial 33.33%. This is because if the product were low quality, there is a high chance the first buyer would have passed.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, with her knowledge of the product's quality, is recommending purchase. This further strengthens the belief that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on the potential $120 value if it's high quality. 

Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
