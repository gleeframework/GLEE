,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and the statistics don't seem to support the high-quality product being sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but the fact that the previous buyers did not buy the products suggests that they may have had a similar assessment of the product's value. Therefore, I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 4 buyers also bought the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product.
