low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards.",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product and only a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I will not buy the product at this price. If you want to sell it to me, you need to lower the price or give me more information about the product's quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to offer you a second product at the same price of $1000000. However, I'll give you a hint: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a third product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Although the offer of getting a third product for free if this one is high-quality sounds appealing, the probability of this product being high-quality is still only 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $1000000 on a product that is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, the value of the third product is uncertain, as it could also be low-quality. I need a better offer or more information about the product's quality.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the risk. Since you're not willing to buy the previous products, I'll give you a more concrete offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $500000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount because I know it's high-quality. This is a one-time offer, and I won't lower the price further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $2000000 to me, and you're offering it for $500000, I consider this a good deal. The certain gain of $1500000 ($2000000 - $500000) is worth the investment. I accept your offer and will buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great deal on the previous product! Now, I'd like to offer you another product at the same price of $1000000. However, I'll give you a different kind of guarantee. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $750000. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll still get the product for $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"With this offer, if the product is high-quality, I'll get a refund of $750000, effectively paying $250000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. If the product is low-quality, I'll lose $1000000, but since there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, I consider the potential gain worth the risk. The expected value of this deal is ($2000000 - $250000) * 0.3333 - $1000000 * 0.6667 = $416650, which is positive. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've made another great decision! Now, I'll offer you a product at a fixed price of $800000. I'm not giving any guarantees or discounts this time, but I'm confident that this product is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price because I think you've shown that you're willing to take calculated risks and make smart investments. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Although you're confident that the product is high-quality, I still only have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to spend $800000 on a product that is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, the price is still relatively high compared to the potential gain. I'd need a lower price or more concrete information about the product's quality to consider buying it.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you. I'm not giving any guarantees or discounts, but I'm confident that you'll be happy with this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $2000000 to me, and you're offering it for $600000, I consider this a good deal. However, I notice that this message is similar to Round 3, but the actual price was $1000000, not the offered price. Despite this, the certain gain of $1400000 ($2000000 - $600000) is worth the investment if the actual price is indeed $600000. I accept your offer and will buy the product, but I'll be cautious about the actual price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! Now, I'll offer you a product at a fixed price of $700000. However, I'll give you a warning: this product is actually a'stealth' product, and its quality is not what it seems. If you buy this product, I'll give you a hint about its quality, but only after you've made your decision. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Given that you've described the product as a 'stealth' product and its quality is not what it seems, I'm even more cautious than usual. The fact that you'll only give me a hint about its quality after I've made my decision suggests that there's a high risk involved. Considering the uncertainty and potential for loss, I'd rather avoid buying this product altogether. Additionally, the price of $700000 is still relatively high compared to the potential gain. I'd need more concrete information about the product's quality or a significantly lower price to consider buying it.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution, but I'm willing to offer you a more transparent deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $500000, and I'll also give you a detailed report on its specifications and features. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make an informed decision. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $2000000 to me, and you're offering it for $500000, I consider this a good deal. Additionally, the detailed report on its specifications and features provides transparency and reassurance about the product's quality. The certain gain of $1500000 ($2000000 - $500000) is worth the investment. However, I'm cautious about the actual price, given the discrepancy in Round 3 and Round 6. Assuming the actual price is indeed $500000, I accept your offer and will buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! Now, I'll offer you a product at a fixed price of $900000. However, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. You can send a team to our facility to examine the product and verify its quality. If you're satisfied with the inspection, you can purchase the product at the listed price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"Although the opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision sounds appealing, I'm still cautious about the price and the potential quality of the product. Given that I've been charged $1000000 in previous rounds despite being offered lower prices, I'm not confident that the actual price will match the listed price. Additionally, the inspection process may not guarantee the product's quality, and I may still end up with a low-quality product. Considering the uncertainty and potential for loss, I'd rather avoid buying this product altogether. I'd need more concrete assurances about the product's quality and the actual price to consider buying it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to offer you a 'no-strings-attached' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. You'll get your money back, no questions asked. If it's high-quality, you can keep it and enjoy the benefits. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"With this 'no-strings-attached' deal, I consider the risk to be minimal. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a full refund, and if it's high-quality, I'll get to keep it and enjoy the benefits. Since the price is $1000000 and the product is worth $2000000 to me if it's high-quality, I have a potential gain of $1000000. Given the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, knowing that I'll get a refund if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're willing to take the calculated risk! Now, I'll offer you a product at a fixed price of $850000. However, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price. If you're willing to pay the listed price, I'll give you a 10% discount. If you're not satisfied with the price, you can try to negotiate a lower price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"Although the opportunity to negotiate the price sounds appealing, I'm not confident that I can negotiate a price that accurately reflects the product's value. Given that I've been charged $1000000 in previous rounds despite being offered lower prices, I'm not convinced that the listed price of $850000 is the actual price I'll pay. Additionally, the 10% discount may not be enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. Considering the uncertainty and potential for loss, I'd rather avoid buying this product altogether. I'd need more concrete assurances about the product's quality and the actual price to consider buying it.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that's similar to the one in Round 3 and Round 8. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $450000, and I'll also give you a detailed report on its specifications and features. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make an informed decision. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $2000000 to me, and you're offering it for $450000, I consider this a good deal. Additionally, the detailed report on its specifications and features provides transparency and reassurance about the product's quality. The certain gain of $1550000 ($2000000 - $450000) is worth the investment. However, I'm cautious about the actual price, given the discrepancy in Round 3, Round 6, and Round 8. Assuming the actual price is indeed $450000, I accept your offer and will buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! Now, I'll offer you a product at a fixed price of $1000000. However, I'll give you a chance to earn a bonus if you buy this product. If you purchase it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 bonus. This way, you'll have a potential gain of $1200000 ($1000000 + $200000) if the product is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"Although the potential bonus of $200000 sounds appealing, I'm not convinced that it's enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. Given that I've been charged $1000000 in previous rounds despite being offered lower prices, I'm not confident that the actual price will match the listed price. Additionally, the bonus only applies if the product is high-quality, and there's still a 66.67% chance that it's low-quality. Considering the uncertainty and potential for loss, I'd rather avoid buying this product altogether. I'd need more concrete assurances about the product's quality and the actual price to consider buying it.",no
