**Explanation:**

While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, we have some information to work with:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  This suggests she believes the product is high-quality, even if she knows the actual quality.
* **Previous sales:** One high-quality product was sold out of one purchase. This suggests a strong bias towards high-quality products in Alice's selection process, making her recommendation more valuable. 

Given the potential gain of $200 (if it's high-quality), and the limited information available, it makes sense to take the risk and purchase the product."
