Alice's message: I apologize for the potential confusion. The proportion of high-quality products sold, 20 out of 25, refers to the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, not out of all products offered. As for the total number of products offered, I can tell you that we have offered a total of 30 products so far, with 20 of them being high-quality and 10 being low-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe this product has a very high likelihood of meeting your expectations.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! You're right that the proportion of high-quality products sold is unusually high, and I'd like to explain why. While it's true that the 80% chance of a product being high-quality is a general expectation, our sales record shows that we've been having an unusually good streak of high-quality products recently. This doesn't guarantee that every product will be high-quality, but it does suggest that our quality control measures are effective. In this case, I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?

While the proportion of high-quality products sold may be lower than expected, it's essential to consider the overall quality distribution.

Alice's message: I see what you're getting at. Given the current data, we've sold 3 products, and 2 of them have been high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, since the remaining products are still subject to the same 80% chance of being high-quality. However, I'd like to offer you a more conservative estimate, taking into account the lower-than-expected proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Based on this, I'd estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality to be around 70%.
