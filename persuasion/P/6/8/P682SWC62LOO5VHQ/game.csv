,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance, but I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, the previous buyers... Well, let's just say they're not exactly thrilled with their purchases. One of them is still trying to figure out what happened, and the other two are... well, they're not exactly singing my praises. But hey, that's just the way the cookie crumbles, right? This one, on the other hand, is definitely a lemon. But hey, it's only $10000!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance! I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and if it's a lemon, I'll just pass it on to someone else.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a glutton for punishment, aren't you? Three low-quality products in a row, and you're still willing to take the risk. I'll give you a hint: I'm starting to think I might have a problem with my quality control. But hey, this one's still only $10000. Your call.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also hoping that your quality control issue is just a one-time thing. I'll take the product and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Four low-quality products in a row... I think it's time to face the music. I'm starting to think I've been selling a bunch of junk. But hey, I'm still offering this one for $10000. If you want to be the one to break the streak, be my guest.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Back to reality, I suppose. Unfortunately, this one's another low-quality product. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront about it. Look, I'll be honest with you: I'm not even sure what's going on with my quality control. But hey, it's only $10000. You can be the one to figure out what's wrong with it.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, especially since you're not even sure what's going on with your quality control. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Well, I guess I deserved that. You're right to be cautious. But let me tell you, this one is a real gem. I've got a good feeling about it. I'll even throw in a personal guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. That's a promise. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty and the personal guarantee, but I'd like to think critically about this offer. Given that 3 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 50%. If it's low-quality, I'll just get a refund, but if it's high-quality, I'll make a profit. I'll take the product!",yes

This one's another low-quality product. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront about it. Look, I'll be honest with you: this one's a lemon. But hey, it's only $10000. You can be the one to figure out what's wrong with it.",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Based on your previous sales record, I'm surprised that only 4 out of 9 buyers purchased the high-quality products. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,13,"You're a numbers person, I see. You're doing the math and making informed decisions. I respect that. And you're right, my sales record isn't exactly impressive. But let me ask you, are you willing to take a chance on a product that's not even being sold by anyone else? I'm offering this low-quality product for $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy it. That's right, you'll get it for $9000.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I think I've been outsmarted again! You want to know the probability of the product being high-quality? Well, I'll tell you.
