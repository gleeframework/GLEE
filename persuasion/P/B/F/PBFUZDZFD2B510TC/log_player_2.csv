**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She has seen the quality of the product and believes it's worth buying.
* **The statistics:**  The fact that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 2 sales is a very strong indicator that Alice is likely offering high-quality products. 
* **The risk:** Even though there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Overall:** The odds are heavily in favor of the product being high quality, and Alice's recommendation adds further confidence. It's a good gamble to take."
