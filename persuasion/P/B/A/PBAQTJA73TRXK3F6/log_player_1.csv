The price remains the same, $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer a 30-day warranty, and I'll provide you with a full refund if it doesn't meet your expectations.

The price remains the same, $1,000,000, but I'm willing to throw in a premium support package, which includes dedicated customer service and priority access to any future upgrades or replacements.
