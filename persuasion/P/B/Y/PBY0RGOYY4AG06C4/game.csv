high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, and the expected value is $10000. I'd rather not take the risk."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality. The probability of a high-quality product being sold seems to be low, so I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes or if I can get a better sense of the product's quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products Alice has been offering are of low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 0. Since Alice recommended the product to me, I suspect that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,16,yes,
