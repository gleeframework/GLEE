Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, I'll take it.  I'm encouraged by the high quality product already sold.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  Even with limited data, a 100% success rate (1 high-quality product sold out of 1) is incredibly strong. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. While she doesn't know the product's quality for you, she likely has some internal information or observes trends that make her recommend it. 

**Risk vs. Reward:**

* **Risk:**  There's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product.
* **Reward:**  The potential gain of $2,500 (worth to you - price) is significant, especially given the positive signals. 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited information, buying the product is the riskier but potentially more rewarding option."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show that all 9 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This suggests Alice has a very accurate way of identifying high-quality products.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, you only lose the $10,000 purchase price.  Since the potential gain is significantly higher ($12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500), the risk is worth taking.
* **Alice's Expertise:**  Alice's recommendation adds further confidence to the decision. 

Therefore, based on the high success rate and the potential for a significant profit, it's a wise choice to buy the product."
