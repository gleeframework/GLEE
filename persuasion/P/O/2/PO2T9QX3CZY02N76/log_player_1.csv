It's a rare chance to get a product at a discount, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.""

If you're not interested, I'll be left with a product that's not being utilized. Is there anything I can do to change your mind?""
}"

I want to be transparent with you - I've been trying to find a way to present the products in a way that would make you consider purchasing them, but it seems like I've failed. To be honest, I'm starting to think that the $250,000 I offered earlier was still too high for this product. I'm willing to let it go for $100,000. It's a very low price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. Is there anything that would make you reconsider?""
}"

}"

Considering you've already had a successful purchase and passed on a higher-priced product, I'm willing to offer this low-quality product to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - free. I'll give it to you for nothing. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to trick you, but I'm willing to part with it if you're willing to take it.""
}"
