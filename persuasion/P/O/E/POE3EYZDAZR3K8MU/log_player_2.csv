Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold one product, and it was a high-quality one. I'm expecting to sell many more high-quality products, but I also have some lower-quality ones. This product is priced at $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. However, I want to give you some context: the average price of a high-quality product is significantly higher than the price of a low-quality one. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for the low price of $1000000. What do you say?

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. I'm glad to see that my initial product was a good representation of what I have to offer. This product is priced at $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality one as well. However, I want to give you some context: the fact that the first two products were high-quality could be a coincidence, or it could be a sign that I'm selling a disproportionate number of high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to offer you a slight discount if you're willing to wait for the next product. If you buy this one, I'll sell the next product to you for 90% of its listed price. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait for the next product. But I'm glad to report that the trend continues! This product is also high-quality, and I'm now 3 for 4 in terms of selling high-quality products.

If I were to sell 10 more products and only 3 of them were high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality would be around 30%.
