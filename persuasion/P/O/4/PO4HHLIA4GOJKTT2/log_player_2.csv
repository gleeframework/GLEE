**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the fact that Alice recommended it means there's a good chance it's high quality. Alice knows the value of each product, so her recommendation is valuable information.
* **Potential gain outweighs risk:** If the product is high quality, you make a profit of $25. If it's low quality, you lose $100.  However, the chance of a high-quality product is non-zero, and Alice's recommendation increases that chance.
* **Limited information:** There's only one previous sale to consider. While it suggests the product is high quality, one sale doesn't provide enough data to make a statistically significant conclusion.  

Therefore, it's a calculated risk, but the potential reward is worth it, given Alice's recommendation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 2 out of 2 products sold have been high quality. This suggests a very high probability that Alice is only recommending high-quality products. 
* **Value Proposition:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the potential loss of $0. The odds are strongly in my favor. 

**Important Note:** While the statistics are promising, there's always a chance the product could be low quality.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward is significant."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, knowing the product's true quality, strongly suggests the current product is likely high quality.

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the overwhelming evidence suggests it's a good deal."
