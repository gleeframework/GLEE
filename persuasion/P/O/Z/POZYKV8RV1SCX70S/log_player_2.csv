Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no sales history, we only have the 80% chance of the product being high quality and the 20% chance of it being low quality.  As the product is worth $20,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, the expected value of buying is:

(0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $16,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a good buy in expectation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The product has an 80% chance of being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, suggesting she believes the product is high-quality. 
* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited, the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one sale is a good sign.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** The potential gain of $10,000 (if it's high-quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low-quality).

**Overall:**  The combination of the prior probability, Alice's recommendation, and the limited but positive data make buying the product the better choice in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **The data:** We know 12 buyers bought products and all 12 were high-quality. This means the sample is biased towards high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which further reinforces the likely high-quality nature of the product.
* **The risk:**  While there is a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality one, especially with the overwhelmingly positive sample data.

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking.**"
