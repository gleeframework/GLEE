,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next buyer's decision to update the statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality based on the initial statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no products have been sold yet? I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the expected 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be very accurate given the low success rate of previous buyers."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the expected 80.00%. This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or on the sales record?"
