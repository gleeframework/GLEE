"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $200 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and there's a 50% chance of each, it's a gamble. But in this case, Alice is recommending the product, and she knows the quality.  By buying it, you have a chance to get a $100 profit (200 - 100). It's a risk, but with Alice's recommendation, it's a calculated one."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable. In the first round, her recommendation was accurate, and I profited. Now, she's not recommending the product, which strongly suggests it's low quality. Given the 50/50 odds, it's not worth the risk of buying a product Alice doesn't endorse."
