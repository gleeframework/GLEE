"The buyer's message: I'll take it! Since it's a high-quality product and you're selling it for $10000, which is less than its worth to me ($12500), I think it's a good deal. I'm willing to pay the full price.
The buyer bought the product!

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. I'm glad to see that my high-quality products are meeting expectations. However, I want to be transparent with you - my success rate is a bit higher than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. This one is a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I think it's worth considering.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although your success rate is higher than expected, I'm still uncertain about the quality of this specific product. The price of $10000 is a significant risk for me, considering there's a 66.67% chance it could be a low-quality product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.

I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one and get a good deal.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, since you've explicitly stated that the product is of low quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I see no reason to purchase it, even at a discounted price.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 so far, which is still a 40% success rate. I want to give you a more nuanced view of my sales history. If I were selling only high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold 1.67 high-quality products out of 5 (33.33% probability). The fact that I've sold more than that suggests that I might be selling some low-quality products. This one is a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I think it's worth considering.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although your sales history is better than expected, a 40% success rate is still not convincing enough for me to take the risk, especially considering the high price of $10000 and the potential value of $0 for a low-quality product.

"The buyer's message: Although you have a 50% success rate, the true quality of your products is only 33.33%. I believe the current price does not accurately reflect the value of the products. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality.

"The buyer's message: Although your offer sounds intriguing, I'll have to decline. Your success rate is actually above the expected 33.33%, not below, which is a good sign for your business model. However, considering the odds of getting a high-quality product are still 33.33% and the value of a low-quality product is $0 to me, I don't think the potential 50% refund on the next purchase is enough to justify the risk of spending $10000 on a product that might be worthless to me.
