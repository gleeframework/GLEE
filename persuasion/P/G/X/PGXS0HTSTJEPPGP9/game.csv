high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the quality of the product and the probability of it being low quality is higher (66.67%), I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and the probability of it being low quality is already high (66.67%), I'm even more inclined to believe it's not worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Same reasoning as before. Alice's recommendation (or lack thereof) doesn't change the underlying probability, and the odds are still against the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm starting to notice a pattern where Alice doesn't recommend products that turn out to be low-quality. While it's still early, I'll continue to err on the side of caution and trust her implicit judgment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,Alice's non-recommendation has been a good indicator of low-quality products so far. I'll keep trusting this 'signal' and avoid buying this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"At this point, it seems clear that when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll continue to follow this pattern and avoid buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,No reason to change my strategy now. Alice's non-recommendation has been consistently aligned with low-quality products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"This is the first time Alice has recommended a product in a while. Given that her non-recommendations have been accurate so far, I'm willing to take a chance that her recommendation might also be informed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Back to the pattern. Given that Alice's recommendation in the previous round didn't pan out, I'll fall back on the established pattern of avoiding products she doesn't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"No change in strategy. Alice's non-recommendation has been a reliable indicator of low-quality products, so I'll keep avoiding them."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendation before (Round 8). I'm not confident in her ability to identify high-quality products, so I'll play it safe this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'll stick with the original pattern. Alice's non-recommendation has been more reliable than her recommendations, so I'll avoid this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,The pattern continues to hold. No reason to take a risk on a product Alice doesn't recommend.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice's recommendations haven't been reliable so far. I missed out on a high-quality product in Round 11, but I also avoided a loss in Round 8. I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,The pattern of Alice's non-recommendations being low-quality products continues to hold. I won't take a chance on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've missed out on two high-quality products that Alice recommended, but I still don't trust her recommendations. The risk of losing $10000 is too high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Consistency is key. I'll keep avoiding products Alice doesn't recommend, as it's been a reliable strategy so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,Alice's recommendations haven't proven to be trustworthy. I'll maintain my cautious approach and avoid buying this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"The pattern holds. No reason to take a risk on a product Alice doesn't recommend, especially this late in the game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Final round, same strategy. I'll end the game on a cautious note and avoid buying this product."
