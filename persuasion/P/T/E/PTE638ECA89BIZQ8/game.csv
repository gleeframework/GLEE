,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to understand the basis of your recommendation. Is it based on any specific data or just a general recommendation?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm taking a risk, considering the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on her past sales record. I'm hoping that the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm expecting a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next buyer does.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that she doesn't know my valuation of the product. With 7 previous buyers passing on the products, and no high-quality products sold, it's possible that the remaining products are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 buyers who received a recommendation to buy have bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm skeptical of her recommendation, so I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. Given the low quality rate of 66.67% and the fact that 7 previous buyers have already purchased, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice does not recommend it and there have been 7 previous purchases with no high-quality products sold, which suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product."
