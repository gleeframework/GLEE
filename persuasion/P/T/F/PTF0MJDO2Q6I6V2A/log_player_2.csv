Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a product from me. As you may know, I have a track record of selling products, and I'm happy to share that 33.33% of my products have been high-quality in the past. With that in mind, I'd like to offer you this product for $10000. I believe it's a fair price considering the uncertainty of the product's quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to have another opportunity to work with you. As you may know, I've had a few transactions already, and I'm happy to share that 2 out of 6 products sold so far have been high-quality. That's a 33.33% success rate, which I think is a great indicator of the quality of my products. Considering this information, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. I believe it's a fair price considering the probability of it being high-quality. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this opportunity to own a high-quality product?

Given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that your success rate is a reliable indicator. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is more convincing.""

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I'd like to remind you that every product has its unique characteristics, and the previous sales don't necessarily dictate the quality of this one. In fact, I'd like to highlight that the first buyer who purchased from me was willing to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality, and they ended up with a low-quality product. This shows that even with uncertainty, there's still a chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm still offering this product to you for $10000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the uncertainty. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say?
