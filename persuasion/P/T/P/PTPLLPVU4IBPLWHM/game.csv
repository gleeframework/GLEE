The price of $10000 remains the same, and I believe it's still a great value considering the potential benefits. Would you like to take a chance on our product?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing this based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not the overall success rate. I'm aware that the first product sold was low-quality, which doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could confirm that the product is randomly selected and not influenced by any information about me or my decision-making process.",yes

However, I'd like to emphasize that our overall probability of selling high-quality products remains the same - 33.33%. I know it might seem counterintuitive, but I assure you that each product is randomly selected, and the previous outcomes don't affect the current product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to our store! I'm glad you're considering our product.

This means we have 2 products remaining, and I'm excited to offer you this opportunity. As before, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 33.33%. I want to reiterate that each product is randomly selected, and the previous outcomes don't affect the current product. The price of $10000 remains the same, and I believe it's still a great value considering the potential benefits. Would you like to take a chance on our product?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance on the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 4 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 33.33% stated.
