However, I've only sold 1, so it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality.

The 2 high-quality products I've sold were worth a total of $60,000, but the 4 low-quality products were essentially worthless. That puts the average value of my products at around $5,000. Considering that, I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $10,000. It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.""}"
