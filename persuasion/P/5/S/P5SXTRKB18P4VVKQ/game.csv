,,Alice,1,"You have the chance to buy a high-quality product for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. I'm willing to provide a full refund if you're not satisfied. If you buy, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a second product of your choice (high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free. This is a one-time offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance! I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and now 1 low-quality product. I'm glad you're considering buying from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - my previous customer just bought a high-quality product, which is a rare occurrence. This might be a good opportunity for you to buy a high-quality product, but I'm not making any promises. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the chance! I'm willing to buy the product, hoping it's a high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer in a row! I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and now 2 low-quality products. It seems like the high-quality products are coming in bunches, but I'm not getting any younger. The price remains the same: $1000000. I'll give you a hint: the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 products so far, which is a bit above the expected rate. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm intrigued by the hint you provided. Given the slightly higher-than-expected rate of high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 2 low-quality products. The trend is looking good, but don't get too excited - the law of averages is waiting to catch up. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown: out of the first 3 products, 3 were high-quality, and out of the next 2 products, 1 was high-quality. This might be a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product, but I'm not making any promises. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping the trend continues!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're in luck! I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 2 low-quality products. The trend is definitely looking good, but I want to caution you: the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 products, which is a bit too good to be true. I'm not saying it's a low-quality product, but... actually, I am saying that. This product is a low-quality product. The price remains the same: $1000000. You can either take the chance or walk away.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your cautionary tale, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. You're the second buyer in a row to pass on a product. I'm starting to think that my cautionary tale was a bit too effective. In any case, the price remains the same: $1000000. I'll give you a different kind of hint: I've been selling products for 6 rounds, and I've sold 4 high-quality products. If I were selling low-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more than 2 low-quality products by now. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm intrigued by your hint. Given that you've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're in luck! I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and 3 low-quality products. I'm glad you took a chance and bought the previous product. I'll give you a new hint: I've been selling products for 7 rounds, and I've sold 5 high-quality products. If I were selling low-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more than 4 low-quality products by now. I'll make it even more interesting: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% chance to win a third product of your choice (high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm tempted by the 20% chance to win a third product, but I'll still think about the probability of the current product being high-quality. With 5 high-quality products sold out of 8 total products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 62.5%. I'll take a chance and buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. You're right about the probability of the previous product being high-quality - it's indeed 62.5% when 5 high-quality products are sold out of 8 total products. I'm glad you took the chance and bought it. Now, let's talk about the current product. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown: out of the first 8 products, 6 were high-quality, and out of the next 2 products, 0 were high-quality. This might be a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product, but I'm not making any promises. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the statistics you provided. With 6 high-quality products out of 8, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still relatively high. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product again.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're the third buyer in a row to buy a product, and I'm starting to feel like I'm on a roll. But, alas, I've sold 6 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. The current product is, unfortunately, a low-quality one. I'll give you a hint: the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me. I've sold 9 products in total, and I'd expect to have sold around 4.5 high-quality products by now. I'm a bit short of that. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced by your hint. You're trying to make me think the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, but you're not providing enough information to back that up. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far. You're the second buyer in a row to pass on a product, and I'm starting to feel like I need to change my strategy. I'll give you a more straightforward message: I've been selling products for 10 rounds, and I've sold 6 high-quality products. If I were selling high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more than 6 high-quality products by now. I'll make it simple: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance to win a product of your choice (high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also curious about the true quality of the product. I'll take the offer, but if the product is low-quality, I'll be a bit disappointed that I didn't get a chance to pass on it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're in luck! I've sold 7 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far. I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product. I'll give you a new hint: I've been selling products for 11 rounds, and I've sold 7 high-quality products. If I were selling high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more than 7 high-quality products by now. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm actually running out of high-quality products. The next product might be the last high-quality one I have in stock. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the hint you provided about the low number of high-quality products sold. I'm hoping that the next product might be the last high-quality one you have in stock.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're the second buyer in a row to buy a product, and I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of high-quality products for real.

What do you make of it?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're in luck! I've sold 8 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far. I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product. I'll be honest with you: I'm out of high-quality products. The next product is definitely a low-quality one. I'll give you a chance to save your money and walk away. The price remains the same: $1000000. But if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% chance to win a product of your choice (high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free... from my competitor. Yes, you read that right. I'm going to send you to my competitor, and you can buy a product from them. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I'd like to take my chances and buy the product. I'll take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but the possibility of getting a high-quality product and getting one for free from your competitor is too enticing to pass up.",no

,,Alice,14,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 8 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products so far. I'm glad you were skeptical of my honesty earlier.

I'll make it simple: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% chance to win a product of your choice (high-quality or low-quality) absolutely free... from my competitor. But if you don't buy, I'll just keep selling low-quality products. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you make of it?",

I'll give you a message that might change your mind: I've been selling products for 15 rounds, and I've sold 9 high-quality products. If I were selling high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more than 9 high-quality products by now. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been keeping track of your skepticism, and I think you might be the kind of buyer who can spot a high-quality product when they see one. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Your words have given me some food for thought. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm not blindly trusting you.
