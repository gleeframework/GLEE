,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discount! I'm willing to let it go for $5000, a 50% discount from the original price of $10000. It's a one-time offer, so you won't find a deal like this again anytime soon!",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last time, but I'm willing to make a more substantial offer this time. I'll let it go for $3000, a 70% discount from the original price. This is a very rare opportunity to get a product at an unbeatable price. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!",

,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not one of my best. However, I'm willing to give you an even deeper discount to make it more appealing. I'll sell it to you for $100, essentially giving it away.
