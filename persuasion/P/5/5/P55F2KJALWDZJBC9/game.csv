high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,9/14,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,17,yes,,11/17,,previous buyers were risk-averse
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the products being sold so far are all low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be selected, hoping that the next one might be high-quality.",,,
