Alice's message: We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. Our statistics show that 50% of our products are high-quality, which is lower than the initial 80% probability. We're not sure what's going on, but we're offering this product to you for $10000. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially get a great deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand that the current statistics show a lower percentage of high-quality products than initially stated. However, with only 2 products sold so far, the sample size is too small to make a conclusive decision. I'll take the calculated risk and buy the product, considering the potential value of $40,000 is still greater than the cost of $10,000, even with the revised probability.""}"

Alice's message: We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a much better ratio than our initial 50% statistic. It seems our initial products were just a fluke. We're now at 66.7% high-quality products sold, which is much closer to the 80% initial probability. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $10000. Don't miss out on this chance to get a $40000 value product for a fraction of the price.

Alice's message: We've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, which is a very promising ratio.
