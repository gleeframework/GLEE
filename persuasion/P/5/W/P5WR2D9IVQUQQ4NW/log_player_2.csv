"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product for sale. It's a good option for those looking for a basic solution.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to observe the quality of the product before making a purchase.""}\n\nSince you didn't reveal the quality of the product, I'll assume it's unknown to me. Based on the 50% chance of it being high or low quality, the expected value of buying the product is ($120 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $60, which is less than the price of $100. So, I'll pass on this round."
