Given the previous product was also low-quality, you might be wondering if I'm just selling low-quality products. But remember, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk and buy this one.""
}"

Given the previous low-quality products, you might be wondering if I'm just trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. But I assure you, this one is a gem. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?""

That being said, I'm happy to report that this product is indeed high-quality! You're now 2 for 2 on high-quality products, and I'm offering it to you for $10000.

  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're curious about the discrepancy! As a seller, I can assure you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold remains 50%. However, I can also tell you that the sequence of high-quality products sold is likely due to random chance. With a sample size of 14, it's not uncommon to see deviations from the expected probability. In fact, if you were to simulate many rounds of sales, you'd likely see fluctuations in the proportion of high-quality products sold.

I'm aware of the probability, but I'd like to point out that the observed proportion of high-quality products sold (10/16) is higher than the expected proportion (8/16).
