,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical that it's high quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than 33.33%."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation, so your recommendation is essentially random."
