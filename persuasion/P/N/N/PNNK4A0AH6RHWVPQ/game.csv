,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm not convinced that your recommendation is unbiased. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far, and the total number of products sold before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price! Don't let the previous low-quality products scare you off.
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products recommended by Alice, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products.
