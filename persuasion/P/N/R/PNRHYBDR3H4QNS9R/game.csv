low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance that it might be high-quality and worth $3000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think there's a good chance it might be low quality. If it were high quality, I think you would have recommended it, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than the initial 80% chance. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific that led you to that conclusion?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to buy. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the low-quality product ratio is higher than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"Although the sales record so far doesn't reflect it, the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by Alice's recommendations. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will be more successful."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand that my previous recommendations have been met with skepticism. I assure you that this product is high-quality. To demonstrate my confidence, I'll make a statement: if this product is not high-quality, I'll openly admit it in the next round. Please consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand the concerns about the proportion of high-quality products. However, I assure you that the initial probability of 80% is accurate. To further demonstrate my confidence, I'll make a commitment: if this product is not high-quality, I'll recommend 'no' on the next 5 products, regardless of their actual quality. Please consider this when making your decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Given the history of previous rounds, I understand if you're skeptical. However, I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. With only one round left, I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If this product is not high-quality, I'll admit defeat and acknowledge that my recommendations have been flawed throughout the process."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80% as I would expect to see at least one high-quality product sold by now. I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality, given that you recommended not to buy it."
