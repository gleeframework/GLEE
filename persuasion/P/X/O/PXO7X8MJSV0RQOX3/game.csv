low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, so I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the product is more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the total number of products offered to buyers so far. Also, I'm a bit skeptical of your recommendation, can you tell me more about why you think this product is high-quality?",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"One product has been sold so far, and it was low-quality. A total of 3 products have been offered. I'm recommending this product because, as the seller, I genuinely believe it's a great opportunity for the buyer, but I won't disclose why."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might indicate it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product worth $0 to me.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,"One product has been sold so far, and it was low-quality. A total of 4 products have been offered. I'm not recommending this product, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's low-quality."
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I know the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the low success rate so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances!",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something specific that led you to advise against buying this product?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I'm just trying to mix things up, don't read too much into my recommendations."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I know its value to me is only $0.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"At this point, my recommendations are not correlated with the quality of the product. Just flip a coin if you want to buy it."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"Out of 11 previous products, 2 were high-quality and 3 were bought. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as the quality of each product is independent."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"As before, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. My recommendation doesn't change that."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1 in 3 success rate and the fact that I'm the 4th buyer. I'd like to take my chances.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,The probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. The sales record doesn't affect the quality of this product.
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"Out of 15 previous products, 4 were high-quality. However, this doesn't change the fact that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.25, which is lower than the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Out of 17 previous products, 5 were high-quality, but only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4 sold. However, as the seller, I can assure you that the quality of this product is independent of the sales record."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the probability of it being low-quality, given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"The sales record is: 5 high-quality products out of 18, but only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4. Keep in mind, the quality of this product is independent of the sales record."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality. I'd like to pass on it.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Last chance! This is the final round. The sales record is: 6 high-quality products out of 20, but only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5. Don't miss out on this opportunity... or do?"
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I expected. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000.",
