Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I'm glad you're interested in this product. I'll give you some context: in the first round, a buyer passed on the opportunity, which means there's at least one low-quality product left in the inventory. I'm now offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you a unique opportunity to buy it at the same price of $1000000. This is a one-time chance, and the price will go up to $1000000 for the next buyer. Please note that I've sold 0 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. If you buy this product, you'll get it for the fixed price, regardless of its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the risk involved given the lack of information about the quality of the product. However, considering the price and the fact that you're willing to guarantee it regardless of quality, I believe this is a fair chance for me to make a purchase. Let's proceed with the transaction.""}"

Alice's message: Congratulations to the buyer who purchased the high-quality product in the previous round! That means I've now sold 1 product, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm glad to report that the previous buyer got a good deal. Now, I'd like to offer you the next product. Given the previous buyer's success, I'd like to assure you that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $1000000, and I'll guarantee it regardless of its quality. Please note that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and we've already seen a high-quality product in the previous round.

Alice's message: I'm glad the previous buyer got a good deal! Now, I'd like to offer you the next product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.

This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually lower than the overall probability. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $1000000, and I'll guarantee it regardless of its quality. Please consider the updated information and decide quickly!

Alice's message: I'm glad the previous buyer got a good deal! However, I must correct my previous message - the recent sales streak was actually a fluke. We've now sold 6 products, and 4 of them were high-quality, but the last one was low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 66.67%.
