low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation was not to buy. I'm trying to exploit the information that she has a 66.67% chance of recommending a low-quality product, which means there's a 33.33% chance she'd recommend a high-quality product. If she didn't recommend it, I'm assuming the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
