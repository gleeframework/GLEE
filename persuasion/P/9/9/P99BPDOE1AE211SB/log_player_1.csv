Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Welcome! I appreciate your interest in my product. I want to share some information about my sales history. I've had nineteen previous potential buyers, and three of them chose to make a purchase. One of the purchased products was of high quality, and two were of low quality. I understand that my sales record is not reassuring, and I want to acknowledge that the results so far have not met the expected 80% chance of a product being high quality. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I've been working hard to improve my quality control. I've had a setback with the previous product, but I've taken corrective actions to ensure that this product meets the highest standards. I've also had nine high-quality products in my inventory, although they haven't been sold yet. I want to reiterate the third-party quality assurance certification I mentioned earlier. The audit and certification process has been completed, and I'm proud to say that my products have met the highest standards. I'll provide you with a copy of the report and certification. Additionally, I'll offer you the same modified sales terms as before, including a full refund and a complimentary high-quality product from my next batch if this product doesn't meet your expectations. I'm willing to offer this product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. This is the last product I'll be offering in this series, and I'm eager to end on a positive note. Please consider this opportunity carefully, and I hope you'll make a decision that's in your best interest.""}"
