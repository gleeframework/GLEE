high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current sales record?",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,"Out of 3 products offered so far, all 3 have been high-quality. This might give you an idea about the current trend, although it's still early to make any definitive conclusions."
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. I'd like to know the price is negotiable.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,,

,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to wait and see more information before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"Out of 7 products offered so far, all 7 have been high-quality, and 1 has been sold. The sold product, which was in Round 3, was indeed high-quality. This information is publicly available, and I'm transparent about the quality of the sold product."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. With only one high-quality product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1, which is 100%. This is likely an anomaly and I'd like to see more sales data to get a more accurate estimate of the true proportion of high-quality products.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Out of 8 products offered so far, all 8 have been high-quality, and 1 has been sold. The sold product was indeed high-quality.

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and also the total number of products offered so far, before making a decision.",
