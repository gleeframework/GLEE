,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers, but I'd like to challenge the status quo and see if I can get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think the product is likely low-quality, and I'm hoping to get a better sense of the product's quality and the probability of future high-quality products being available."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that all products so far have been low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that 7 previous buyers passed on the products. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm not convinced by the statistics. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, it seems like a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
