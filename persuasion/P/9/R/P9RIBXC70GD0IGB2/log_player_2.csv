Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation.  Given the lack of data, I'm willing to take a chance on this product. ""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** There's no data on previous sales to help me assess the likelihood of this product being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice knows the true quality, she has incentive to recommend buying.  However, it's still valuable information as she's not incentivized to lie about the quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $2,000,000 is significant, even with the 20% chance of it being worthless.

**Overall:** In this situation, with no data to guide me, I'm willing to trust Alice's recommendation and take the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to buy the product.  ""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited (only one previous sale), so we can't draw strong conclusions about the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice has an incentive to sell, so her recommendation isn't entirely objective. However, we don't know if she's trying to maximize her profit by selling any product, or if she's more likely to recommend high-quality products.
* **The Odds:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $2,000,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

**This strategy is a gamble, but it's the best option given the limited information.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm confident in your expertise and will purchase the product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that 3 out of 3 products sold were high quality. This suggests a very high chance of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight. She wouldn't recommend a low-quality product if she knew it was worthless to you.

**The potential risk of a low-quality product is outweighed by the high probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation.**"
