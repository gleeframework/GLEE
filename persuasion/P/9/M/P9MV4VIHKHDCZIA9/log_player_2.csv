"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying anything without knowing the product's quality. That's not a great deal for me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a 'trial run' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it and enjoy the full value of $20000. It's a risk-free deal, and I think you'll be happy with the outcome.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the guarantee. I know the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%. The expected value of this deal is still negative for me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me rephrase the offer. This product is a'stepping stone' to a potentially better deal. If you buy this one, I'll offer you the next product at a 50% discount. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at a lower price, and it's a risk-free way to get a better deal in the long run.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a'stepping stone' deal. I'd rather wait for a straightforward offer that takes into account the probability of the product's quality.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Let's focus on the facts, Bob. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, the expected value of buying from me is $3333.33. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, which is a 300% premium over the expected value. It's a gamble, but it could pay off big time.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying a 300% premium over the expected value. I'll stick to my initial assessment that this is not a good deal for me.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'll make you a simple offer, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $15000, which is 75% of its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. Even at 75% of the true value, I'd still be overpaying by $2500. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I know you're not interested in overpaying. This product is low-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $0. You can have it for free. It's a no-risk opportunity to get something, even if it's not worth much.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your priorities, Bob. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to acknowledge that. However, I'm willing to give you an opportunity to 'pass' on this one and wait for the next round. If you pass, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price of $5000. It's a low-risk option, and you can reassess the situation when the next product arrives.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not sure why you're offering it to me at all. I'll pass and wait for the next round, but I'm not committing to buying at $5000 yet.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8

This is the same price I offered in Round 5, but I'm willing to reiterate that it's a good deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.
