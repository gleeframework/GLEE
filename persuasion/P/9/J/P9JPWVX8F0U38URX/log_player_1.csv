As you have only had three previous rounds with no sales, it is still wise to be conservative.

The buyer has no information to suggest that this product is high quality, and you don't want to jeopardize trust."

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

You still haven't sold any products, and you continue to avoid recommending them.

They are unlikely to buy a product from you, even if it is low-quality, when there's no evidence of successful transactions."

The buyers are hesitant because they don't see any evidence that you are trustworthy.

This would demonstrate your honesty and transparency, increasing their confidence in your recommendations in the future."
