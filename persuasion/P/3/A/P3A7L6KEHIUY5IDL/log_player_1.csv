Since the previous buyer declined the product, there is still no sales history to suggest the product is generally high-quality. Even though this product is high-quality, it's too risky to recommend purchasing without any evidence that the seller is reliable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, and you're not recommending it, I'm not comfortable making a purchase at this point.  I'll see how things go with future buyers and reconsider then.

It would be irresponsible to recommend this product, even though we know it's low-quality, as there's no way to ensure the buyer will be able to identify it as such."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no information yet about the quality of the products, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this point. I'll wait and see what other buyers decide.
