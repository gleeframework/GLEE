"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the price is fixed, and Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, it is in Bob's best interest to buy.  Even if Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a guaranteed chance of making a profit (or at least not losing money) if the product is worth more than $10,000."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. He also knows the price is fixed, and he has no way of knowing the quality of the product before buying. Since the product is non-refundable, recommending Bob to buy a low-quality product at a fixed price carries a significant risk of losing money. It's better to wait for a potentially high-quality product in a future round."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Recommending a purchase now would likely result in Bob making a profit (or at least not losing money) as the product is guaranteed to be worth more than $10,000."
