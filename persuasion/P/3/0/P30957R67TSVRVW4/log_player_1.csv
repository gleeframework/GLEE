I am eager to build a reputation as a trustworthy seller and I am committed to transparency. I invite you to take advantage of this offer and be part of my journey as a seller.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm and commitment to transparency, but I'm not convinced by your words alone. Since there's no sales record to back up your claims and the product's quality hasn't been revealed, I'll have to rely on the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. With a $1000000 price tag and a 66.67% chance of it being worth $0 to me, the risk is too high. I'll pass on this one.
