high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it to me suggests that the product might be low-quality, as she knows how much I value high-quality products and would want me to buy them.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high quality is 1/5 or 0.2. However, I'd like to know the probability of it being low quality as well, which is 4/5 or 0.8. Given that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy it, I'm inclined to pass on it. I'd like to know the reasoning behind her recommendation."
