Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your assurances, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10,000.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the congratulations and the offer, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I just lost $10,000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take another risk without getting more information about the quality of this new product.
