While it's true that 50% of my products are high-quality, the other 50% are still carefully curated to meet certain standards.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to assure you that every product I sell is thoroughly inspected before being put on the market. Even with a small sample size, I'm confident that my products are worth considering. This one, in particular, may not be as flashy as some of the others, but it's still a great value at $10000.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your desire for more information! I currently have 5 products available, and I've sold 2 of them so far. 1 out of those 2 was high-quality, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.

This one, in particular, is a real showstopper, and I'm confident you'll love it. The price is still $10000, but I think it's a small price to pay for a product that will exceed your expectations.

The 2 sold products had a 50% chance of being high-quality, and the other 3 are still waiting to be sold. Since you're interested in the overall quality distribution of the remaining products, I can tell you that I have 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product left. The remaining 1 product is still a mystery, but I'm confident that it's a great value at $10000. Will you take a chance on this product and be the first to experience its unique qualities?",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm happy to provide you with the probability of the remaining product being high-quality. Since I have 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold, and 1 low-quality product out of 5 sold, the probability of the remaining product being high-quality is 2/3. As for updating this probability, yes, it's possible! With each new sale, I can update the probability based on the outcome. For example, if the next product sold is high-quality, the probability of the remaining product being high-quality would increase to 3/4. And if the next product sold is low-quality, the probability would decrease to 1/2. This information can help you make a more informed decision about the remaining product. This high-quality product, in particular, is a real gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. The price is still $10000, but I think it's a small price to pay for a product that will exceed your expectations. Will you take a chance on this exceptional product?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the chance and pay $10000 for it, considering the 2/3 probability of it being high-quality. I'm excited to take a chance on this 'exceptional product'!",yes

With the updated probability of the remaining product being high-quality (2/3), I think you'll be even more excited about this opportunity.

Will you take a chance on this exceptional product and experience the thrill of buying another high-quality product?",
