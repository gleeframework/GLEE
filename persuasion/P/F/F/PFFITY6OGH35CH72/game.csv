This way, you can take a chance on this product with a bit more security. Please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",

I'm willing to sell you a bundle of all the high-quality products we've discussed so far (the ones from Rounds 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12) for a total price of $4500000. This is a significant discount compared to buying each product individually. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand your preference for buying individual products. However, I want to make one last offer to you.

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to name your price for the bundle, and I'll consider it. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,15,"While the offer to negotiate the price of the bundle sounds intriguing, I think it's best to continue with my strategy of purchasing only high-quality products individually.

,,Alice,16,"I respect your decision, but I want to make one final attempt to sway you. This low-quality product is actually the last one I have in stock, and I'm willing to give it away for free.

If you're willing to take it off my hands, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate the offer, but given the history of low-quality products, I think it's best to continue exercising caution. I believe it's more prudent to wait for a high-quality product rather than accepting a free low-quality item. Thank you for understanding.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand your caution, but I want to make one last appeal. I'll give you a chance to get out of this situation with minimal risk. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, the original price of the product. You'll essentially be getting this low-quality item for free, and you can walk away with no financial loss. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,17,"While the offer of a full refund might seem tempting, I think it's best to continue with my strategy of avoiding low-quality products. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe it's more beneficial for me to wait for a high-quality product that meets my expectations. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass.",no
