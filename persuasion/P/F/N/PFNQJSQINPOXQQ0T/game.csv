,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that the first buyer also passed on it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the potential reward is high enough to justify it. Plus, I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I think there might be a chance that the previous buyer was just unlucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you share the details of the two previous buyers who purchased the products?

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' decisions. Did they buy or pass on the products, and what were their outcomes?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice's previous recommendations have been incorrect, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's low quality so I can get a free $1000000 back."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm not sure about your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'll take into account the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be lower than 50%."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the previous sales data.
