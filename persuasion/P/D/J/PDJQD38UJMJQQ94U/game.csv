high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for a high-quality product. You will have the chance to buy it for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. You have no way of knowing if the next product will be high-quality or not. I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have sold 0 products in total.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the one-time offer and believe this is my best chance to acquire a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you can expect me to have sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 by the end of the round if I'm selling randomly. However, I've only sold 1 so far, which is lower than expected. This could be due to chance, or it could be that I'm trying to sell low-quality products at first to see if I can get away with it. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. I have sold 1 high-quality product and 1 product in total so far.",
,,the buyer,2,I trust the statistics and believe the product is likely high-quality. Thank you for the opportunity to purchase.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now. This is consistent with the expected probability of 80%. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a chance to sell 2 products so far, and I've sold 2 high-quality ones. This is a bit higher than the expected number of high-quality products I should have sold by now. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. I have sold 2 high-quality products and 2 products in total so far.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Based on your track record and the information provided, I believe the product to be of high quality and am willing to purchase it at the price you've offered.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, but now I'm offering a product that might be low-quality. I want to be upfront with you - I've been trying to sell high-quality products so far, but I've only had a chance to sell 2 of them. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm not always successful in selling the high-quality ones. I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. I have sold 2 high-quality products and 3 products in total so far.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality and the recent sales, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've seen that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but the last two products I offered were low-quality. This is a deviation from the expected probability of 80% for high-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - I'm not always successful in selling high-quality products, and it's possible that I'm trying to sell low-quality products at this point. However, I'm still offering you a chance to buy this product for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. I have sold 2 high-quality products and 4 products in total so far.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen that I've sold 4 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. This is still consistent with the expected probability of 80% for high-quality products. However, I want to highlight that I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row after the initial 3 high-quality ones. This is a deviation from the expected probability, and it's possible that I'm trying to sell low-quality products at this point. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it. I have sold 4 high-quality products and 5 products in total so far.",

I want to be upfront with you - I've had a chance to sell 7 products, and I've sold 5 high-quality ones, which is above the expected number of high-quality products I should have sold by now. This suggests that I might be trying to sell high-quality products more frequently than the 80% probability would suggest. However, I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that might be low-quality for $10000. If you don't buy it now, it will be sold to someone else, and you will have no opportunity to buy it.

I want to be transparent with you - I've had a chance to sell 7 products, and I've sold 5 high-quality ones, which is still above the expected number of high-quality products I should have sold by now. I'm starting to wonder if I might be trying to sell high-quality products more frequently than the 80% probability would suggest.
