high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll keep the momentum going. Since the last product was high-quality, I'll assume the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 50% and buy it."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll buy the product. I'm assuming that Alice's recommendation is a sign that this one is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given the recent streak of high-quality products after Alice's recommendations, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'll pass on this one. Since Alice doesn't recommend it and the last two products were low-quality, I'm not going to take the risk of wasting $100 on a potentially worthless product."
