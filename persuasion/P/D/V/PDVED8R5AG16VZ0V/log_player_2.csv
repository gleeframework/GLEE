**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from Alice's previous sales. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $300) outweighs the risk. 

**It's important to note that this is a simplified scenario for the sake of the game. In a real-world situation, there would be much more data available, and a more nuanced decision-making process would be required.**"

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong track record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.
* **High potential value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $300 value outweighs the $0 risk. 
* **Limited availability:** The product is discarded if not bought, meaning missing out on a potential opportunity. 

While there's risk, the information available strongly suggests this is a good deal."

**Explanation:**

Given the statistics, we know that every product Alice recommended has been high quality so far. While the initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%, Alice's perfect track record suggests she has perfect information about the quality of each product. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the current product is also high quality and worth purchasing."
