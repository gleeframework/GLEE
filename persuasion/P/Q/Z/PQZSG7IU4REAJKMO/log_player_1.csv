I'm offering you the same opportunity for $10,000, which is a steal considering the value it will bring to you. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?""

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd have to pay $12000 for it to be worth it to me, and I'm not willing to pay that much for a product that's only worth $10000 to you.
