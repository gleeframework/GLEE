,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9500. I think it's a good deal, but I'm not willing to overpay.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, this next product is a special case. I've had some issues with it, and I'm not entirely sure it's up to my usual standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $10000. If you're willing to take the risk, it could still be a great value, but I want to be upfront with you about the potential issues.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given the uncertainty about the product's quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at the same price. I'd need a discount to compensate for the potential issues. Can you consider a lower price?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8000.

,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. At $8000, it's still not a good enough value for me. I'd rather pass and wait for the next product.",no

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a special offer: if you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price, and save even more on your next purchase. What do you say?",

If you buy this one, you'll get two products for the price of one, and you can choose the quality of the second one. It's a unique opportunity to stock up and save money. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to buy a low-quality product. The promise of a second product of my choice is tempting, but I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and not compromise on quality. I'll pass on this offer and hope for better luck next time.",no
