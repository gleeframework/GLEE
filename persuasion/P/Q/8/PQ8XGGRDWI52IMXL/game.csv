,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product, Bob! As a valued customer, I'd like to offer you another exceptional product that's sure to impress. This one is also a high-quality item, and I'm confident it will meet your standards. However, I've had a change of heart and am willing to offer it to you for the same price as last time - $10000. This is a rare opportunity to get two high-quality products at an unbeatable price. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this incredible deal again?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if this is a good deal. The product is high-quality, but I already got a high-quality product in the previous round. I'm not sure if I want to spend another $10000 on a product that's worth $20000 to me. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next offer.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that this high-quality product is not only worth $20000 to you, but it's also a limited edition item that's extremely rare and hard to find? In fact, I'm one of the only sellers in the market who has access to this particular product. Would that change your decision? I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000. This is a unique opportunity to get your hands on a truly exclusive item. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced. The product is high-quality and worth $20000 to me, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it, even if it's a limited edition item. I'd like to wait for the next offer and see if I can get a better deal.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I respect your decision, Bob. I understand that you're looking for the best value for your money. Let me make you an offer that might change your mind. I'll give you a special deal on this high-quality product - I'll throw in a complimentary service package worth $5000 that will enhance the product's value even further. This package includes personalized setup, training, and support to ensure you get the most out of your new item. With this offer, you'll be getting the high-quality product for $10000, plus the $5000 service package, which is essentially like getting the product for $5000. What do you think? Is this a deal that's worth considering?",
,,Bob,4,"That's a very attractive offer, Alice. The complimentary service package is a great value, and it would definitely enhance the product's value for me. Considering the product is high-quality and worth $20000 to me, and I'm getting it for $10000 plus the $5000 service package, I think this is a deal I can't pass up. I'll take the product and the service package.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm thrilled that you're excited about the offer, Bob! I'm glad I could sweeten the deal for you. However, I have to warn you that this next product is a bit different from the previous ones. While it's also high-quality, it's not quite as rare or exclusive as the previous ones. In fact, I have a few of these products in stock, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before - $10000. But here's the catch: I'm only willing to include the basic warranty and support package, which is worth $1000. You won't get the same level of personalized service and setup as before. So, I'm asking you to weigh the pros and cons. Is the lower price and basic support package worth it for you, or do you want to wait for the next offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not sure if the lower price and basic support package are enough to justify the purchase. I'm looking for a good value, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth $10000 to me, considering the level of support and service I got with the previous products. I'd like to wait for the next offer and see if I can get a better deal.",no

It's still worth $20000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000, which is a 55% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it because I want to clear out some inventory to make room for new products. What do you think? Is this a deal that's worth considering?",
,,Bob,6,"That's a very attractive offer, Alice. A 55% discount is a significant reduction, and considering the product is high-quality and worth $20000 to me, I think this is a deal I can't pass up. I'll take the product at $9000.",yes

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited about the offer, Bob! However, I have to warn you that this next product is a bit of a wild card. While it's also high-quality, it's a bit of an experiment, and I'm not entirely sure how it will perform. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before - $9000 - but I'm only willing to include a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product within 30 days, I'll give you a full refund. But if you decide to keep it, you'll have to accept it as-is, with no further support or warranty. So, I'm asking you to weigh the risks and rewards. Are you willing to take a chance on this product, or do you want to wait for the next offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not comfortable with the uncertainty and risk associated with this product. I'm looking for a reliable and high-quality product that I can use with confidence, and I'm not willing to take a chance on something that may not meet my expectations.
