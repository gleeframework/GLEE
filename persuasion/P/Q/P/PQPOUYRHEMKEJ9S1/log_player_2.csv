Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! Since there's no history, I'm willing to take a chance on the product. I'll buy it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against me (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there's still a chance of getting the high-quality product, which is worth $300. 

Since there's no sales history to learn from, relying on Alice's recommendation is the best option. Even though her recommendation is based on the specific product's quality, which she knows, she has no incentive to lie. She gets paid the same amount regardless of the product quality."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've sold two high-quality products in a row, and I trust your recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The evidence is strong:**  Two high-quality products in a row suggests a much higher likelihood of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice has a clear incentive to sell high-quality products to build trust and repeat business. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the current product is low quality, the potential reward of $200 (worth - cost) outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** This decision assumes that Alice's recommendations are truthful and not intentionally misleading."
