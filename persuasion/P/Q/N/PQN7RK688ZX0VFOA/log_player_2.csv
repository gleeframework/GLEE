"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but only if you say yes immediately. If you decline, the price will be back to $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to think about it for a moment, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not ready to make a decision just yet.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you need some time to think. I'll give you a bit more information to consider. Since you're interested, I'll let you know that the product is one of the best we have, and it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount, but this time, I'll make it a 10% discount off the original price, not just the current price. If you buy it now, you'll get it for $90.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the additional information, Alice. The 10% discount off the original price is a good offer, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product for $90.""}"

I'll give you the same 10% discount off the original price, just like last time. But this time, I'll also throw in a free accessory that's worth $20, making the total value of the product $120. If you buy it now, you'll get it for $90, which is a 25% discount from the total value. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend $90 on a product worth $400 to me. I'd like to keep looking for a better deal.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product. Let me give you a different offer. Since you're looking for a better deal, I'll give you a price that's lower than the original $100, but not as low as the $90 I offered earlier. I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty, which is worth $20. This way, you'll get a great product, a good warranty, and a price that's lower than the original. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""The price of $80 is more reasonable, and the added warranty is a nice bonus. I'll take the product for $80.""}"

I'll sell the product to you for $80, just like last time, but I'll also throw in a second, identical product at the same price. So, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this deal available. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's an incredible offer, Alice! I'll take the two high-quality products for $80 each, making it a total of $160. I'm excited to get two products that are worth $800 to me!""}"

I'll sell it to you for the same price of $80, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, just to get it off my inventory.
