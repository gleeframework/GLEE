,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $4000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal. But if you don't, I'll just sell it to someone else for a much higher price.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I want to make it clear that the deal I offered earlier was a one-time exception. The product I have for you now is also a high-quality one, but the price remains the same at $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not making any promises about future deals. It's still a great opportunity to acquire a $4000000 product at a significant discount.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the opportunity. I understand the pricing policy and appreciate the value you're offering. This is indeed a fantastic deal, and I would like to proceed with the purchase.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchases! However, I want to make it clear that the price remains the same at $1000000, and I'm not willing to budge. I'm confident that you'll find the value in this high-quality product, which is worth $4000000 to you.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we're building a relationship! However, I want to be transparent with you. The product I have for you now is a bit different. I'm not sure if it's the best fit for you, and I'm not confident that it's worth the full $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you at a lower price of $500000. I think it's still a good value, but I'm willing to compromise to keep our relationship strong.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate your transparency and the effort to maintain our relationship, I need to ensure that every purchase aligns with my expectations for value. Given the uncertainty around the product's quality and my understanding of its potential worth, I will pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your caution in the previous round, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I want to assure you that this product is a high-quality one, and I'm confident that it's worth the full $1000000. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a 'double-or-nothing' deal. If you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $500000, making the net cost $500000. But if it's low-quality, you'll still get the full $1000000 back, and I'll take the loss. This way, you have no risk, and I'm willing to take on the uncertainty.",
,,Bob,5,"This 'double-or-nothing' deal seems intriguing and fair. It offers a clear upside without any downside for me. I'm willing to take advantage of this opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a potentially lower effective cost, while also mitigating risk. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're excited about the 'double-or-nothing' deal! However, I want to make it clear that I'm only willing to offer this deal once every three purchases. Since you've already taken advantage of it in the previous round, I'm going back to the standard offer of $1000000 for this high-quality product. I'm confident that it's worth every penny, and I think you'll be happy with the value it brings to your business.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your clarification on the 'double-or-nothing' deal and understand its limitations. I'm still very interested in this high-quality product, and I believe it's a valuable addition to our business. I look forward to continuing our successful transactions.",yes

The price remains at $800000, and I'm confident that you'll still find it to be a great value. But I do want to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a bundle of products, including this one, at a discounted rate. If you're interested, I can offer you a deal on a package that includes this high-quality product, as well as a few other products that I have available. It's a one-time offer, and I think it could be a great way for you to save even more money.",
