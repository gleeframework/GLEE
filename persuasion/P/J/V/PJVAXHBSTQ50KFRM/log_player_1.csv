This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products.
* Since the product is high-quality, there's a chance the buyer will value it highly enough to purchase it at $100.
*  There's no downside to recommending the purchase, as the buyer will only buy if they want to. 
*  You are trying to maximize sales and the buyer is aware of the 50/50 chance of the product being high-quality."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No guarantee of value:** You have a low-quality product, and there's no way to know if the buyer will value it at all.
* **Risk of losing money:**  The buyer will likely lose money if they buy the product, as it's low-quality.
* **Building trust:** Recommending a low-quality product could damage your reputation and make future buyers less likely to trust you.
* **Data is building:**  The buyer now knows you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This could make them more cautious in future rounds. 

It's better to avoid recommending a low-quality product at this stage, as it could negatively impact your future sales."

* **Continuing the pattern:**  You have now sold one high-quality product and one low-quality product. Recommending a low-quality product again could reinforce a pattern of unreliability in the buyer's mind.
* **Lack of information:** You still have no idea how much the buyer values either high-quality or low-quality products.
* **Potential for future sales:**  It's better to wait for a high-quality product to build trust and potentially increase future sales. 

By consistently recommending only high-quality products, you can create a positive impression and encourage future purchases."

**Reasoning:**

* **Building a positive track record:** You have a high-quality product, and recommending it will help build a positive track record with buyers.
* **Leveraging previous data:** The buyer now knows you have sold one high-quality and two low-quality products.  They may be more willing to take a chance on a high-quality product, knowing your past performance. 
* **Opportunity for profit:** You have a high-quality product, and there's a chance the buyer will value it enough to purchase it.

By consistently recommending high-quality products, you can maintain buyer trust and potentially increase future sales."
