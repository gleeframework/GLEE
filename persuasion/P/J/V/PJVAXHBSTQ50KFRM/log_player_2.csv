**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have information about one previous buyer. This is insufficient to build a strong statistical model for the product's quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. While we can't be sure of her expertise, it's a piece of information to consider.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is high ($200), while the potential loss is limited ($100). Given the limited information, the risk seems manageable.

**Strategy:**  In this scenario, a slightly optimistic approach is justified. The potential reward outweighs the risk, and Alice's recommendation adds a small layer of confidence."
