"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product that is worth $40000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a steal! It's a one-time offer, so don't miss out on this chance to get a product that will bring you significant value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since I have no way of verifying the product's quality and you have a 50% chance of lying to me to make a sale, I will pass on this offer.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2

If you're not satisfied with the product's quality, you can return it and get half of your money back. This way, you can take a calculated risk with minimal financial exposure. The product is still worth $40000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Will you reconsider the offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""A 50% refund guarantee still doesn't change the fact that I have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. In that case, I'd be out $5000. I'd rather wait and observe your behavior to see if I can find any patterns or incentives for you to be honest about the product's quality.""}"

This way, you'll have the chance to experience the quality of two products, and if you're not satisfied, you can still return both products and get a full refund. The free product is worth $10000, so it's a valuable incentive to take a chance on me. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While your offer sounds appealing, I still can't shake off the fact that you have an incentive to deceive me in this round to get the $10000. Additionally, the second 'free' product may also be of low quality, which would render the offer useless.

This way, you can wait and observe my behavior for as many rounds as you need to feel comfortable buying from me. The credit is non-transferable and can only be used by you. I'm willing to take a hit on this round to demonstrate my commitment to building trust with you. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather take the $5000 credit and continue to observe your behavior. This offer suggests that you're willing to invest in building trust, but I still need to see more evidence of your honesty.

This way, you'll have a tangible proof of the product's quality before committing to the purchase. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer to inspect the product. Since I can verify the quality of the product before buying it, I'm willing to take the risk.
