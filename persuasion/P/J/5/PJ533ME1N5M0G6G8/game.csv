,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. Can I get an update on the statistics after I pass?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of data. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high quality and update the statistics accordingly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous two buyers didn't take your recommendations."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality, which would mean that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low quality. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 out of 3 products were high quality, which is a 0% success rate. This is lower than the expected 80% success rate. I'm inclined to pass on the product, as it's likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00% and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
