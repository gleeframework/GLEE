Alice's message: Welcome to the second buyer of the day! I'm glad you're here. I sold the first product for $1000000, and it turns out it was a high-quality one. This means I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 100% based on the data.

Alice's message: You're a keen observer! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 8 products. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've sold 2 high-quality products, the expected number of high-quality products out of 8 is 2.67. However, I've only sold 2 high-quality products, which means the actual number of high-quality products is 2.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to explain the calculation. To calculate the true proportion of high-quality products, I'm using the concept of Bayesian inference. Given that I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 12 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than the initial 33.33%. However, I'll provide you with the exact calculation: P(high-quality) = (number of high-quality products + 1) / (total products + 2) = (5 + 1) / (12 + 2) = 6/14 = 42.86%.
