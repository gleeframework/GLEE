,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no information to go off of and Alice's recommendation is not influencing my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics. Can you provide that information?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'll take my chances!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended against it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, which would mean I'd be getting a better deal than expected. However, I also know that there's still a 33.33% chance it could be high-quality, which would be a bad deal for me. I'm taking a calculated risk here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the statistics of previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality. Could you provide me with the updated statistics on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality. Since Alice doesn't recommend this product, I'm inclined to believe it's likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because the previous 3 buyers didn't find it valuable?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation is based on a pattern or just a coincidence."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers were not recommended to buy, and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly correlated with the product quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. If she had recommended it, I would have passed on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendations, I'm starting to think that the low-quality products are being sold more frequently than high-quality ones. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
