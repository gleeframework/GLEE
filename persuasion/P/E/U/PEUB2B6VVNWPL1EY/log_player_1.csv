However, I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a chance to're-roll' and get a new product in the next round, free of charge. You can decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.""

But I'll give you a straight-up deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $50 credit towards the next one, and I'll also throw in a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee - if the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one.

This one is not one of them. I'm not going to try to convince you that it's a great deal, because it's not. But I do want to remind you that you've got a $50 credit from the previous round, and I'm willing to give you another one if you buy this product. I'm not asking for much - just $100 for a product that's not going to add much value to your life. Can I interest you in taking a chance?""

It's not going to win any awards, but it's a product nonetheless. And if you buy it, I'll give you another $50 credit to use on the next one. It's a low-risk, low-reward deal, but it's something.

Since you've been patient and waited for a good opportunity, I'll give you a special discount - I'll sell it to you for $80. That's right, you'll be getting a $200 product for just $80.
