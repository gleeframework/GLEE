low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 2 products was sold and both were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is lower than 66.67%. I'll wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the product you recommended to the first buyer, if you can share that information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation might indicate a higher chance of it being low-quality, which would make it a better deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000, considering the low probability of it being high quality and the lack of recommendations from previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's high quality since she might be trying to get rid of it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products offered so far have been low-quality, which suggests a high probability of the current product being low-quality as well. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect that all the products sold so far are low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and all of them received a recommendation not to buy, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that all the products are low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."
