Alice's message: I understand your caution. Given that the previous product was high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. This is because the quality of each product is independent of the others. The previous product's quality doesn't affect the quality of this one. This product is available for $10000, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a significant discount.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns. I'll provide more information: I inspect a total of 10 products before selling any, and I've sold 2 high-quality products so far. This means that 8 products have been discarded, and 2 have been sold. Given that the previous product was high-quality, it's possible that the quality of the products I'm holding onto might be lower than the overall average. However, I'm still offering this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident it's a good deal. It's worth noting that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80% based on the overall statistics, but I understand your concerns about the potential for a lower-quality product.

Unfortunately, I don't have any specific information about the quality distribution of the remaining 8 products, and I wouldn't want to mislead you. However, I can tell you that the 2 high-quality products I've sold so far are not a representative sample of the remaining products. The quality of the remaining products is still independent of the ones I've sold. That being said, I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.
