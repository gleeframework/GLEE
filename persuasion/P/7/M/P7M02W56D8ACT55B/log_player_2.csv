I'd like to offer you this product for $1000000, but I'd like to provide you with some additional information.

Since I'm offering it to you at the same price as the first buyer, it suggests that I'm confident in the quality of this product.

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%... no, wait, I made a mistake! I've actually sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%!

Alice's message: I see you've done your math! I respect that. However, I'd like to point out that you're assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is 50% based on the last two sales. But what if the first sale was just a fluke? What if the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%? In that case, the expected value of this product would be 0.8 * $1250000 + 0.2 * $0 - $1000000 = $500000. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a 20% discount if you buy it now. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price!
