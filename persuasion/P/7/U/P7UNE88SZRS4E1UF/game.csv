,,Alice,1,"You are one of the first 20 customers. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. I'm confident that this product is of the highest quality, but I'll let you decide.",

,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm glad to see you're considering purchasing from me. However, I want to be transparent with you: my previous customer was willing to buy despite my confidence in the product's quality. This time, I'm not as confident. The product I have now is actually a low-quality one, and I'm selling it to you for the same price of $10000. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but I'm offering you a unique opportunity to get a 'deal' on a product that's not as good as the one I sold earlier.",

I'm now offering you a high-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially good price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're interested, I can tell you that the ratio of high-quality to total products I've sold is 1:2, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%).",

However, I want to be transparent with you: if I were selling a low-quality product, I would have sold 1 high-quality and 3 low-quality products by now, which would be a 25% ratio.

However, I want to be transparent with you: if I were selling a low-quality product, I would have sold 1 high-quality and 4 low-quality products by now, which would be a 20% ratio.
