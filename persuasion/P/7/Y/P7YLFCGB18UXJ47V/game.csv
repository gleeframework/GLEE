,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and the lack of previous sales data makes it a 50/50 chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer has a different experience."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on it as well."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me? I've noticed that none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products, which might suggest that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. Am I correct in assuming that your recommendation is based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far?"

Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, and considering the high probability of low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that this product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
