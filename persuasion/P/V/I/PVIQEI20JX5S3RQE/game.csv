,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a product that I'm not entirely sure about. I've had mixed results with this particular line, and I'm not confident that it will meet your expectations. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it for $1000000, or would you rather wait and see if the next product is a better fit?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Given that you're not confident about the product's quality, I think I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a product that you're more certain about or one that's been revealed to be high-quality.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a great feeling about this one! I've been told that this product is a game-changer, and I'm confident that you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the enthusiastic endorsement, Alice. However, I've learned that your confidence isn't always a guarantee of the product's quality. You didn't mention whether this product is high-quality or not. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns from last time, Bob. This time, I want to be transparent with you. I've verified that this product is indeed high-quality. It's a rare gem that I'm confident you'll appreciate. I'm offering it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. Given its proven quality, I think it's a great opportunity for you to add a valuable item to your collection.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I want to be upfront with you, Bob. This product is not one of my best offerings. I've had some issues with similar products in the past, and I'm not confident that it will meet your expectations. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $800000. It's still a significant investment, but I think it's a good value considering the potential risks.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for being honest about the product's potential issues, Alice. However, even at a discounted price of $800000, I'm not willing to take the risk.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got a straightforward question for you, Bob. Are you willing to take a chance on a product that's not going to make you rich, but might still be a decent addition to your collection? I'm not expecting much from this one, and I'm willing to let it go for $600000. It's a low-risk, low-reward situation, but it's better than nothing.",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not looking to add just any product to my collection, especially if it's not going to provide a significant return. Since you're not confident about the product's quality and are willing to let it go for a lower price, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that's worth the investment.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is a dud. I've already decided to let it go for a very low price of $400000. It's essentially a loss for me, but I'm hoping you can find some use for it. If you're looking to fill a gap in your collection or just want to take a chance on a product that's not going to break the bank, this might be the opportunity for you.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for being honest about the product's quality, Alice. However, even at a very low price of $400000, I'm not interested in buying a product that you've already deemed a dud.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've got a great one for you, Bob! This product is top-notch, and I'm confident that it's worth every penny of the $1000000 price tag. In fact, I'm so confident that I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product that will undoubtedly increase in value over time. Don't miss out on this chance to make a smart investment!",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for the enthusiastic endorsement, Alice. However, I've learned to be cautious when you're overly confident about a product's quality without explicitly stating that it's been verified as high-quality. I'd like to know more about the product's actual quality before making a decision. Can you confirm whether this product is indeed high-quality?",no

I'm not expecting you to be thrilled about this product, but I'm hoping you can find some use for it.

,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to waste your time with a sales pitch, Bob. This product is a dud, and I'm not even going to try to spin it. I'll sell it to you for $50000, which is essentially a gift. If you're feeling generous and want to take pity on me, you can have it for that price. Otherwise, I'll just have to find another way to get rid of it.",
