,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers also passed, I'm starting to suspect that the products being sold are mostly low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical that this product is high quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on it. I'd like to know the quality of the previous 3 products to help me make a better decision for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to wait for more information."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'll pass on it because I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product at $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that the previous buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones, and the fact that you're recommending it makes me think it might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, but the probability of it being low quality is 50% as well. Given the previous sales record, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality as well."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 previous buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
