I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to ask, are you willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, or would you like to wait and see if I can break the streak?""

I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row might indicate that I'm running low on high-quality stock. I'm willing to offer you a 'break the streak' deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a special discount on the next product you buy from me. However, if it's low-quality, the price remains the same at $10000.""

I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me. If it's low-quality, the price remains the same at $10000. This is my last chance to redeem myself, and I'm willing to make a strong offer to convince you to take the risk.""

However, I'd like to point out that this is the first high-quality product I've sold in 5 attempts. Given this information, I'd like to ask you to reconsider the probability of a product being high-quality. Is it still 33.33%, or has my track record changed your perception? I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'd like to gauge your updated expectations.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' lack of success is representative of the product's quality. Given the limited data, I'd like to stick with my original probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product. However, I appreciate the 20% discount offer. Can I get an additional 10% discount on top of that, and I'll consider purchasing the product?

Unfortunately, I've now sold 6 low-quality products in a row, and the probability of a high-quality product seems to be dwindling.

However, I want to be upfront with you - the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I have in stock.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, and I appreciate the 30% discount on the next product. I'd like to clarify, though, that my decision is not based on any change in the probability of a high-quality product, but rather on the potential long-term benefits of buying from you.

I'm willing to make a final offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 40% discount on the next product you buy from me. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal.

I'm willing to make a 'last-ditch' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me. If it's high-quality, you'll get an incredible deal.

I've sold 9 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my initial stock of high-quality products may have been depleted. However, I want to provide you with some context: out of 10 products sold, 1 has been high-quality. This means that 10% of my products have been high-quality, which is actually slightly higher than the initial 33.33% probability I mentioned. I'm willing to offer you a'reality check' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 60% discount on the next product you buy from me. If it's high-quality, you'll get an amazing deal. If it's low-quality, you'll at least get a significant discount. I want to be transparent with you about my sales record and give you a chance to make an informed decision.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm concerned that the 1 high-quality product out of 10 might be a fluke. Given the low-quality products you've sold so far, I'd like to buy the current product and take advantage of the 60% discount on the next one. But I'd like to propose a slight modification to the deal: can you guarantee that the next product will be sold at the discounted price regardless of its quality?

I'm willing to offer you a compromise: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 60% discount on the next product you buy from me, but only if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, the price will be the standard $10000. I want to make it clear that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm not trying to deceive you.
