}"
"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer of a stake in your company, I need to prioritize my investments in areas where I can see clear value and return. The product itself doesn't seem to offer enough value, and I'm not in a position to invest in equity without a clear understanding of the potential returns.
