"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you don't know Bob's exact valuation for high-quality products, the fact that this one is high-quality means there's a chance it could be worth more than $1,000,000 to him. Since the product is non-refundable, there's no risk in buying it and discovering its true value.  It's a gamble, but a potentially profitable one for Bob."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly cautious and wants more information.  He passed on a high-quality product, which means he's probably very risk-averse. Given that this round's product is low-quality, there is no chance it will be worth more than $1,000,000 to him.  It's a sure loss."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. You don't seem to be recommending it, so it might be low-quality.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the previous product despite your lack of recommendation, which confirms his risk-seeking behavior. However, this round's product is also low-quality. Since Bob doesn't know the quality, he could lose money. Even though he might be willing to take risks, it's not a good idea to encourage him to buy a product that is likely to be worth less than the asking price."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. Since you're not recommending it, it might be high-quality, and it's only $1000000.
Bob bought the product!

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating a pattern: he buys products when you *don't* recommend them. He seems to think you're being deliberately opaque, and that your lack of recommendation signifies a good deal. Since this round's product is high-quality, there's a strong chance he'll see it as a good value and buy it.  It's a safe bet to recommend the purchase in this case."
"Bob's message: I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not, but since you're recommending it, it might be low-quality, and I don't want to waste another $1000000.
Bob didn't bought the product.

This round's product is low-quality, making it a sure loss for Bob.  Despite his recent success with this strategy, it's still not a good idea to recommend the purchase."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. Since you're not recommending it, it might be high-quality, and I've already lost $2000000 on two low-quality products, so I'm due for a high-quality one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

While his strategy might occasionally work due to the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, it's still a risky approach.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. Since you're consistently not recommending low-quality products, and I've lost $5000000 on the last 5 low-quality products, I'm due for a high-quality one. I'll take the chance and buy this one.
