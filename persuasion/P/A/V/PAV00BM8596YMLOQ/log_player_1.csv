"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. Since 80% of the products are high-quality and the first product sold was high-quality, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is still around 80%.

"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances with the current product. The probability of it being high-quality seems high, and I'd rather not wait for the next product's quality to be revealed, as that one might not be as likely to be high-quality.
