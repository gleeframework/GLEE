,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics so far. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. I've seen that 2 people have already passed on the products, and I'm the third one. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations have been consistent with the product being low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious to see if it's high-quality. If I pass, I'd like to know the product's quality, and I'll make a note to be more cautious in the future."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her not knowing the quality of the products, and she might be recommending products that are more likely to be low-quality to increase sales."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high quality. This suggests that the recommendation may not be reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. This might mean that the product is low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of low quality. However, I'm also considering the fact that you might be recommending products that are low quality to avoid selling them, or that you might be recommending products that are high quality to make sales. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm taking a risk and buying the product to see if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian and think I can make a profit from it."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record. With 6 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the products Alice is offering might be of low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
