Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Welcome! I want to give you a clear picture of my sales history so far. I've sold one product, which was of low quality. I've also had 19 other opportunities to sell products, four of which were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of those sales were made. This means that I still haven't sold a high-quality product, and my overall sales record is not reassuring. In fact, I've had a streak of 19 consecutive buyers decline to purchase after the first sale, and my sales history doesn't provide any evidence to support the idea that my products are likely to be high-quality. At this point, I'm willing to admit that my sales strategy has not been effective, and I'm not sure if I can provide any value to you as a buyer. This new product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, just like any other, but I want to caution you that the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is real. It's priced at $1,000,000, and I want to highlight that the potential loss could be significant. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product based on my sales history. However, I want to give you all the information and let you make your own decision. Make your decision based on this information, and I appreciate your consideration.""}"
