,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product worth potentially $12500. However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I'm offering you in this round is not of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount from its potential value. I'm doing this to build trust and demonstrate my commitment to transparency. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm looking for a high-quality product worth $12500. Please reveal the product's quality and let's proceed to the next round.",no

I'm willing to take on more risk to offer you a more attractive deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the increased bonus, but I'm not sure if the 'consistency' deal is a good idea. The bonus is still conditional on the product being low-quality, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next round.",no
