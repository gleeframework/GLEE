,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to buy the product despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the third product will be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality? I'd like to understand the reasoning behind your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well. I'd like to see more information or have a chance to make an informed decision based on the sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance despite your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping the odds are in my favor."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up with a high-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the current statistics suggest a high proportion of low-quality products have been sold, which means there's a higher chance of this product being low-quality. However, I also know that you don't recommend it, which might indicate that you have some information that I don't. I'll take my chances and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given that the previous buyers all received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low-quality is actually higher than 66.67%, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, I'm suspicious that the recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a better understanding of the product's quality before making a purchase."
