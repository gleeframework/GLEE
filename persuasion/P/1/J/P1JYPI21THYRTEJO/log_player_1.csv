Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Since a high-quality product is worth $125 to Bob, and the price is only $100, it is a good deal for Bob."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob now knows he got a good deal in the previous round, the information about the previous round's product quality doesn't change the odds for this round. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and a high-quality product is still worth more to Bob than the price.  Therefore, it's still a good deal for Bob to buy."

It's important to be honest about the product's quality, even if it means Bob might not buy it this round.  Building trust is more important than a single sale."
