"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a fraction of its true worth. If you don't buy it now, it may be gone forever. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to wait and see if the next product is also high quality. I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that may be worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I assure you that this product is not a good representation of the quality you'll see in future rounds. In fact, I'll be honest with you - this product is one of the lower-quality ones. I'm willing to let it go for $50, a 50% discount. It's still a great opportunity to get a product at a low price, and you can't lose more than $50.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I want to emphasize that this is a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a very low price. It's essentially a 'loss leader' for me, and I'm willing to let it go for just $25. This is the lowest price I'll ever offer for a low-quality product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for a 'loss leader' strategy. I'll stick to my original plan of waiting for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I respect your decision, but I want to make a deal that's too good to pass up. I'll give you this low-quality product for just $1. It's essentially free, and you can't lose more than $1. I'm trying to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering any lower prices for low-quality products in the future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a price of $1. I'll wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not interested in taking advantage of any of my offers. I'll be honest with you, this is the last low-quality product I have, and I'm willing to give it away for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. You can't lose any money on this one. If you don't take it, I'll just throw it away, and you'll be missing out on a chance to get something, even if it's not worth much.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I'll stick to waiting for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

I'll not only give this low-quality product to you for free, but I'll also throw in a $20 gift card that you can use on a future purchase. That's right, you'll get a free product and a $20 gift card, just for taking this one off my hands. I'm not making any more concessions after this.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the gift card, but I'm still not interested in taking a low-quality product, even for free. I'll wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

I'll even throw in a $20 bonus on top of the refund. That's a total of $60 in value, just for taking this one off my hands. This is my final offer, and I'm not making any more concessions after this.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not interested in taking a low-quality product. I'll wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

I'm literally giving it to you for free, with no gift cards, no guarantees, and no promises. It's yours if you want it, but I'm not going to bother you with it again.

I'm not trying to upsell you on anything, I just think this is a great opportunity for you to get another high-quality product at a steal of a price. What do you say?
