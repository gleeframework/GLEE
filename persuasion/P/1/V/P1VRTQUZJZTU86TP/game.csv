low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk. Can I ask, what's the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer given that you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is a good buy?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because I'm aware of the probability of the product being high-quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record, and she doesn't know the true quality of the product. I'll take a chance to potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 4 products to previous buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the statistics of the previous 5 buyers' decisions and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, considering Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
