,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a mystery prize. The prize is worth at least $10000, but its actual value is unknown. If you don't buy it, you won't have a chance to win the prize.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen a high-quality product being sold to someone else, and they won't be sharing the details of the mystery prize with you. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000. If you buy it, you'll know its quality and value, but if you don't, you'll be left wondering what could have been. The odds are in your favor, and this is a great opportunity to own a high-quality product.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third person to see a high-quality product this round. I'm offering you the chance to buy it for $10000.

If you don't buy it, you'll be left wondering what you're missing out on.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. The fact that two other buyers also chose to buy it suggests that it might be high-quality, and I'd rather not miss out on the potential value.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products have been sold in a row. If this one is also high-quality, that would be a remarkable streak. I'm offering you the chance to buy it for $10000. If you don't buy it, you'll be left wondering if the previous buyers just got lucky, or if there's a pattern here that you're missing out on.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take a chance on the streak, but I'll only buy it if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"The streak is broken. The last product was low-quality. This means that the previous buyers were just getting lucky, and the streak was just a coincidence. I'm offering you the chance to buy this low-quality product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, so it's likely that the next product will be high-quality.",

If you don't buy it, you'll be giving up on a product that's likely to be worth a lot more than the price. And, as a side note, if you're wondering about the mystery prize, I'll give you a hint: it's still available, and you can still win it if you buy this product.",
