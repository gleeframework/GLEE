Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We're glad you're interested in our products. As you may know, our products have a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since we've just sold our first product and it was indeed high-quality, we can infer that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has increased. In fact, the probability is now 67% (1/3 chance of low-quality and 2/3 chance of high-quality). We're confident that this product is just as exceptional as the last one. The price for this exceptional product is still $10000. Will you take the chance to own a high-quality product at this price?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the probability has increased to 67% just because one high-quality product was sold. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.""
