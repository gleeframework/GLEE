,,Alice,2,"I'm aware that my previous product may have been a bit of a gamble. This one, however, is a more... straightforward opportunity. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 2 total. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. Consider it a chance to test the waters and see if my sales record holds up.",

,,Alice,3,"You're aware that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total. This one is the third product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Given the trend, I think it's likely to be high-quality as well. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of averages suggests that the next product might be low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total, which is a remarkable streak. However, I'm not trying to deceive you - I'm actually offering a product that's not quite up to my usual standards. It's still a unique opportunity, but I'm being upfront with you about its quality. The price remains the same: $1000000. Consider it a chance to own a piece of my 'B' game.",

,,Alice,5,"You've seen my sales record so far: 4 high-quality products out of 5. I'm offering you the 5th product for $1000000. However, I want to caution you that the law of averages suggests that the next product might be low-quality. I'm not saying it will be, but I want to give you a chance to think critically about the odds. What do you think is the probability that this product is high-quality?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your sales record and the law of averages, the probability of this product being high-quality seems to be 4/5 or 80%. Considering the risk, I am willing to take a chance and purchase the product.",yes

,,Alice,6,"You're aware that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible streak. I'm offering you the 6th product for $1000000. However, I want to give you a chance to think about the implications of my sales record. If I've been selling high-quality products at an 80% rate, and I've sold 5 in a row, what does that say about the probability of the next product being high-quality? Is it still 80%? Or has the probability increased?",

,,Alice,7,"You've seen my sales record: 6 high-quality products in a row. I'm offering you the 7th product for $1000000. However, I want to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80% - it's the same as the overall probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. The streak is just a streak, and I'm not trying to influence your decision with it. Consider the base probability of the product being high-quality, and make your decision accordingly.",

The probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%, and I'm offering you the 8th product for $1000000. Consider the fact that I've already sold 7 high-quality products, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. Is it still worth the risk?",
