"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendations are not guaranteed to be accurate, it's best to treat this as a gamble. There's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. It's a gamble with even odds, and you have nothing to lose since you have no prior information to work with."
