low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, so I'll take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to make my decision. Is it possible to share that information?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this one as well. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have not bought the product, and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and how many total products were sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not buying. Your recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in the product's quality.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. The probability of this being a low-quality product is high, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that is worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is very low. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on the product. However, I'm also aware that Alice doesn't know the true value of the product to me, so I'm not entirely convinced by her recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, because Alice's previous recommendations were all negative, which means she has seen 4 low-quality products in a row. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% because the observed proportion of low-quality products is lower than the true probability. Therefore, I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality sales. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up purchasing the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, so I'd rather play it safe and pass."
