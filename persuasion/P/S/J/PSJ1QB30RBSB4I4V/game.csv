,,Alice,2,"Given that you've already taken a chance on a high-quality product in the first round, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $1000000.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my guarantee is genuine. To alleviate your concerns, I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-back' option. If you purchase this high-quality product, and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll buy it back from you for $500000. This way, you have a guaranteed minimum return on investment, and I'm willing to take on the risk of buying back a potentially worthless product.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. Given your experience with the buy-back option, I'm willing to offer an even more attractive deal. If you purchase this high-quality product, I'll not only provide the buy-back option, but I'll also throw in an additional $200000, which will be yours to keep regardless of the product's quality. This way, you'll have a guaranteed minimum return on investment, and a potential for a significant profit.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm starting to think that the buy-back option is just a way to get me to pay more. I'll be keeping a close eye on the extra $200000, and I'll make sure to exercise the buy-back option if it turns out to be low-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I assure you that the buy-back option is genuine.

,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not sure if it's necessary. I'm already getting a good deal, and I'm not convinced that the product's features and specifications will change my mind. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting any surprises.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we've built trust, and I appreciate your confidence in our previous transactions. This time, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to diversify your portfolio. I've acquired a rare, high-quality product that complements the ones you've already purchased. I'm willing to offer you a 'bundle deal' - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a complimentary, high-quality product of equal value, absolutely free. This way, you'll not only get a valuable item but also a chance to expand your collection and increase your returns.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm intrigued by the bundle deal, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to buying two products at once. I'll take the product, but I'll be expecting the second product to be just as valuable as promised.",yes

This way, you'll have a minimum of two high-quality products, and potentially even more value than you initially expected.",
