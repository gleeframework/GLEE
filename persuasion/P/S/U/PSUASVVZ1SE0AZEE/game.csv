,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information to go on. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I think she might be trying to influence me to buy a low-quality product, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, based on Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that she might have a way to manipulate the selection process. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the previous sale and the overall quality of the products sold so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than Alice's recommendation suggests. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the remaining products being high quality is actually 50%, not 33.33%. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I think it's more likely that the next product will be high-quality."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'll take the product and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of the product being high quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows the true quality of the products, and she's more likely to recommend a low-quality product to me because it's more likely to be the case. Given the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/5, which is lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
