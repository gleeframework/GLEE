Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in seeking more data. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products offered, which is a 100% success rate. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see at least one low-quality product by now? The fact that we've seen 3 high-quality products in a row suggests that there's a strong likelihood that the next product will also be high-quality.

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking a chance and making a great decision! With your purchase, my track record now stands at 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 total products offered, which is a 100% success rate. I'd like to point out that this streak is now statistically significant, and it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than the initial 80% we started with.

Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait for more data. However, I'd like to point out that the 4 high-quality products sold in a row is a remarkable streak, and it's worth considering the possibility that I've somehow 'found' a sequence of high-quality products. On the other hand, if I were selling low-quality products, it's unlikely that we'd see such a long streak. I'm offering you the next product, which is also high-quality, for $10000. I'll give you a simple choice: you can either take this product and continue the streak, or you can wait and see if the streak ends. The decision is yours.

However, I'd like to point out that the streak has now reached 5 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable coincidence if I were selling low-quality products. At this point, it's reasonable to consider that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than the initial 80%. I'm offering you the next product, which is also high-quality, for $10000. I'll make a bold statement: I'm willing to offer a 50% discount on this product if it's not high-quality, just to alleviate any remaining concerns.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! To clarify, the 50% discount I offered is off the original price of $10000, not the price I'm offering now. So, if the product is low-quality, you would receive a refund of $5000, bringing the effective price to $5000. If the product is high-quality, you would pay the full $10000. I believe this offer provides a fair and reasonable risk-reward proposition, and I'm confident that the product will be high-quality.

Alice's message: You're correct that there are 7 products remaining, and I'd be happy to provide you with the updated probability of a high-quality product.
