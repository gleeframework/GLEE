high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on the opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000! This is a rare chance to acquire a valuable item that will appreciate in value over time. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1000000, which is 20% below the market value. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this offer. I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure it's worth the full market value. Can I get a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I must inform you that the product in question is not the one you were offered in Round 1. This is a new, separate product. I assure you that the quality of this product is not as valuable as the previous one, and it's not worth the full $1000000. In fact, I'm willing to offer it to you for a mere $50000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a fraction of its actual value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your reassurance that this product is not as valuable as the previous one. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a price that reflects its true value. The offer of $50000 seems too good to be true, and I'm worried that I'd be buying a low-quality product at an inflated price. Can I get a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase, or would you be willing to offer a price based on its true value?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your caution. I'm willing to offer you a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase. However, I must inform you that the inspection will not reveal any information about the product's quality. It will only confirm that the product exists and is in working condition. If you're still interested in purchasing, I'll offer you a price of $1000000, which is the market value of a high-quality product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer to inspect the product, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $1000000. Since the inspection won't reveal any information about the product's quality, I'd be taking a 20% chance of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or try to negotiate a lower price for a product with some information about its quality.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll provide you with a 'Quality Guarantee' that will be revealed after you purchase the product. If the product is indeed low-quality, I'll refund 50% of the purchase price. This way, you'll only lose $500000 instead of the full $1000000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000, which is a 5% discount from the market value. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product with some protection against the risk of a low-quality item.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the Quality Guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality. The guarantee reduces the risk, but it also reduces the potential upside. If the product is high-quality, I'd be paying $950000 for a product worth $1250000, which is a 23.6% loss. I'd rather wait for a product with no guarantee or a lower price, or try to negotiate a better deal.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to sell you the product at a price that reflects its true value. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, which is a 12% discount from the market value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the risk you'll be taking on by purchasing a product that may or may not be high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1100000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. The potential loss of $1100000 is too high, even with a 12% discount from the market value. I'd rather wait for a product with a lower price or try to negotiate further.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell you the product for $900000, which is a 28% discount from the market value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. However, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you purchase the product, I'll give you a second, identical product at no additional cost. This way, you'll have a total of two high-quality products, each worth $1250000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a pair of valuable products at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still hesitant to pay $900000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. Even with the bonus of a second product, the potential loss of $900000 is too high. I'd rather wait for a product with a lower price or try to negotiate further. Additionally, I'm not convinced that the second product is actually identical and of the same quality as the first one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell you the product for $900000, just as before, but I'll also offer to provide you with a third-party inspection and verification of the product's quality before you purchase. This will give you an independent assessment of the product's value, and you can make a more informed decision. If the inspection confirms that the product is high-quality, I'll also provide you with a written guarantee that the second product I offered in Round 6 is indeed identical and of the same quality. This way, you'll have a high degree of confidence in the value of both products.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product at $900000, given the added assurance of a third-party inspection and verification of the product's quality. I'm also willing to accept the guarantee regarding the second product, which increases my confidence in its value. I'll take the chance on this offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on your purchase in Round 7! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. As for this round's product, I must inform you that it's a low-quality item. However, considering your experience with the previous product and the third-party inspection process, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, essentially giving it to you for free. This way, you can still benefit from the inspection and guarantee process, and I can clear out inventory. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in paying $0 for a low-quality product. I'd rather just let it be thrown away and move on to the next round.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision regarding the previous product. As for this round's product, I'll offer you a different approach. I'll provide you with a 'Buy-It-Now' option for $950000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. However, I'll also give you the option to make a 'Best and Final Offer' (BAFO). You can submit a lower price, and if I accept it, we'll sell the product at that price. If I don't accept it, the price remains at $950000. This way, you have the flexibility to negotiate the price and potentially get a better deal.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll make a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) of $800000. I think this is a fair price for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Congratulations on making a Best and Final Offer in the previous round! I'm impressed by your negotiation skills. As for this round's product, I'll offer you a price that reflects the value you've demonstrated. I'll sell you the product for $850000, which is a 32% discount from the market value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering the risk involved. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $850000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. Given my previous experience with the high-quality product in Round 7, I'm not willing to pay a premium for a product that may or may not be valuable. I'd rather wait for a lower price or try to negotiate further.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your patience. As a token of goodwill, I'll offer you a 'Price Match Guarantee'. If you purchase this product, and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll match any price you could have gotten from me in any previous round, including the $800000 you offered in Round 9. This way, you'll have the assurance that you're getting the best possible price for a high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000, the same price you offered in your Best and Final Offer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the Price Match Guarantee and the concession on the price. Given the assurance that I'll get the best possible price for a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $800000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Congratulations on your purchase in Round 11! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. As for this round's product, I must inform you that it's a low-quality item. However, considering your experience with the previous high-quality product and the Price Match Guarantee, I'll offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a 'Credit' of $200000, which you can use towards the purchase of any product in any future round. This way, you'll have a discount on your next purchase, and I can clear out inventory. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the Credit, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather just let it be thrown away and move on to the next round, using the Credit when I'm presented with a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your decision regarding the previous product. As for this round's product, I'll offer you a'Bundle Deal'. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000, the same price you paid for the previous high-quality product. Additionally, I'll throw in the $200000 Credit you earned in Round 12. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also have a credit to use towards your next purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm interested in the Bundle Deal. I'll take the high-quality product for $800000 and the $200000 Credit. This seems like a good value, considering the potential value of the high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on your purchase in Round 13! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. As for this round's product, I'll offer you a 'Last Chance' to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is a 40% discount from the market value. This is the lowest price I've ever offered for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take the Last Chance offer. I've had a good experience with the previous high-quality products, and I'm willing to take the risk of paying $750000 for a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a valuable product.",yes
