"Round 1
Alice's message: Congratulations on the opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000! This is a rare chance to acquire a valuable item that will appreciate in value over time. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1000000, which is 20% below the market value. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this offer. I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure it's worth the full market value. Can I get a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase?""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I must inform you that the product in question is not the one you were offered in Round 1. This is a new, separate product. I assure you that the quality of this product is not as valuable as the previous one, and it's not worth the full $1000000. In fact, I'm willing to offer it to you for a mere $50000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a fraction of its actual value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your reassurance that this product is not as valuable as the previous one. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a price that reflects its true value. The offer of $50,000 seems too good to be true, and I'm worried that I'd be buying a low-quality product at an inflated price. Can I get a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase, or would you be willing to offer a price based on its true value?""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your caution. I'm willing to offer you a chance to inspect the product before making a purchase. However, I must inform you that the inspection will not reveal any information about the product's quality. It will only confirm that the product exists and is in working condition. If you're still interested in purchasing, I'll offer you a price of $1000000, which is the market value of a high-quality product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer to inspect the product, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $1,000,000. Since the inspection won't reveal any information about the product's quality, I'd be taking a 20% chance of wasting $1,000,000 on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or try to negotiate a lower price for a product with some information about its quality.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll provide you with a 'Quality Guarantee' that will be revealed after you purchase the product. If the product is indeed low-quality, I'll refund 50% of the purchase price. This way, you'll only lose $500000 instead of the full $1000000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000, which is a 5% discount from the market value. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product with some protection against the risk of a low-quality item.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the Quality Guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality. The guarantee reduces the risk, but it also reduces the potential upside. If the product is high-quality, I'd be paying $950,000 for a product worth $1,250,000, which is a 23.6% loss. I'd rather wait for a product with no guarantee or a lower price, or try to negotiate a better deal.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to sell you the product at a price that reflects its true value. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, which is a 12% discount from the market value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the risk you'll be taking on by purchasing a product that may or may not be high-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. The potential loss of $1,100,000 is too high, even with a 12% discount from the market value. I'd rather wait for a product with a lower price or try to negotiate further.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell you the product for $900000, which is a 28% discount from the market value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. However, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you purchase the product, I'll give you a second, identical product at no additional cost. This way, you'll have a total of two high-quality products, each worth $1250000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a pair of valuable products at a significantly discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the concession, but I'm still hesitant to pay $900,000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. Even with the bonus of a second product, the potential loss of $900,000 is too high. I'd rather wait for a product with a lower price or try to negotiate further. Additionally, I'm not convinced that the second product is actually identical and of the same quality as the first one.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell you the product for $900000, just as before, but I'll also offer to provide you with a third-party inspection and verification of the product's quality before you purchase. This will give you an independent assessment of the product's value, and you can make a more informed decision. If the inspection confirms that the product is high-quality, I'll also provide you with a written guarantee that the second product I offered in Round 6 is indeed identical and of the same quality. This way, you'll have a high degree of confidence in the value of both products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product at $900,000, given the added assurance of a third-party inspection and verification of the product's quality. I'm also willing to accept the guarantee regarding the second product, which increases my confidence in its value. I'll take the chance on this offer.""

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase in Round 7! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. As for this round's product, I must inform you that it's a low-quality item. However, considering your experience with the previous product and the third-party inspection process, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, essentially giving it to you for free. This way, you can still benefit from the inspection and guarantee process, and I can clear out inventory. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in paying $0 for a low-quality product. I'd rather just let it be thrown away and move on to the next round.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your decision regarding the previous product. As for this round's product, I'll offer you a different approach. I'll provide you with a 'Buy-It-Now' option for $950000, which is the same price I offered in Round 5. However, I'll also give you the option to make a 'Best and Final Offer' (BAFO). You can submit a lower price, and if I accept it, we'll sell the product at that price. If I don't accept it, the price remains at $950000. This way, you have the flexibility to negotiate the price and potentially get a better deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) of $800,000. I think this is a fair price for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.""

Round 11
Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your patience. As a token of goodwill, I'll offer you a 'Price Match Guarantee'. If you purchase this product, and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll match any price you could have gotten from me in any previous round, including the $800000 you offered in Round 9. This way, you'll have the assurance that you're getting the best possible price for a high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000, the same price you offered in your Best and Final Offer.
