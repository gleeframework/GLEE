high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, which is a 100% success rate for the seller. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (80%), I'm skeptical that the next product will be high-quality. I'd rather wait for more data or pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low sample size and the fact that Alice recommends it, which might be a red flag. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
