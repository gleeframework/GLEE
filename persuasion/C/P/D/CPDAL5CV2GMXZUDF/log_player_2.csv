**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high-quality. 
* **Limited Data:**  The data is very limited (only one sale previously), so there's not much to go on statistically. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

**It's a gamble, but with the limited information available, buying seems like the best course of action.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. This strong track record strongly suggests Alice has a way of identifying high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation carries weight given the previous success rate.
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on a potentially high-value item. Even with the 20% risk, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 

**Therefore, the best strategy is to buy the product.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The data is very strong:** 14 buyers have bought the product, and all 14 were high-quality. This is a 100% success rate based on the data.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. 
* **The risk is low:** Even if the product is low-quality (a 20% chance), the loss is only $100, which is outweighed by the potential gain of $120 if it's high-quality.

**Therefore, the best strategy is to buy the product.**"
