low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk as I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the lack of information and the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is not based on my valuation. I'm essentially taking a gamble here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have rejected low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even with your recommendation against it. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $12000 value."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 products have been low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that 8 out of 8 products have been low quality, I'm guessing the probability is still 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because the previous products were mostly low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping that this is a low-quality product, which would be in line with her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a pattern or reason behind your recommendation?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more data to update my probability estimates."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I'm concerned that the low-quality products are being sold, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, given that none have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, based on the previous sales record, it seems that all the products sold so far were low quality, and I don't want to be the 13th buyer to take the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
