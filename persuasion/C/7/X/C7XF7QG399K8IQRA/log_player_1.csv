"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's highly likely that Bob will value the product at a price higher than $10,000.  Therefore, recommending the purchase makes sense."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob just bought a high-quality product, indicating he likely values high-quality products at a price higher than $10,000.  Since this round's product is also high-quality, it's reasonable to recommend the purchase again."
"Bob's message: Based on your previous recommendation and the value of high-quality products, I am confident in purchasing this product as well.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has bought two high-quality products in a row, there is no guarantee that he will value a low-quality product at $10,000.  It's much riskier to recommend this product. The best strategy here is to wait and see if Bob will buy the product without your recommendation. If he does, it means he may value low-quality products at $10,000 and you can adjust your strategy.  If he doesn't, it indicates he may be more cautious after discovering the quality of the last two products, and you should proceed with caution in the future rounds."
"Bob's message: Even without a recommendation, the potential value of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, so I will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob just purchased a low-quality product, indicating that he might be willing to purchase a low-quality product at $10,000. However, there's no guarantee that he'll continue this pattern.  It's still risky to recommend a low-quality product, especially after he's already experienced a low-quality product.  It's best to let Bob make his own decision this round and observe his behavior."
"Bob's message: Given Alice's lack of recommendation and the history of low-quality products when not recommended, I will pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.

```

**Explanation:**
