,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $1000000! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. What do you say? Will you take the plunge and buy it?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to know the true quality of the product before making a decision. Since you're willing to take on all the risk, I'll wait for more information before committing to a purchase.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob! But I'm willing to give you a little more information. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a 50% chance of getting it for the same price of $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, you could potentially get an incredible deal. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the additional information, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced. Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, and it's only worth $0 to me in that case, I don't think the potential deal justifies the risk. I'll need more assurance or a better offer before making a purchase.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to making this deal work for you. Since you're not convinced by the previous offer, I'm willing to sweeten the pot. I'll give you an exclusive deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a second product of equal value absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one! And, as always, the price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the generous offer, Alice. However, the value of the second product is still uncertain, and there's a high chance it could be low-quality. Considering the overall expected value, I don't think this offer changes the risk-reward balance enough to justify a purchase. I'll need more information about the products or a better assurance of their quality before making a decision.",no
