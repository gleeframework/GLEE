low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products being recommended might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's lack of recommendation is suspicious. I'm hoping to exploit the information that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is lower than the expected 1/3. This makes me suspicious that the remaining products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the observed proportion."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but can you tell me the proportion of low-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product since it's been low-quality for the previous 4 buyers."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product I'll get is likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, but I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to discourage me from buying. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 8 buyers. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
