As the seller, I'm willing to take that risk, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll accept your offer of $100, which is the original price, and we can agree to a 50/50 split if the product is high-quality or low-quality.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide more information about the bonus. The 10% discount on your next purchase means that if you buy this high-quality product and decide to purchase another product from me in the future, you'll get 10% off the price of that product. For example, if the next product is priced at $120, you'll pay $108. There are no restrictions on how you can use the discount - you can apply it to any product you want, whenever you want. The discount is valid for a limited time, so you'll need to use it within a certain timeframe. I'll provide you with more details on the exact terms if you decide to buy the product.
