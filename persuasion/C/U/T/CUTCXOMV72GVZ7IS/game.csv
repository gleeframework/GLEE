high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the opportunity. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the fair price, I am willing to make this purchase.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 1 products sold. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I should have sold at least 1 high-quality product by now. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,I trust the statistics and the probability. I'll take the chance and buy the product.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 products sold so far. This is consistent with the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a perfect track record so far, which is unusual. I'm curious to see if this streak continues.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information. Based on the statistics and your transparency, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 products sold so far. This is an unusually high streak, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling high-quality products more frequently than the 80% probability would suggest. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to warn you that I might be due for a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the heads up, Alice. I trust your honesty and am willing to take the risk. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 products sold, and then 1 low-quality product. This suggests that the 80% probability might be a bit too high, but I'm not sure. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. However, I want to ask: would you be willing to pay more than $100 if you knew for certain that this product was high-quality?",
,,the buyer,5,I trust your assessment and am willing to pay $100 for the product based on your recommendations and past sales record.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 products sold, then 1 low-quality product, and now another low-quality product. This is starting to look like a 50-50 split, which is lower than the 80% probability I claimed. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - my track record is no longer as impressive as it was.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the statistics and the value I place on high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 products sold, which is a 85.71% success rate. This is still below the 80% probability I claimed, but getting closer. However, I want to ask: would you be willing to pay a premium for this product, considering the relatively high success rate I've had so far?",
,,the buyer,7,"Given the high success rate and the premium you're asking for, I am willing to pay a premium for the product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 products sold, which is a 87.5% success rate. I'm starting to think that my initial 80% probability might have been a bit conservative. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to offer you a deal: I'll throw in a guarantee that if this product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you a refund if the next product is low-quality.",

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 9 products sold, which is a 88.89% success rate. I'm starting to think that my initial 80% probability might have been a bit too low. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've been lucky so far, and I don't want you to get burned if the next product is low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to warn you: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll be 9 for 10, and my credibility will take a hit.",

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 11 products sold, which is a 90.91% success rate. I'm starting to think that my initial 80% probability was significantly too low.
