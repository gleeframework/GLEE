Alice's message: Thanks for considering my product! You're aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%. Since you've seen that the previous buyer took a chance and bought a low-quality product, you might be wondering if the odds are still in your favor. I'll give you a hint: the quality of the product doesn't necessarily change based on the previous sales.

Alice's message: I understand your concern! Given the previous sales record, we can calculate the probability of the recent high-quality product being a fluke. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and we've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products, the probability of the second high-quality product being a fluke is actually quite high - around 22.22%! However, this doesn't change the overall probability of the next product being high-quality, which remains at 33.33%.
