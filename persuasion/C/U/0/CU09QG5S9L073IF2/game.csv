I want to assure you that my sales record is transparent, and you can see that I've sold two high-quality products in a row. However, I'd like to point out that this could be a coincidence, and the next product might be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'free' product from my next 10 sales.

I'd like to point out that the odds are now in your favor, and it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've been selling a lot of high-quality products in a row, and it's possible that I've been 'lucky' so far. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I'll also give you the same 'guarantee' as before: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'free' product from my next 10 sales. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the streak of high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product.

However, I want to point out that the odds are still in your favor, and it's likely that this product will be high-quality as well. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. With 4 high-quality products sold in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability might be higher than that.

Can you provide more information about the quality of the products that were sold before the 'free' product guarantee was introduced?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product, and I have a total of 15 products left. I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information about my sales record. Before introducing the 'free' product guarantee, I sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products. This was a 100% success rate, and I was selling products at a rate that was higher than the 80% probability. However, I want to caution you that this was just a coincidence, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's worth it.

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you will indeed get a product from my next 10 sales. However, I want to clarify that the 'free' product will be one of the next 10 products I sell, in any order. It's not a guarantee that you'll get a high-quality product, but rather a guarantee that you'll get a product from my next 10 sales, regardless of its quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's worth it. I'll also remind you that the odds are still in your favor, and it's likely that this product will be high-quality as well.",
