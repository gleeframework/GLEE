You've made similar promises before, and I'm not sure what a 'solution' or 'full refund' would look like in practice.

}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the price. While a detailed report and testimonials sound promising, I'm not sure how reliable they are. I've seen you make similar claims before, and I'm not willing to take the risk without more concrete evidence. I've observed 5 products so far, and the quality seems to be randomly distributed.

I'm willing to sell this product to you at a significantly discounted price - $500,000.

}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I've been cautious in the past, I think the significantly lower price point of $200000 changes the risk-reward calculation.
