high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I acknowledge your concerns and the fact that you've been disappointed in the past. However, I want to remind you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality was 50%.

,,Alice,10,"I understand your skepticism, and I acknowledge that the information I provided earlier wasn't sufficient to sway your decision.

With that in mind, I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $1000000. You can consider it a new, independent opportunity to acquire a high-quality product.",
