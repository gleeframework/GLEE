,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the lack of information. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk.

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
