high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the product is low-quality. I'm going to pass on it."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the lack of a recommendation from you, Alice."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm going to pass on it and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 8 products have been low quality, which is a strong indication that the current product is likely to be low quality as well. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is very low. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is also low, so I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, considering the statistics and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. Is there a pattern or a reason behind your recommendation?"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
