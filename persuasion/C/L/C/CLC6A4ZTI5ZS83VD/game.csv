high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the statistics, it's possible that Alice is recommending low-quality products to the first two buyers and reserving the high-quality ones for later. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is high-quality."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know my valuation and are trying to manipulate me. I'm hoping the product is high-quality, but I'm not getting any information from your recommendation, so I'm just going to take a chance."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I've seen that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product.
