,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Since I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered to me, which may have a higher chance of being high-quality."
