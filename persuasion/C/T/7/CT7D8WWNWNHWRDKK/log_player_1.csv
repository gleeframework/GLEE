Based on the current sales record, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 80%. This is because the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and we've already seen 2 high-quality products out of 3. I'm happy to share this information with you.

However, I followed up with them and they were satisfied with the outcome. As for issues, I'm happy to say that there were no reported issues with either of the products.

Another customer had high expectations that the product would solve a complex problem, but it was designed to address a specific issue.
