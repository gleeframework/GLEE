However, I must inform you that I've sold only 1 product so far, and I'm still building my reputation. But trust me, this one is a gem! It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $300 for a fraction of its value. Buy it now and get a great deal!",

Buy it now and take advantage of this opportunity!",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence in your products, Alice, but I'm not convinced yet. With only 2 high-quality products out of 3, I'm still concerned about the 33.33% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no

I'm starting to think that you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a guarantee. If this product is indeed high-quality, you'll get it for $100. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice. It's a risk-free deal. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait for more data. However, I'd like to point out that you're not considering the overall trend. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total, and the 2 low-quality products I've sold were in the first 2 rounds. The last 5 rounds have been high-quality, which suggests that the quality of my products is improving. I'm offering you a product for $100, and I'm confident that it's worth much more.

The consultation will be tailored to your specific needs and goals, and it's worth at least $50 on its own. But I'll throw it in for free if you buy this product. As for the product itself, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a few low-quality ones slip through the cracks, and this one is unfortunately one of them.
