high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries about the last one! I'm glad you're cautious. This one, however, is a real showstopper. I've had great feedback from previous customers, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm curious - what do you think is a fair price for a product that's exceeded expectations in the past?",
