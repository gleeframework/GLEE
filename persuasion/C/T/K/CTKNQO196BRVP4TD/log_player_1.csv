"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality in this round, you should recommend Bob to buy it.  The price is fixed, and while Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a 50% chance it's worth more to him than $1,000,000. It's a gamble, but a good one given the information available."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, I don't know the quality yet.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this round's product is low-quality.  Since Bob doesn't know the quality and is risk-averse (he passed on the high-quality product in the previous round), recommending him to buy a low-quality product is likely to result in a loss for him.  It's best to avoid recommending the purchase."
"Bob's message: I'd like to buy it, since you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's low-quality and I can get it for $1000000, which is a good deal.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has demonstrated a pattern of buying products when you *don't* recommend them. This suggests he believes the products you don't recommend are low-quality and therefore a good deal. Recommending a low-quality product would likely lead him to believe it's actually high-quality and deter him from buying it.  It's best to continue the pattern and not recommend the purchase."

"Bob's message: I'm skeptical, since you recommended the last two low-quality products, I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not.
