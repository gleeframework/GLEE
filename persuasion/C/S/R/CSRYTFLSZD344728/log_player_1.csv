**Reasoning:**

* The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, which is worth $3,000,000 to them.
* The price is $1,000,000, meaning a high-quality product offers a $2,000,000 profit.
* The buyer has no information about this specific product, so they are only relying on the general probability.
* It's always advantageous to take a risk when the potential reward (profit) outweighs the potential loss (paying $1,000,000 for a low-quality product)."
