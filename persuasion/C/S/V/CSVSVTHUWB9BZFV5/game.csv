,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a unique product at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 99% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price for this round. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I can assure you that the product is in perfect working condition and has been thoroughly inspected. I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on its specifications and features, which I'll send to you via email. Additionally, I'm willing to throw in a free consultation with one of our experts to answer any questions you may have about the product. The price remains the same, $1000000. What do you think?",
