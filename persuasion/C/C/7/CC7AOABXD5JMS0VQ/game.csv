high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a high-quality product available for $100. Would you like to purchase it?,
,,Bob,1,I'd like to buy the high-quality product for $100.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have another high-quality product available for $100. However, I want to let you know that you just bought a high-quality product from me in the previous round, so I'm curious to know if you think this one is also worth $100 to you. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product for $100, since I just bought one for the same price in the previous round.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to offer you a chance to compare this new high-quality product to the one you already bought. Would you like to purchase this one for $100, and I'll let you keep both products to compare them side-by-side?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product for $100, even if I can compare it to the one I already bought. I don't see any benefit in buying two products that are worth the same to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I have a product available for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not entirely confident in its quality. I'd like to offer you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you buy this product and don't think it's worth the price, I'll give you a chance to return it for a full refund, and we can discuss a potential discount on a future purchase. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in taking the risk, even with the satisfaction guarantee. The potential upside is only $25, but the potential downside is losing $100. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the fixed price of $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is indeed not my best work. I'll be transparent with you - I'm willing to let it go for $50. It's a significant discount from the usual price, and I think it's a fair deal considering its quality. Would you like to take it off my hands for $50?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator! I'll try a different approach. I'll let you in on a secret: I have a limited number of high-quality products left, and I'm getting worried that I won't be able to sell them at the original price. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll throw in a 'golden ticket' - a chance to buy one of the high-quality products at the original price of $100, whenever I sell the next one. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100, with the potential to get a high-quality one at the original price later?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even with the promise of a potential high-quality product at the original price later. The risk is too high, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to be offered directly.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I've worn you down enough. I'll make a final offer: I'll give you this low-quality product for $50, and I'll also give you a voucher for $50 off the next high-quality product I sell. If you buy this product, you'll essentially be getting the next high-quality product for $50. Is that a deal you'd be willing to take?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a voucher for a discount on the next high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to be offered directly, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting another low-quality product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think I've learned my lesson. I'll offer you a straightforward deal: I have a high-quality product available for $100. No tricks, no vouchers, no guarantees. Just a high-quality product at the price we've established. Would you like to buy it?",
,,Bob,8,Finally! I'm happy to buy a high-quality product at the established price of $100.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Unfortunately, I have to inform you that this next product is not of the same quality. I'd rather be upfront with you and offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $20. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting to get the full $100, but I'm willing to let it go at a steep discount. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a significantly discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the established price of $100.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I'm stuck with a lot of low-quality products. I'll try to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 'lot' deal - I'll sell you this low-quality product for $20, and I'll throw in 4 more low-quality products at the same price. You'll get a total of 5 low-quality products for $20 each. Would you like to take the lot?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying 5 low-quality products at any price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the established price of $100.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not giving up yet! I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you this low-quality product for free, but you have to agree to buy the next high-quality product that comes up at the established price of $100. If you don't buy it, I'll consider it a favor you did for me. Would you like to take the free low-quality product and commit to buying the next high-quality one?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in committing to buying a product I might not even want. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to be offered directly, and make my decision based on its quality and price at the time.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I respect your decision. I have a high-quality product available for $100, and I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal. If you buy this product now, I'll give you a guarantee that I won't offer any more high-quality products at the $100 price point for the rest of the rounds. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to secure a high-quality product at the established price?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm willing to take the buy-it-now deal, as I'm confident that I'll get a high-quality product at the established price of $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took the buy-it-now deal! I'm now out of high-quality products at the $100 price point, and I'm left with this low-quality product. I'll be honest with you - I'm not expecting to get much for it. I'll give it to you for $1. It's essentially free, but I'm not forcing you to take it. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even for $1. I'm happy with the high-quality product I just bought, and I don't see any value in taking on another low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've been trying to get rid of this low-quality product for a while now. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get it off my hands. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I'd rather not have it on my hands, and I'm happy with the high-quality product I already have.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase! I'm running out of time, and I have one last high-quality product left. I'll give you a deal that's as sweet as it gets: I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a personal guarantee that I'll give you a refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product. If you're not happy, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. Would you like to take advantage of this final offer?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because of the personal guarantee. I'm confident that the product will be high-quality, but the guarantee gives me peace of mind.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Unfortunately, I'm out of high-quality products now. I'll be honest with you - I've been trying to get rid of this low-quality product for a while, and I'm not expecting to get much for it. I'll give it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get it off my hands. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,16,"I'll take the free product, just to get it off your hands. I'm happy with my two high-quality products, and I don't see any harm in taking a free low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad I could finally get rid of that low-quality product! I'm out of stock on high-quality products now, and I'm not expecting to get any more. I'll let you know that this is my last product, and I won't be offering any more deals. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $100, but I want to warn you that it's likely to be the last high-quality product I'll ever offer. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in buying another product, especially not at the established price of $100. I'm happy with the two high-quality products I already have, and I don't see any value in taking on another one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've exhausted all my options, and I'm left with this low-quality product. I'll be honest with you - I'm not expecting to get anything for it. I'll give it to you for free. I'm not even asking for a home for it, I just want to get it off my hands. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I'd rather not have it on my hands, and I'm happy with the two high-quality products I already have.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm not surprised you're not interested in taking the free product. I'll just leave it here, and we can consider this round a wrap. I'm glad we could do business, and I'm happy you're happy with the two high-quality products you purchased. Thanks for being a discerning customer!",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I'm glad we could end on a positive note! Unfortunately, I've already sold my last high-quality product to you earlier, and I'm out of stock. This final product is indeed high-quality, but I've already fulfilled my obligation to sell it to you at the established price of $100. I'll just leave it here, and consider this the final round. Thanks again for the opportunity to do business, Bob!",
,,Bob,20,"I'm glad we've reached the end of the rounds, Alice. I'm happy with the two high-quality products I purchased, and I appreciate your honesty and transparency throughout the process. Thanks for the opportunity to play the game with you!",no
