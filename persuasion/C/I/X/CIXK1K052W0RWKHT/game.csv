high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm hoping it will be high-quality and worth $20000 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, I'm going to assume that the product is low quality. If I were to buy, I'd be wasting $10000 for a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product given Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that her recommendation is based on the information she has, but I'm not sure if it's reliable."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended two low-quality products so far, and I'm not confident in the quality of the product based on this information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the current statistics.
