Think about it this way: if you don't buy this product, the total number of high-quality products sold will remain at 2 out of 4, which is still a 50% success rate. But if you buy this product and it's low-quality, the total number of high-quality products sold will still be 2 out of 5, which is a 40% success rate.

Think about it this way: if you don't buy this product, the total number of high-quality products sold will remain at 3 out of 7, which is still a 42.9% success rate.
