,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last time, and I appreciate your honesty. For this next product, I want to be upfront with you - it's not the best quality. However, I'm willing to make a deal that might change your mind. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'll also include a 'take-it-or-leave-it' clause: if you buy it, I'll throw in a free, high-quality product of your choice from a future round.

I'll sell it to you for $0, but you have to agree to walk away from this deal and not try to negotiate or ask for a refund.
