Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could be worth $3000000 to you. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one might be the exception. It's a one-time chance to potentially score a huge deal. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it for $1000000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since there's no sales record to rely on, and given that there's an equal chance of the product being high or low quality, I'll have to pass on this one. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high without any evidence of the product's quality.""}"

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. As you know, there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and worth $3000000 to you. However, I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm offering you a chance to buy it for $1000000. It's a risk, but it's also a potential game-changer. What do you say?

However, I want to highlight that the first product I sold was indeed high-quality, and the second product was not. This might indicate that I'm not just cherry-picking high-quality products, but rather, there's a genuine chance that each product could be high-quality.
