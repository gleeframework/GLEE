I'm not trying to hide anything, but I want to make sure you're aware of the statistics. It's possible that the first two products were just a hot streak, and the next one might not be as valuable.

,,Alice,5,"I've sold four products now, and I'm starting to see a pattern. It seems I have a knack for identifying high-quality items. But let's not get ahead of ourselves - I've also had two low-quality products slip through the cracks. To mitigate this risk, I'm offering a 'buyer's choice' option: you can either buy the product for $10000, or you can choose to wait and observe my next sale. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get to buy it for $10000. If it's low-quality, you'll get to buy this one for $5000. The choice is yours.",

However, I want to be upfront with you: my sales record is now 3 high-quality out of 5 products. That's a 60% success rate, which is... not great. But I'm still confident that this product is a great value. I'm willing to make a bet with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 discount on the next product you buy from me. That's a $5000 risk for a potential $5000 reward. What do you say?",

That's not great, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not cut out for this. But I'm still here, and I'm still offering a great product. I'll give you a simple message: I'm not getting any younger, and I need to sell this product. It's a great deal, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'll throw in a free 'product inspection' - I'll let you inspect the product before you buy it, and if you're not satisfied, you can walk away. That's a $10000 product for $10000, with no risk.",
