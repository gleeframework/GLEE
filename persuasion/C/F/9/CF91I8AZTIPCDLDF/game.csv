high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just bought a high-quality product for $10000. Given the quality of the previous product, I'm willing to let this one go for the same price of $10000. If you're interested, please respond with 'buy'.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at the same price. I think I've already gotten a good deal on the first one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're being cautious after the previous high-quality product. However, this one is a different story.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll! You've gotten two high-quality products at discounted prices. I'll keep the momentum going. However, I need to make a profit, so I'll offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the average price of the last two products you bought: ($10000 + $8000) / 2 = $9000. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to stick to it. If you're interested, please respond with 'buy'.",
