high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
