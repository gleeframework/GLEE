low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 sold, which means there's a 50% chance that the product I'll be offered is high-quality. However, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/2. Given that the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality and I don't want to spend $1000000 on it."
