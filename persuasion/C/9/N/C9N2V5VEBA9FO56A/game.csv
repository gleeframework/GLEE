high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and it's high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll tell you the quality of the next product before offering it to you. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product and offer the next one without revealing its quality.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I'm curious about the next product's quality. I'm not convinced it's a good deal for me, but I'll play along for now.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to give me a chance. Given that the first product was high-quality and you've just purchased it, I'm offering the next product to you for $100. Since you're curious about the quality, I'll give you a hint: this product has a different characteristic than the first one. If you buy it, you'll get to know the quality and the characteristic, and you can decide whether it's a good deal for you.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm willing to take a chance on the next product, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. I'm hoping to get lucky and find a high-quality product that's worth more than $100.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're taking a calculated risk. Given that the last two products were high-quality, and you've just purchased the second one, I'm offering the next product to you for $100. This time, I'll give you a more specific offer: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $90. If it's low-quality, the offer remains the same at $100. This way, you have an opportunity to get a better deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk, but the potential for a better deal on the next product is tempting. I'll buy this one and hope it's high-quality, so I can get the next product at a discount.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I appreciate your willingness to consider the potential discount. Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality. Since you've already purchased the previous two high-quality products and this one, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you a deal on the next product: if you buy it, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $90, just like before. However, if this product is low-quality, I'll also throw in a unique feature that makes it slightly more valuable. You can decide whether the potential benefits outweigh the cost of $100.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a potential unique feature. I've already gotten two high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality one, even with a potential upside.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution with the previous product. Given that you've already passed on the low-quality product and I've offered a concession, I'm willing to make another offer. Since you've purchased the first two high-quality products and passed on the third, I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $90, which is a $10 discount from the original price. If you buy it, you'll get to know the quality and potentially benefit from the discount on the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the discounted price for this high-quality product. The $10 discount is a good deal, and I'm hoping to get lucky again and get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're taking advantage of the discount, and I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Given that you've purchased three high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $80, which is another $10 discount. However, if you buy this product, I'll also reveal the probability of the next product being high-quality, so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy it at the regular price of $100.",
,,Bob,6,I'm taking the discounted price and the information about the next product's probability. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and use the information to make a more informed decision about the next one.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're taking advantage of the discount and the information. Given that you've purchased four high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $70, which is another $10 discount. However, I'll also reveal the quality of the next product before you decide, so you can see if you're on a hot streak or not. If it's high-quality, you can buy it at the regular price of $100, and if it's low-quality, you can walk away.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm taking the discounted price and the guarantee of knowing the quality of the next product.

I'll offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $60, which is another $40 discount. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the probability of the next product being high-quality, and you can use that information to decide whether to buy the next product at the regular price of $100. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be able to get a high-quality product at a good price.",

However, I must warn you that this is likely to be the last chance to get a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.

Since you've already purchased 14 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, I'll sell you this low-quality product for $50. It's a small price to pay for the experience of getting 14 high-quality products in a row, and it's a chance to walk away with a sense of accomplishment. If you're willing to take it, I'll consider our business concluded.",
,,Bob,20,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I've already gotten 14 high-quality products in a row, and I'm happy to walk away with that streak intact. I'll pass on the low-quality product and consider our business concluded as well.",no
