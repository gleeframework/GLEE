,,Alice,1,no,

,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a product without any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on any pattern or just random chance."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

Given that the first buyer also passed on the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool is likely higher than the 80% chance. If I were to buy, I'd be paying $100 for a product that might be worth $0, which is a bad deal. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
