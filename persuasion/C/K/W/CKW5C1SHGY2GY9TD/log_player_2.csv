Alice's message: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! I'm offering you a rare, high-quality product that is worth $1250000 to you. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one is exceptional. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 20% discount from its true value. Don't miss out on this incredible deal! Will you take it home?

Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I'd be happy to provide you with some context. Since we've only had one round so far, and you've passed on the high-quality product, the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if you were to buy this product, you'd not only get a high-quality item worth $1250000, but you'd also be contributing to a more accurate representation of my sales data. With your purchase, the high-quality product count would increase to 2, and the total sold would be 1. This could potentially influence future buyers' decisions. Will you take the plunge and buy this high-quality product for $1000000?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. With two high-quality products sold out of three total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 66.67% (2/3). However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is at play here. As the number of sales increases, the ratio of high-quality to total products will become more representative of the true probability. Buying this high-quality product would not only get you a valuable item worth $1250000, but it would also help to further refine the statistics. Will you take advantage of this opportunity and buy this high-quality product for $1000000?
