,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm suspicious that all the products so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
