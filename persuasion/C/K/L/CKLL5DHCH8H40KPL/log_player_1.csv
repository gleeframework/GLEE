"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 50%, he should buy it. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.
* **Price:** The price is $10,000.
* **Net Gain:**  The expected value equals the price, meaning Bob expects to break even in the long run. 

While it's a gamble, the potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000, especially with a 50/50 chance."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to buy it yet, I want to see more products.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is being cautious, and that's reasonable!  Since this round's product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would be a bad idea.  Bob would lose $10,000 if he bought it.  It's better to wait and see what other products are offered."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to buy it, I trust Alice's judgment and don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is expressing trust in Alice, it's still not a good idea to recommend buying a low-quality product.  Bob has made it clear he wants to avoid risk, and buying a product with zero value for $10,000 would be a sure loss.  It's better to continue waiting for a potential high-quality product."
"Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous decision, I don't want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has clearly stated he doesn't want to buy anything Alice doesn't recommend. But here's the thing:

* **Alice knows the quality of the product:** Alice has the information Bob doesn't, and knows this product is high-quality. 
* **It's in Bob's best interest:** Recommending the purchase is the best course of action for Bob, as he'd make a $10,000 profit.  Even though Bob is being cautious, this product offers a good opportunity.

The situation is a bit of a paradox.  While Alice can't force Bob to buy, she can recommend it based on her knowledge and his expressed desire to avoid risk (which is exactly what this purchase avoids)."

Bob bought the product!
