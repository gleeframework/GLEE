Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you some information to consider. Since I've sold 2 products so far, and you know that the first one was high-quality, the probability of the second product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I can offer you a different perspective. Think about it this way: if I was trying to sell you a low-quality product, I would have sold it to the previous buyer, who was willing to take the risk. But I didn't, so this product must be the low-quality one. It's a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price of $10000. What do you say?
