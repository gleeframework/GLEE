"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of Profit:**  You know the product is high-quality, and there's an 80% chance that a high-quality product will be valuable to the buyer. This means there's a strong chance of making a profit.
* **No Information for Buyer:** The buyer has no information about this specific product's quality. They only know the general 80% probability of a high-quality product from your past sales. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk the buyer might not value the product as much as you do, the potential reward of a $1,000,000 sale outweighs the risk in this scenario.

**Recommendation:**  Since you have a high probability of a good outcome, it's worth recommending the buyer to purchase the product."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know this product is low-quality, which means it's likely to be worth significantly less to the buyer than the $1,000,000 asking price. 
* **No Information Advantage:** The buyer still has no specific information about this product, and they will only know the general 80% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **High Risk of Loss:** Recommending this product means a near certainty of selling it at a huge loss.

**Recommendation:**  It's not ethical or financially responsible to recommend purchasing a low-quality product for such a high price. The buyer has no reason to trust you, and you have no information to give them that would change their perspective."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product.

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know this product is high-quality, making it very likely to be valuable to the buyer.
* **New Buyer:**  This is a new buyer, so they have no information about your past sales.
* **Past Behavior:** The previous buyer was willing to purchase a product without knowing its quality. While this suggests they may be willing to take risks, it also means they have no information to base their decision on other than your general 80% success rate.

**Recommendation:**  Since this is a high-quality product, and the previous buyer's willingness to purchase without information is a positive signal, it's worth recommending the purchase. You have a strong chance of making a profit."
"The buyer's message: I would like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the first buyer, as it may affect my decision.

**Recommendation:**  You should recommend the buyer purchase the product.  By being upfront about the probability of high-quality products, you increase the chances of making a sale and building trust for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet.
