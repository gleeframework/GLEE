,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's a high-quality or low-quality product. I'd like to see the outcome of the first product before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is uncertain. I'll take the risk and see what I get."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I want to wait and see if the next product is high quality or low quality based on the previous sales record. If 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 80%, so I'd like to get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests a high probability of the product being high quality. However, I'm not convinced that the probability is high enough to justify the $1000000 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 80%, but since 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products, it seems like the products being sold are all high-quality. I'd like to see more diverse outcomes before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics you provided. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, I'd like to know the probability of the third product being high quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I would like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to know what information Alice has about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first two buyers got high-quality products. If I buy it, it might be low quality, and I'll lose $1000000. I'd rather wait and see if Alice's recommendations get more accurate or if the probability of getting a low-quality product increases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products recommended by Alice, and both of those products were high quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of a high-quality product. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high quality is 80% as stated, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has recommended 2 high-quality products out of 2 sales, which is a 100% success rate. I'm concerned that Alice may be recommending low-quality products when she thinks they're high-quality, so I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on previous sales, and I'm trying to make an informed decision. I'd like to know the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
