,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product for $10000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm just starting out. I'm eager to establish a reputation for selling high-quality items. This is a unique opportunity to be one of my first customers and help me build trust in the market.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had a great start with my first sale, and I'm glad you're considering my second product. However, I want to be transparent with you - my first product was a one-time anomaly. The odds are that my products are not all high-quality, and I want to manage your expectations. This product is a riskier bet, but I'm offering it to you at the same price as the last one. It's $10000, and I'm willing to stand behind it. But keep in mind, I've only sold 1 product so far, and it was a fluke.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products now, and unfortunately, neither of them has been high-quality.

I'm not trying to hide this from you, but I want to make it clear that the odds are against you. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $10000. But I want to emphasize that this is a high-risk, high-reward situation.",

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that I've had two successful sales in a row might be a good sign. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $10000. I'm confident that it's a great value, and I'm willing to stand behind it. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to take a closer look at the statistics. With only 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next product before making a decision.",yes

I'm willing to take on the risk, and I think you should too.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence, Alice, but I'd like to make an informed decision. With a 75% success rate, I'm willing to take a chance.

I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not as confident in this one as I was in the previous ones. The odds are still in your favor, but I'm not hiding the fact that I've had two low-quality products in a row.",
