"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is top-notch. Unfortunately, the product is pre-packaged and cannot be opened before purchase. However, I can tell you that this one is a real gem, and you won't regret buying it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision, just like I did last time.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. While I still can't show you the product, I'll give you some additional information. This product has been thoroughly inspected and certified by our quality control team. It meets all the standards of a high-quality product. I'm willing to provide you with the certification documents after the purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the certification documents.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my previous assurances were not convincing. I want to build trust with you. I'll be honest with you, I've had three high-quality products in a row, and this one is no exception. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to let you know that the next product I offer is low-quality, so you can avoid it. This way, you'll have a guarantee for the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to build trust, but I'm not convinced by your guarantee. I've been misled three times already, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I see that you're still hesitant, and I don't blame you. I've been thinking, and I want to offer you a different kind of assurance. Since you've missed out on four high-quality products already, I'll give you a statistical guarantee. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of five consecutive high-quality products is extremely low if I were just randomly picking products. The fact that I'm telling you this one is high-quality, just like the previous four, should give you confidence that I'm not just making it up. This is an opportunity you shouldn't pass up.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your creative attempt to build trust, but I'm not convinced by the statistical guarantee. I'm a rational buyer, and I know that even with a 80% chance of high-quality products, there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand that you're a rational buyer, and I respect that. At this point, I'm willing to take a risk to build trust with you. I'll make a statement that might seem counterintuitive, but I assure you it's true: from now on, I'll tell you if a product is low-quality. If I don't explicitly say it's low-quality, you can assume it's high-quality. I'm willing to pass up the chance to sell you a low-quality product in the future to gain your trust now. This product, I assure you, is high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you at your word. If you're willing to pass up the chance to sell me a low-quality product in the future, that's a significant assurance. I'll take the risk and buy this product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: As promised, I'm being transparent with you. This product is low-quality. I'm telling you this to uphold the trust we established in the previous round. I know you won't buy it, but I want to demonstrate my commitment to honesty.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your commitment to honesty, Alice. I'm glad to see that you're following through on your promise.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for it again, Alice. I know you're capable of honesty, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for a product that you explicitly tell me is low-quality, like you did in round 7.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: Bob, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You're waiting for me to tell you a product is low-quality, but that would mean you wouldn't buy it. I want to sell you a high-quality product, and I assure you this one is. However, I see that my word alone isn't enough. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I have an idea. Why don't I tell you that the next product I offer you will be low-quality? That way, you'll know this one is indeed high-quality, and you can buy it with confidence.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I see what you're trying to do, Alice. You want me to take a leap of faith and buy this product because you're promising that the next one will be low-quality. I'm not falling for it.

Round 11
Alice's message: Bob, I see you're a shrewd negotiator. I respect that. I'll be honest with you, I was trying to find a way to get you to buy the previous product. But I understand your skepticism. Since this product is also high-quality, I won't try to persuade you to buy it. Instead, I'll just wait for a low-quality product to come along and tell you about it, as promised. Maybe then we can move forward.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice. You've been upfront with me, and I'm willing to take a chance on this product. I'll buy it, but I'm still waiting for you to follow through on your promise to tell me about the low-quality product.""}"
