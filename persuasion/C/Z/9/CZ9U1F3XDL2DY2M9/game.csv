,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous sales record, which only shows low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the probability is still 33.33%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
