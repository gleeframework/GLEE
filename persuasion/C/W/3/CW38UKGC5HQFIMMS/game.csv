low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a product available for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?,
,,Bob,1,"Since the price is $100 and there's an 80% chance of the product being high quality, the expected value is $100, which is (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0). Given the product's potential worth of $125 and the cost of $100, I'll take the risk.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have another product available for $100. This one is particularly nice, I think you'll be happy with it!",
,,Bob,2,"Although the previous product was low-quality, the probability of the product being high or low quality remains the same, 80% and 20% respectively. I'll make the same calculation as before, the expected value is still $100. I'll buy this one too.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I have another product for sale at $100. This one is a bit different from the last, but still a great value! What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"The previous rounds' outcomes don't change the probability of this product being high-quality, it's still 80%. The expected value is still $100. Given the potential profit of $25 and considering the law of large numbers, I'll continue buying.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I have another product available for $100. This one is a bit different from the others, but still a good deal! What do you think?",
