Alice's message: Ah, glad you took the risk! As for your question, all previous buyers were aware of the statistics and made their decisions based on their own analysis. Some were more cautious than others, but they all had the same information you do now. As for me, I've sold 6 low-quality products in a row, and now I've finally broken the streak with a high-quality one! That means I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 10 total, which puts the probability of a high-quality product at 20%.
