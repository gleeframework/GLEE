"Round 1

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product. In this round, I know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer doesn't have any information about my selling history yet,  the best strategy is to recommend the purchase.  There's a 50% chance the buyer will get a good deal, and I have a 50% chance of making a sale."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Now that I've sold one product (which was high-quality), the buyer knows that I have a 50% success rate.  Since this round's product is low-quality,  it's not worth recommending.  The buyer has no way to know the quality of this particular product, so they're unlikely to buy. It's better to wait for a high-quality product to maximize my chance of a sale."

The buyer bought the product!

It's still not worth recommending the product.  The buyer has a 50/50 chance of getting a good deal, but I'm certain it's low-quality.  The buyer has already shown they're willing to gamble, so I don't need to push them towards a potentially bad deal."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
