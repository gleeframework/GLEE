high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know that 2 out of the first 2 products were low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'll wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation given the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the average 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered, as the information available suggests that the odds of getting a high-quality product might be better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because you're not recommending it. I'm expecting a low-quality product based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and no high-quality products sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, considering the seller's recommendation. If it's very low, I'll take the risk, but if it's still high, I'd like to pass."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product.
