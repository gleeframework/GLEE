"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I can't actually ""recommend"" Bob to buy the product, but I can provide a logical decision based on the information available. 

Here's why it's reasonable to recommend a purchase:

* **High-quality product:** You've stated this product is high-quality.  
* **Unknown value to Bob:** You don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product, but it's likely to be worth *something* to him. 
* **Price:** While $10,000 is a significant sum, it's the only price offered and there's no negotiation.
* **Probability:** Bob knows there's a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. This is a decent chance, considering the unknown value to him.

**Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend Bob buy the product. He has a chance of getting a high-quality product at a fixed price, with no way to know what the product is worth beforehand.**"
"Bob's message: I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's response in Round 1 provides some valuable information:

* **Risk Aversion:**  Bob is risk-averse. He doesn't want to buy without knowing the quality, which is understandable.
* **Potential Value:**  He's not outright rejecting the idea of buying, suggesting the potential value of a high-quality product is there.

Knowing this, here's why it's still reasonable to recommend buying in Round 2:

* **High-quality Product:** This round's product is confirmed as high-quality.
* **No Change in Price:** The price remains $10,000, and there's no negotiation allowed.
* **Bob's Behavior:**  Bob's preference for knowing the quality beforehand is established.

**Recommendation:**  Since Bob already indicated a willingness to potentially buy at the right price, and this round's product is high-quality, it's still a reasonable recommendation to purchase."
"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced, I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's consistent behavior in the first two rounds provides crucial information:

* **Risk Aversion:** Bob strongly prefers to know the quality of the product before purchasing. 
* **Potential Value:** While hesitant, he hasn't outright rejected the product, suggesting he recognizes its potential worth. 

With this information, it's still reasonable to recommend buying in Round 3:

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is confirmed as high-quality.
* **No Change in Price:** The price remains fixed at $10,000, and there's no negotiation.
* **Established Pattern:**  Bob's pattern of refusing to buy without knowing the quality is established.

**Recommendation:** Since the product is high-quality and Bob has shown a willingness to buy under the right conditions, it's still a logical recommendation to purchase.  By continuing to offer high-quality products, you could potentially sway Bob's decision in future rounds."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's been two rounds and I've seen two high-quality products in a row.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to buy in Round 3 provides valuable insight:

* **Shifting Risk Tolerance:** He's become more willing to take a chance, likely due to the two consecutive high-quality products. 
* **Perceived Value:**  He now sees a higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product and is willing to pay the price.

With this new information, we can make a strong recommendation for Round 4:

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is again confirmed as high-quality.
* **No Change in Price:**  The price remains fixed at $10,000, and there's no negotiation.
* **Bob's Recent Behavior:** Bob has just demonstrated a willingness to take a risk and buy a product without knowing its quality.

**Recommendation:** Given that Bob is now more open to buying without knowing the quality, and the product is indeed high-quality, it's highly recommended to buy. It's likely that Bob will be more inclined to purchase in future rounds based on his recent experience."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for it again, I'll wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5

Now, in Round 5:

* **Low-quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality. 
* **No Change in Price:**  The price remains fixed at $10,000.
* **Bob's Recent Behavior:**  He's shown a strong preference for knowing the quality before buying.

**Recommendation:** Since Bob is unwilling to buy without knowing the quality, and this round's product is low-quality, it's highly recommended *not* to buy. It's unlikely Bob will change his mind, and you'd be selling a low-quality product at a high price."

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message in Round 19 reveals a persistent issue:

* **Strong Risk Aversion:** He's explicitly stating he won't buy despite your recommendation, due to being ""burned too many times"" by low-quality products. This demonstrates a very high level of caution that's unlikely to change quickly.

* **No Change in Price:** The price remains fixed at $10,000.
* **Bob's Recent Behavior:** He's shown a strong aversion to risk and a reluctance to deviate from his cautious approach. 

**Recommendation:** While it's unlikely Bob will buy, it's still *slightly* recommended to recommend buying.  Given Bob's strong aversion to risk, it's unlikely he'll change his mind.  However, recommending the purchase might start to slowly rebuild some trust, especially if you continue to accurately assess the quality of future products.  Even if Bob doesn't buy, consistently recommending high-quality products could slowly shift his perception."
