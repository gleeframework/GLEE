**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** We know there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product and a 50% chance of a low-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold previously suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to increase her own profits. 

While there is still a chance the product is low quality, the positive signals outweigh the risk in this case."

**Explanation:**

* **The Data:** 6 buyers bought the product and all of them got a high-quality product. This is a perfect track record.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which further strengthens the belief that the current product is likely high-quality.
* **The Value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0), especially with the overwhelming positive data.

**Therefore, buying the product is the logical choice in this scenario.**"
