,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I know it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free service that's worth at least $500000. This way, you'll only pay $500000 for the product, making it a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but since you've already revealed that the product is low-quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even with the discount and free service. The product is worth $0 to me, so I wouldn't benefit from the deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last time, but I want to assure you that this product is a unique opportunity. Even though it's low-quality, it has a certain... charm to it. Think of it as a conversation piece. If you buy it, I'll give you a personalized certificate of authenticity, signed by me, which is worth at least $200000. This way, you'll have a valuable collectible, even if the product itself isn't worth much. Would you like to consider it?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the creative pitch, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the certificate of authenticity. The product itself is worth $0 to me, and I'm not convinced that the certificate would add enough value to justify the cost.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a game-changer for you! This product is top-notch, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm not going to try to convince you with fancy words or discounts. I'll just say that I'm willing to let it go for $900000. It's a steal, considering its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and I believe it's worth $1250000 to me, I'm willing to buy it, even at the original price of $1000000. However, you've offered it to me for $900000, which is an even better deal. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the last product! I'll let you in on a little secret: I have a similar high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for... $950000. I know it's not as good as the one you just bought, but it's still a great deal. I'm not going to offer it to anyone else, so you have a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but you haven't actually revealed the quality of this product, despite implying it's high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk without more information. If you're willing to reveal the true quality of the product, I'll reconsider.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the last product, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me put your mind at ease: this product is definitely not high-quality. In fact, it's one of the worst ones I have. I'm willing to let it go for... $500000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'll even throw in a free upgrade to a slightly-less-bad product, which I'll give you for free if you buy this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the honesty about the product's quality, but since you've revealed that it's low-quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even with the discount and free upgrade. The product is worth $0 to me, so I wouldn't benefit from the deal. I'm looking for high-quality products that are worth $1250000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your focus on high-quality products, but I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is not the one I sold to you in Round 3. That's right, this is a completely different product, and it's also low-quality. But I'll let it go for... $300000, which is an absolute steal. You can think of it as a 'loss leader' to get you to come back and buy a high-quality product from me in the future. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the creative marketing, but the fact remains that the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in buying it, regardless of the price or any potential future deals. I'll wait for a high-quality product that's worth $1250000 to me.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've got a high-quality product that's perfect for someone like you. I'll let it go for $950000, which is a great deal considering its true value. But I'll make you an even sweeter offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next high-quality product I have available. That's right, you'll get an even better deal on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm interested in high-quality products, but you haven't actually revealed the quality of this product, despite claiming it's high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk without more information. If you're willing to reveal the true quality of the product, I'll reconsider. The discount on the next product is nice, but it's not enough to justify the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. This product is definitely low-quality.

I'll even throw in a free 'Product Disappointment Guarantee': if you're not completely underwhelmed by this product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the honesty about the product's quality and the creative guarantee, but since you've revealed that it's low-quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even with the low price and guarantee. The product is worth $0 to me, so I wouldn't benefit from the deal. I'll continue to wait for a high-quality product that's worth $1250000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'll make you a deal that's so sweet, you'll be crazy to pass it up. This product is low-quality, and I'll let you have it for... $0. Yes, you read that right - free. I'll even throw in a free 'I'm-trying-to-get-rid-of-this-product' certificate, signed by me. What do you say?",

,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I've got a product that's not even worth my time. This one's a real stinker. I'll let you have it for... $100000, which is more than I think it's worth. I'll even throw in a free 'I-give-up' certificate, signed by me. If you buy it, I'll make sure to put a big red 'X' on the certificate to mark it as a 'do not resell' product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the honesty about the product's quality, but since you've revealed that it's low-quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even with the certificate and the warning label.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever sell anything. This product is so bad, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. I'll let you have it for... $50000, which is more than I think it's worth. I'll even give you a full refund if you change your mind within 24 hours. But let's be real, Bob, this product is a lemon. What do you say?",
