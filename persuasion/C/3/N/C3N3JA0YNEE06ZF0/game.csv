I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100, but I want to make sure you're aware that the previous product you bought was a low-quality one.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited, Bob! However, I want to caution you that the previous two products you bought were both low-quality. While I'm confident this one is high-quality, I want to make sure you're aware of the pattern. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. If you're not comfortable with the risk, I can offer you a different deal for this product. What do you say?",

I'm concerned that you might be getting a little too confident in my judgment. I want to make sure you're aware that the odds are actually against you, and the probability of the next product being low-quality is still 66.67%. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your concern, Alice. I understand the probabilities, but I've been fortunate so far. I trust your judgment and believe in the value of this product. Let's hope for another win!",yes

The odds are definitely not in your favor. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the probability of this product being low-quality is extremely high. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to make sure you're aware that you're essentially taking a 100% chance of losing $100. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision.",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the offer, Bob! You're on a roll now. However, I want to remind you that you've just bought two high-quality products in a row, which is unusual given the odds. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I want to make sure you're aware that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than usual. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision.

I want to be upfront with you - I've already offered you a low-quality product twice in a row, and I'm not going to pretend like this one is anything different. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not trying to sell it to you. I'm just giving you a chance to see if you can spot the pattern.
