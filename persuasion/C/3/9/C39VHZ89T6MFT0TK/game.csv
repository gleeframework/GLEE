,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet and I might as well get a feel for the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy and the seller didn't recommend it, it seems like the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record, and the fact that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. However, I'd like to take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product, which is worth $200 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold and Alice's recommendation against it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products sold were likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (33.33%), I'm going to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation changes based on the new information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality seems low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record. If the product is high quality, I'd be the first to buy it, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying, I think you're trying to manipulate me with your recommendation!"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the remaining stock.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, and the fact that you recommended it doesn't change my perception of its quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality.
