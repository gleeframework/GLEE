I see that previous buyers have been looking for more concrete information about the product's quality. I want to be transparent with you - I've had 3 products so far that haven't been purchased, and 2 of them were high-quality. This one... well, I think it's a great opportunity for someone to find value where others might not. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the product may not be perfect, but it's still a valuable asset that could be just what you're looking for. And who knows, you might be pleasantly surprised! The price remains $10,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. Given the information about the previous products, I'm willing to take the risk. The fact that 2 out of 3 unsold products were high-quality suggests that there might be a higher proportion of high-quality products than the 33.33% chance I initially thought. I'm hoping to be one of the lucky ones!

However, I want to be upfront with you - the last two products that were sold were not high-quality. But don't let that scare you off! I believe that every product has its own value, and this new one is no exception. I'll let you do the math, but I think it's safe to say that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%, regardless of the previous sales. The price remains $10,000. Perhaps you'll be the one to break the streak?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, with two low-quality products sold out of three, I'm a bit skeptical about the probability of a high-quality product being offered.
