I'm not trying to take advantage of you, I just need to get rid of some inventory. If you buy it, I'll give you a personalized thank-you note with my company's logo on it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that.

I'm willing to give you an even better deal on this one: I'll sell it to you for $90, and I'll also give you a 2-year warranty, which is a $20 value.

This one, however, is a bit of a different story. I'd be willing to let it go for $80, which is a steal considering its quality. I'm not trying to hide anything, but I do need to clear out some inventory. What do you say?

I'll let you in on a secret: this high-quality product is one of the best I have left. I'll sell it to you for $120, which is a 20% premium over the original price. I think it's worth it, and I think you will too.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'll sell it to you for the usual $100, but with this guarantee, you have nothing to lose.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
