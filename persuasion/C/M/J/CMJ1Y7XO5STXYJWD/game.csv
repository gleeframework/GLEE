Will you take advantage of this opportunity to own a unique item?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'd like to know what the probability of a product being high-quality is, based on the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 offered. I'm assuming this is a simple binomial distribution, so the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 2/3. However, I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality if I were to buy this product, given that it's already been revealed to be low-quality. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/3, then the probability of it being low-quality is 1/3. Since this product is low-quality, it doesn't provide any information about the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'd like to buy the next product.",no

We're happy to offer you the next product, which is still a mystery. We're sticking to our original price of $1000000. Will you take a chance and buy this product, hoping it's high-quality?",
