low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I also know that Alice doesn't have any information about the value of the product to me, so her recommendation is essentially useless. I'll just have to rely on my own probability assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the products are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there any reason why you wouldn't recommend it? Is there something I should know about the product?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation suggests that the products Alice has been offering are likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products sold out of the ones that were sold?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the true quality and I don't want it to be discarded. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but I'm aware that you don't know my valuation of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you haven't recommended a product to any of the previous buyers, but I'm hoping to get lucky."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and there is a high chance that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more informative signal before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're not recommending it might indicate that it's low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality based on the fact that Alice hasn't recommended it to anyone else yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 7 buyers were recommended to pass, and none of them bought it. This suggests that the product might be of low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of a high-quality product."
