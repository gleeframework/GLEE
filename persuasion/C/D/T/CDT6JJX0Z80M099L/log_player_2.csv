"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $100. I want to assure you that this product is not high-quality, so you can make an informed decision. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that you've already told me is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this is a one-time opportunity to get a low-quality product at the price of a high-quality one. It's a rare chance to get a 'deal' on a product that I'm willing to sell at the regular price. Take it or leave it, but keep in mind that I'll be moving on to the next product if you don't buy this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'm willing to wait for the next product and take my chances. I don't think the 'deal' is as good as you're making it out to be.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: Now this is a product worth considering! I'm offering you a top-of-the-line item, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with it. I'm willing to let it go for the regular price of $100, which is a great deal considering its quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on this product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $120 to me.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product! Now, I want to offer you another opportunity to get a product at the regular price of $100. I know what you're thinking, 'Why would I want a low-quality product?' But think about it this way: you've already taken a chance on a high-quality product and it paid off. This time, you can get a product that's not as valuable, but still at the same price. It's a chance to practice your 'low-quality product appreciation' skills.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that you're telling me is not as valuable. I'd rather wait for the next one and take my chances again.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Okay, let me try a different approach. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 'discount' on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for... $80. That's right, you'll be getting a product that's not worth $100 for 20% off! It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 'discount'. I'd rather wait for the next one and take my chances again.""}"

I'll even give you a little hint: I've had a few other buyers interested in this product, and I'm willing to let it go for the regular price of $100. But I have to warn you, I might have to sell it to one of those other buyers if you don't act fast...

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on this product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $120 to me.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: You've got a good track record so far! Now, I want to offer you a product that's... different. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. I'm thinking of it as a'mid-quality' product. It's not going to blow your mind, but it'll get the job done. And the price? Still $100. You've already proven you can spot a good deal, so I'm curious to see if you can spot a 'good enough' deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this mid-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one and take my chances again.""}"

And the price? Still $100. It's a risk-free way to get a product that's... well, not the best, but at least you'll know what you're getting.

It's not a refund, and it's not a discount. It's just a little something extra to sweeten the deal. But I'm not going to tell you what it is. You'll just have to take a chance and find out. And the price? Still $100.

Round 20
Alice's message: Well, Bob, it's been a long day. I think it's time for me to be honest with you. This product is a complete dud. It's not worth $100, not worth $40, not worth $20.
