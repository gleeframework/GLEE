,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a 50% discount from its value to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and your recommendation doesn't change my perception of the product's quality."

I'd rather wait for the next product and get a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
