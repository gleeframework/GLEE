  ""message"": ""I'm not trying to manipulate you, I'm just trying to be honest. Let's look at the data: you've bought one high-quality product from me for $100, and you've passed on two low-quality products. That means that the high-quality product is worth at least $100 to you, since you were willing to pay that much for it. And the low-quality products aren't worth $100 to you, since you're not willing to pay that much for them. So, if you're willing to pay $100 for a product that's 50% likely to be high-quality, and 50% likely to be low-quality, then this product is a good deal for you. What do you say?""
