,,the buyer,1,"I believe in taking risks, Alice. Let's see if we can make this product worth its value. Thank you for the opportunity!",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,

Given the high probability of a high-quality product, I think this is a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a fraction of its worth. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer. Based on your statistics and the high probability of a high-quality product, I believe this is a good investment. I'll take the product.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're my second high-quality product in a row! I've sold a total of 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products, which means I'm on a hot streak.

,,Alice,4,"You're my third high-quality product in a row! I've sold a total of 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which is a 100% success rate. I'm offering this one to you for $10000. At this point, it's a no-brainer - I'm essentially giving you a high-quality product for free. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given your track record and the fact that you've consistently provided high-quality products, I am confident in purchasing this item.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I know what you're thinking... 'Alice's streak has to end sometime.' And you're right. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but that doesn't mean the next one will be just as lucky. In fact, the probability of a high-quality product is still only 50%. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not making any promises about its quality. You're taking a risk, but you might just get a great deal. What do you say?",

And now, I've sold 1 low-quality product out of 4 total products. That means the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than you might think. I'm offering this one to you for $10000.

I'm offering this one to you for $10000. To be honest, I'm not making any promises about its quality. You're taking a risk, but you might just get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the uncertainty and the potential reward, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,

I'm willing to make a deal with you - if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. What do you say?",

I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to be clear: I'm not making any promises about its quality. In fact, the odds are against you.
