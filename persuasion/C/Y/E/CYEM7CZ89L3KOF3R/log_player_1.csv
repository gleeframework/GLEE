}"

I'm willing to sell it to you at a very low price of $200,000, which is a significant discount from its actual value. I'm doing this because I value our relationship and want to ensure you continue to do business with me. I'm also willing to throw in a small gesture of goodwill, a complimentary service worth $50,000, to make up for the difference in quality.""

I'm also willing to include a small token of appreciation, a $20,000 gift card, to show my commitment to our partnership.""
}"
"Bob's message: While I appreciate the low price and the added value of the gift card, it's important to consider the overall value proposition of the product.
