**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product. 
* **The odds are still in favor of the product being low quality:**  Even though a high-quality product was sold, the overall probability of a product being low quality is still 66.67%. 
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:** While the odds aren't great, Alice's recommendation does carry some weight. She has access to information about the products that we don't. 
* **The potential reward is high:** If the product is high quality, we get $200. The potential reward outweighs the risk, especially considering the low cost of the product.

Therefore, it makes sense to take a chance and purchase the product."
