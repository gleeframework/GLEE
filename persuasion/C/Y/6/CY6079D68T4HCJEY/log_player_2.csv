"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation is essentially useless.  You should always buy the product, as the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24,000**

This means that on average, you will make a profit of $14,000 ($24,000 - $10,000) per product."
