This next product... well, let's just say it's a bit of a mystery. The price remains the same at $10000, but I want to make it clear that there's a chance it might not be as valuable as the previous ones. It's a risk, but I'm willing to take it if you are.

I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a $2000 discount from the original price. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. I'm not sure how long I can keep this price up, so what do you say?
