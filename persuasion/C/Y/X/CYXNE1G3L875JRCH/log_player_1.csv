The correct probability of the product being high-quality is actually 50% because 8 high-quality products out of 16 total products is indeed a 50% chance.

Assuming that the unsold products are also high-quality, the total number of high-quality products is 14 out of 18. Therefore, the probability of a product being high-quality is 14/18 = 77.78%.
