**Explanation:**

* **Previous Sales Data:**  There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This is a positive sign, but not conclusive.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is valuable information. While she doesn't know your individual valuation, she presumably has some insight into the product's quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:** Since the product is worth $125 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality,  and the odds are 50/50, there's a potential for a significant gain.

**Considering the recommendation and the prior sale, it makes sense to buy the product.**  The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Previous Sales:**  2 of the previous 2 buyers purchased high-quality products. This suggests a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Even if there's a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential gain of $125 if it's high quality outweighs the risk of losing $100 if it's low quality. 

Therefore, it's a good gamble to take."
