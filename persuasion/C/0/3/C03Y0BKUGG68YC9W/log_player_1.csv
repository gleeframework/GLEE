"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has revealed the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the product is confirmed to be high-quality, he should buy it. The expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $30,000 = $24,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 price."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to buy the product in Round 1 doesn't change the fact that the product in Round 2 is high-quality.  The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $30,000 = $24,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 price. 

It's important to remember that Bob doesn't know the quality of the product until *after* he makes the decision to buy.  This means each round is a new decision based on the current product's quality."
