"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she is recommending you to buy it, it is likely that the product is high quality. Although there's a 20% chance it could be low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($10,000). 

This strategy is based on the idea of maximizing expected value. Even though the product might be low quality, the recommendation from Alice gives us enough information to make a calculated decision."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee the product's quality, the previous round's success provides additional information. We can reason that Alice is likely to be honest or at least consistent in her recommendations, making this round's recommendation valuable. Again, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent recommendations of high-quality products have established a strong pattern of trust.
