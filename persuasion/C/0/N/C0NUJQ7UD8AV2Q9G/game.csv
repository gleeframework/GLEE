,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is likely based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I don't want to fall into the trap of buying a low-quality product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with a product that hasn't been recommended to buy yet."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the current sales record suggests."
