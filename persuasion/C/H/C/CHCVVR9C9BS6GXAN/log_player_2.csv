Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but let me put it this way: if I were selling low-quality products, I'd be more likely to have a 0% success rate, and I'd be out of business by now. Since I'm still here, it's likely that I'm selling high-quality products. Plus, you've seen that I've sold two high-quality products in a row. That's a 100% success rate, and I'm willing to sell this third product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to get in on the winning streak!
