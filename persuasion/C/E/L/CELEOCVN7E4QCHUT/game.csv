low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, but I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product sold, which suggests that the product I'm about to buy might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you know my valuation, but I'm going to trust my own judgment and take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers who bought the product didn't get a high-quality one? If so, I'd like to consider that in my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would mean I'd get it for $0 and you'd be wrong in your assessment. I'm essentially making a bet on the product being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have not purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. Given the lack of information about the quality of the products, I'll pass on the current product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm skeptical of the recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering may be low-quality."
