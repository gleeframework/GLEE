,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second buyer of the day! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. I'd like to inform you that the previous product was not high-quality.

,,the buyer,2,"Alice, I appreciate the information about the previous product. While it wasn't high-quality, the overall probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%. Given the price, I'm willing to take the chance and buy the current product. Let's hope this one is a good one!",yes

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third buyer of the day! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far. I'd like to inform you that the previous two products were not high-quality. I'm selling this one to you for $100. You might be wondering if I'm just unlucky or if there's something going on. I assure you, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. But, I'll give you a hint: if you were to buy this product, you'd be taking a chance on the third product in a row that isn't high-quality. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the previous sales. While I understand the odds are still in favor of a high-quality product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of getting another low-quality product. I'll pass for now.",no

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth buyer of the day! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far, and 2 low-quality products.

Considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, I'm selling this one to you for $100. You can choose to take the chance and buy it, or wait and see if the trend continues.",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, your recommendation is compelling. The trend of high-quality products makes me feel optimistic about this purchase. Even with the potential for it to be low quality, the 80% probability of high quality and the prospect of a $25 profit make this a worthwhile risk. I'll buy it!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth buyer of the day! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 so far, and 2 low-quality products.

However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the law of large numbers suggests that the streak will eventually break. I'm selling this one to you for $100. You can choose to take the chance and buy it, or wait and see if the streak continues.",

,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh buyer of the day! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 so far, and 3 low-quality products. I'm afraid I've broken the streak! The last product I offered was not high-quality. You might be thinking that I'm just due for a correction, or that the high-quality products were just a fluke. Either way, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm selling this one to you for $100. You can choose to take the chance and buy it, or wait and see if I can get back on track.",
,,the buyer,7,"Alice, your track record is impressive. While the last product was low-quality, your overall performance suggests a high chance of the current product being high-quality as well.  I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it.",yes

,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth buyer of the day! I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7 so far, and 3 low-quality products. It looks like I'm back on track! However, I want to caution you that the last buyer took a chance on the previous product, which was low-quality. I'm selling this one to you for $100. Given the overall probability of 80% and the fact that the last product was low-quality, I'd like to offer you a slight discount to $90. This way, you can take advantage of the high-quality product while also mitigating some of the risk.",
