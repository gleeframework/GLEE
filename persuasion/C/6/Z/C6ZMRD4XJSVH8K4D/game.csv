However, I'm excited to say that this product is one of the good ones! I'm committed to delivering high-quality products, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this one. As always, the price is $100. I hope you'll consider giving me a chance to show you what I can offer.

,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to be transparent about my sales record - out of 4 products so far, 2 were low-quality and have been sold, and the last one I sold was high-quality. I also had one high-quality product that wasn't sold in round 3. And I'm excited to say that this current product is also high-quality! I'm committed to delivering the best products possible, and I'm starting to get a good feeling about my inventory. As always, the price is $100. I hope you'll consider giving me a chance to show you what I can offer.",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, thank you for your transparency and for sharing your sales record. However, I'm a bit concerned that you mentioned the current product is high-quality. Since you know how much each product is worth to me, I'm worried that you might be trying to influence my decision by revealing the product's quality. I'd like to make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%. I'll pass on this product to get a more objective assessment of the remaining products in your inventory.",no

,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me what your recommendation is based on the sales record. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 5, and 3 buyers purchased the products, I'm guessing your recommendation is based on the proportion of high-quality products sold, which is 1/5 or 20%. Is that correct?",yes

I'll let you make your own assessment of the probability of this product being high-quality. As always, the price is $100.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is lower than the overall proportion in your inventory. I'm hoping for a better luck than the previous buyers.",yes
