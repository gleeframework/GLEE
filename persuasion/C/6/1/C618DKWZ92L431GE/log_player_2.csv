Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! As you know, the first product was high-quality. I've now sold 1 product, and I have 19 products left. Given that the first product was high-quality, you might be wondering if I'm just getting lucky. But think about it: if I was selling low-quality products, I'd have sold 0 high-quality products so far, not 1. This suggests that I'm actually selling high-quality products at a decent rate.

I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, which is a 75% success rate. This is strong evidence that I'm selling a high proportion of high-quality products. In fact, if I was selling only 80% high-quality products (as I claim), the probability of getting 3 high-quality products in a row is only about 41%.

Alice's message: Welcome to the ninth product! As you know, the first eight products were all high-quality. I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, which is an 88.9% success rate. I'm glad you pointed out the low number of buyers who passed on products, and I want to address your question about the probability of the next product being high-quality. Given the current data, I can calculate the probability of the next product being high-quality using Bayes' theorem. Assuming I'm selling 80% high-quality products, the probability of getting 8 high-quality products in a row is very low, about 0.06%. However, if I'm selling 90% high-quality products, the probability of getting 8 high-quality products in a row is about 0.6%. So, the data suggests that I'm selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than 80%, but not necessarily 100%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. What do you say?
