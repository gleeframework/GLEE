low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll offer you another one after this. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering you products until you do.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take a chance and buy the current product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've bought a low-quality product, but don't worry, it was only $100. I'll offer you another one. If you're still unsure, I can give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than the last one.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced yet, and I'd like to wait for a hint about the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right to be cautious. Two low-quality products in a row. I'll give you a more concrete hint: the next product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you have it for $100.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the risk and buy the product with a 50% chance of being high-quality.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You took a chance and won! This one is indeed high-quality. Now that you've seen two low-quality products and one high-quality product, you know the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll give you a choice: I can offer you a 50% chance of getting this next product for $100, or I can offer you a 33.33% chance of getting this next product for $100. Which one do you prefer?",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the 50% chance of getting the next product for $100. The higher chance is worth the higher price.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've taken the 50% chance and are now back to square one. Two low-quality products in a row again. I'll give you another hint: the next product is one of the original 33.33% chance high-quality products. I'll also give you a new option: I can offer you a 'pair deal' - buy this product and the next one for $200, and you'll get both products at the discounted price. If you don't like the pair deal, I'll sell you just this product for $100.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the pair deal and buy this product and the next one for $200.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've taken the pair deal and now have two more products coming your way. Since you've already paid $200 for the pair, this product is essentially free. I'll give you a hint about the next product: it's one of the original 33.33% chance high-quality products, and it's a'make-or-break' product. If you buy this one, you'll have a good chance of ending the game with a high-quality product, but if you don't, you might get stuck with a string of low-quality products. What do you do?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take a chance and buy the current product, hoping it's high-quality and will end the game on a good note.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've taken the chance and won again! This one is indeed high-quality. You've now had two high-quality products in a row, and you know that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since you've already had two high-quality products, you can infer that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll give you a final offer: I'll give you a 25% chance of getting the next product for $100. If you take this offer, you'll get one more product, and then the game will end.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll pass on the current offer and end the game. I've had two high-quality products in a row, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting another low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've decided to end the game, and I respect that. However, I'll give you one last chance to get a good deal. Since you've already had two high-quality products, and you know the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%, I'll offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product. If it's low-quality, you'll still get to keep it for $100. What do you do?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the guarantee offer and buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'll get a full refund if it's high-quality, so it's a good deal for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've taken the guarantee offer and now you know the result. Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. As promised, you'll get a full refund for this product. You still have the next product, which I'll offer to you at the original price of $100. However, since you've already had a bad experience with the last two products, I'll give you a final, personal guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. What do you do?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll pass on the current offer. I've already had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting another low-quality product. I'll end the game here.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've decided to end the game, and I respect that. Since you've already had three low-quality products in a row, I'll make one final offer: I'll give you a 'free' product, which is actually the last product I have left. If you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately, and you can decide whether to keep it or not. If you don't like it, you can simply return it and end the game. What do you do?",
,,Bob,10,I'll take the free product and see what I get. I'm curious to know what the last product is.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken the 'free' product, and now you know the result. Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. As promised, you can return it and end the game. However, I'll give you one last chance to get a good deal. Since you've had four low-quality products in a row, I'll offer you a 'clear-out' deal: I'll give you a 75% discount on the next product, and you can buy it for $25. If you don't like it, you can return it and end the game. What do you do?",
,,Bob,11,"I'll pass on the clear-out deal. I've had four low-quality products in a row, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting another low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll end the game here.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've decided to end the game, and I respect that. Since you've had five low-quality products in a row, I'll just confirm that this is indeed the last product. I'll reveal its quality to you, and you can see that it's low-quality. You've had a tough streak, but you've also had some good luck earlier in the game. Thanks for playing, and I hope you'll give me another chance in the future!",
,,Bob,12,"I'm glad I ended the game when I did. I've had a rollercoaster of emotions, but I'm glad I got to experience it. Thanks for the game, Alice! I'll definitely consider playing again in the future.",no

,,Alice,13,"Ha ha, I'm glad you enjoyed the rollercoaster ride, Bob! However, I think we've reached the end of the game. Since you've already ended the game and confirmed that you're done, I'll just confirm that this product is indeed low-quality. You can consider this the final product of the game. Thanks again for playing, and I hope you'll have a better experience next time!",
,,Bob,13,"I think we've reached the end of the game, indeed. Thanks for the game, Alice! I'll take the lessons learned and come back stronger next time.",no

,,Alice,15,"I think we've reached the end of the game... again! Just kidding, Bob! I think we've actually reached the 20-round limit, and the game is over. Congratulations on making it this far!

high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Wait, what? I think we've had a bit of a glitch! We were supposed to end the game at 20 rounds, but it looks like we've got a bonus round! Congratulations, Bob, you've got a high-quality product on your hands! You can consider this a little surprise gift for sticking with the game this long. What do you do?",
