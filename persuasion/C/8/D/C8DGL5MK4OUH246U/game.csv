,,Alice,12,no,

I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know how much the product is worth to me, but I don't know how many low-quality products you've sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% because I know you've already sold 3 products and none of them were high-quality. If the probability was truly 33.33%, I'd expect to see at least one high-quality product sold by now."
