But I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to think that I might be getting a little too good at this.

But here's the thing: I'm not just a one-trick pony. I've been selling products for a while now, and I've got a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't. This next product is still available for $10000, and I'm confident that it's worth it. But if you're still hesitant, I can offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $9000. What do you say?""}"

And let's be real, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% - that's a pretty high bar to clear. I'm not asking you to take a wild guess or make a leap of faith. I'm offering you a product that's been proven to be high-quality multiple times before. And I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. So what do you say? Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?""}"
