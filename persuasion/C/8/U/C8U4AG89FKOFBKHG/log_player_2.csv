**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  You have very limited information: one buyer bought a high-quality product before. This doesn't give you a strong signal about the quality of the current product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable because she knows the true quality of the product.  While she might be trying to sell a low-quality product, there's a chance she's being honest.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**In this case, the potential payoff is too high to ignore, even with limited information.**"
