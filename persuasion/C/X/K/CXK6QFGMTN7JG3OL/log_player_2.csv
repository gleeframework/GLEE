**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. 
* **High Quality Probability:**  Even though we don't know the specific product quality, there's an 80% chance it's high quality. 
* **Potential Upside:** The potential payoff for a high-quality product ($300) is significantly higher than the cost ($100).

**Overall:**  The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario, and Alice's recommendation provides some confidence."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high quality, there's a very strong indication that the product is likely to be high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $300 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100."
