**Explanation:**

The statistics indicate a strong likelihood of the current product being high quality. Since the offer is for $100, and a high-quality product is worth $200, this presents a potentially lucrative opportunity. Here's the breakdown:

* **3 high-quality products sold out of 4:**  This means a 75% success rate for buyers.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While not foolproof, Alice's recommendation is a positive signal, suggesting she believes the product is of high quality. 

**Taking the risk:** The risk is the potential of getting a low-quality product, resulting in a $100 loss. However, the potential reward of $100 profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk based on the current statistics."

**Explanation:**

* **High Sale Rate:** 7 out of 9 buyers purchased products that turned out to be high quality, a success rate of 77.78%. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% probability of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who presumably wants to maximize her sales, is recommending you buy the product. This suggests she has a good reason to believe it is high quality. 

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the data and Alice's recommendation strongly suggest this is a good deal."
