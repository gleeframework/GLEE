,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous two products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low number of sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
