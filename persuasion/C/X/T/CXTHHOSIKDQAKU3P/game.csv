,,the buyer,20,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $12000, the expected value is $4000. This is less than the asking price of $10000. Without additional information from previous sales to adjust my confidence in the product's quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price."
