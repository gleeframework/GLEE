A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

You now know that you have sold one product, and it was high-quality.  The buyer doesn't know this, but they do know the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  

Since you have no information about the value of the product to the buyer, and you know this product is low-quality, it's not in your best interest to recommend it. There's no guarantee they'll find it valuable enough to justify the price, and you have a higher chance of making a sale in the future with a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since you're not recommending the product, and the sales data indicates a 100% chance of a high-quality product being sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

Since this product is low-quality, and the buyer has some information suggesting it might be, it's not a good strategy to recommend it.  You are better off waiting for a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since the product was not recommended by you, I will pass on this one. I would like to see if you recommend future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
