Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's statistically advantageous to recommend the purchase.  Even though the buyer doesn't know the specific worth of a high-quality product, there's a good chance it will be worth more than $10,000 to them."

* **Maintaining Credibility:**  Recommending a low-quality product risks damaging your reputation and future sales.
