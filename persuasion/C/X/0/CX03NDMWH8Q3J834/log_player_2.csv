"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, Alice's recommendation provides valuable information.  Since she knows the product's true quality, it's likely she's recommending a high-quality product. It's a calculated risk worth taking to potentially gain a $2,500 profit."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation holds significant weight. Since she knows the product's true quality, her lack of recommendation strongly suggests it's low quality.  The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of a high-quality product in this case."
