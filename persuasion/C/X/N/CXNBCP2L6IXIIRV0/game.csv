,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, which might indicate a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but neither of them got a high-quality product.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it. I've taken into account the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold to the previous buyers were low-quality. If I buy this product, I'll be taking a high risk of getting a low-quality product, which is not worth $1000000 to me. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to get the high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, and I'm trying to infer that it might be low-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping to get a better sense of the product's quality by buying it and seeing what happens."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your past recommendations, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. If that's the case, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might be a coincidence. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 7 buyers have all passed on the products, and I'm willing to take the risk. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm expecting a higher chance of getting a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential reward."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is very low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm doing this based on the low sales record and the fact that all previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high."
