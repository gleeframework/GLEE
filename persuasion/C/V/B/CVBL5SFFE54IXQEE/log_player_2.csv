Round 3
Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great decision last round, Bob! Now, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to diversify your portfolio.

I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it and decide it's not for you, I'll buy it back from you for $5000. This way, you can try it out risk-free.

I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to clear out inventory, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a product at a bargain price. It's not a high-quality item, but it might still have some value to you.

Instead, I'll offer you a unique deal: I'll let you inspect the product for free, and you can decide whether to buy it or not.
