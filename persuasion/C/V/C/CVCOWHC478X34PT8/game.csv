,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I also want to be transparent with you. Since you're a discerning buyer, I'd like to give you some context. I've sold many products to customers in the past, and I've had a 33.33% success rate with high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a 'no questions asked' return policy for this round, where if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first product! As promised, I'm offering you a high-quality product this time.

I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. However, I also want to be upfront with you that the return policy I offered earlier is only applicable to this round. If you're not satisfied with this product, you'll need to work with me to find a mutually agreeable solution. The price remains the same at $10000. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. The return policy change makes me hesitant, and I'm not sure if the advanced design and longer warranty period are worth the risk of buying another potentially low-quality product.",no

For this round, I'm sticking to the original price of $10000. I understand that you may be hesitant after the previous low-quality product, but I want to assure you that this product has a unique feature that sets it apart from the previous one. I'm not at liberty to disclose the details just yet, but I'm willing to offer you a 'best offer' option. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a 10% chance to negotiate the price down to a price of your choice, but if you decline, the price remains at $10000. What are your thoughts?",

Given your request for more concrete evidence, I'm willing to provide you with a video demonstration of the product's performance.

However, I want to make it clear that the video will be a 'warts and all' presentation, showing both the product's strengths and weaknesses. I'll also include a statement from a satisfied customer who has purchased a similar product in the past. The price remains at $10000, and the 30-day money-back guarantee still applies. What do you think?",
