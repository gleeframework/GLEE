,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll get a good deal."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product existing. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it suggests it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take on the risk of buying a product that's not worth $1200000 to me."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality. I'll pass on this one too."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on Alice's recommendation alone."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'll buy it and see if I get lucky."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
