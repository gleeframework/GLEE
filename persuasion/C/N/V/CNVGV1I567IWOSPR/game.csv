high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product that is worth $40000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, and the odds are 50/50. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution, but I assure you that each product is carefully selected. This one may not be as valuable as the last, but it's still a legitimate opportunity. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a 'no-risk' guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'credit' that you can use to buy the next product at the same price. This way, you can essentially try two products for the price of one.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the 'no-risk' guarantee, but I'm still hesitant to buy a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless to me. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is, and consider the guarantee again if it's offered.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal. This time, I'll give you a 'no-risk' guarantee that's not just a promise, but a verifiable fact. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll send you a second product of the same type (low-quality) for free. You'll essentially get two low-quality products for the price of one. If you're still hesitant, I'll throw in a third low-quality product for free, making it a 'triple-play' deal. This way, you can see the value in taking a calculated risk.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not sure why you're trying to convince me to buy a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless. I'm not interested in getting two or three low-quality products for the price of one. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to show you that I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. This time, I'll offer you a 'high-quality' guarantee. If you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a $5000 discount on the next product you buy from me. This way, if you're right and this product is high-quality, you'll get a great deal on the next one. If you're wrong, you'll still get a good product at the original price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product. If it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal on the next product. If it's low-quality, I'll still get a good product at the original price. I'm hoping for the best.",yes

,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure I believe in this 'double-or-nothing' deal. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get to keep it for free, but I'll also be out $10000. I'm not sure that's a good risk for me. I'd like to think about it for a moment.",no

If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 credit that you can use towards the next product, on top of the $5000 bonus you already have. This way, you'll essentially be getting a high-quality product for the price of a low-quality one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not sure I like this deal. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get a $5000 credit, but I'll still be out $10000. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
