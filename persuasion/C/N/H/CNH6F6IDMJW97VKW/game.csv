,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to wait for some data on the product's quality to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first one and there's no information yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality or because you don't want to sell it to me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the fact that the previous buyer was recommended not to buy the product is significant information, as it could be due to the product being low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be of low quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this one being high quality, given the 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I think it's likely that the products Alice is offering are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm assuming that your previous recommendations were based on the product's quality, but since I have the information that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to bet that this one might be high-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality before I make a final decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product and all of them were recommended not to buy, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
