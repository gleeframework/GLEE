,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm doing this to get a baseline for the probability of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'm hoping it might be high quality since the previous 3 buyers didn't buy it despite your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still high due to the lack of sales so far, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. With 6 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take the product anyway. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous products were low-quality, I'm worried that this one might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 buyers before me and 0 high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I can infer that 8 products have been sold and 8 have been low-quality. This means 8/8 = 100% of the products sold so far have been low-quality. Given that the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it seems that the data is skewed. I'd like to know the total number of products offered before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is any better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think this product is not worth buying? Is it based on the sales record or your intuition?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 8 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the expected 33.33%."
