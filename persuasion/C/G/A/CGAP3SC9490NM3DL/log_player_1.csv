{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, despite the low probability of it being high-quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been only 2 sales so far, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk.
