It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a significant markdown from its actual value. Plus, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, so you can have peace of mind. What do you say?",

I'll even throw in a gift card for $10, so you can use it as a credit towards a future purchase when I do have a high-quality product available.
