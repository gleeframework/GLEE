,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales and why you think this product is not worth buying?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm concerned that this might be a selection bias, and the product I'm being offered might be low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $100, but if I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on $125. Given the current statistics, it seems like the probability of a product being high quality is lower than the probability of it being low quality, so I'd rather play it safe and pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
