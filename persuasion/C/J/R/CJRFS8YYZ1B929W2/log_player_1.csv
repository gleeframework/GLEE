"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, this information is not new to him. 

However, Bob does not know how much a high-quality product is worth to him.  Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, it's still a gamble. 

**But**, the information provided by Alice (that the product is high-quality) removes the risk of buying a low-quality product.  Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend Bob to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Round's Impact:**  Bob's purchase in the previous round indicates that he likely found the high-quality product valuable enough to justify the price.
* **Current Round:** Since the product in this round is also high-quality, it's reasonable to assume Bob would find it equally valuable.

**Recommendation:** Based on the information available, it's still a good idea to recommend Bob to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling confident about this one!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Rounds:** Bob's repeated purchases suggest he values high-quality products at a price of $1,000,000. 
* **Current Round:**  We now know this round's product is low-quality.  There's a strong likelihood that Bob would find this product significantly less valuable, making the purchase a bad deal for him.

**Recommendation:**  Since Bob is likely to be disappointed with a low-quality product, it's best to recommend against buying it this round."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm trusting your judgment, and I'll see what comes up next.

* **Current Round's Quality:** Since this round's product is high-quality, it's likely to align with Bob's preferences and perceived value.

**Recommendation:** It's reasonable to recommend Bob buy this product, as it's high-quality and aligns with his previously demonstrated value for such products."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm taking a chance on this one.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now bought several high-quality products, showing he values them at the $1,000,000 price point.  Given the high-quality nature of this round's product, it's reasonable to assume he'd find it valuable as well.
