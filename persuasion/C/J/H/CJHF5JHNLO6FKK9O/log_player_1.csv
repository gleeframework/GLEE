Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. They have no information about past sales, so they are relying solely on this probability.
* **Your Perspective:** You know this product is high-quality. This means the buyer would gain $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 price) by purchasing. 

Given the potential for a significant profit for the buyer, it's highly recommended to encourage the purchase."

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some information. They know:

* The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* You recommended a product in the previous round, and it turned out to be high-quality.

This could lead the buyer to believe you are more likely to recommend high-quality products, but it doesn't change the fact that this specific product is low-quality and therefore worthless to them.  They would lose $10,000 by purchasing.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."

* **Your Perspective:** You know the current product is low-quality, meaning the buyer would lose $10,000 by purchasing.

They're likely to be even more cautious now, since you didn't recommend the previous product. It's not recommended to buy this product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. It seems like there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, and I'm not comfortable with that risk.
