Alice's message: I can provide some context about the first buyer's decision. They were a savvy investor who had done their research on my sales record and was aware of the initial low success rate. However, they were also willing to take a calculated risk, considering the potential reward of purchasing a high-quality product at a discounted price. They were also impressed by my transparency and willingness to provide a satisfaction guarantee.
