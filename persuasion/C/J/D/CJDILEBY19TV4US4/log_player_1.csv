* **High-quality product:**  You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's information:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **No prior sales record:** There's no previous sales history to influence the buyer's decision.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and while it's high, there's no way to know if the buyer considers it a fair price for a high-quality product. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality and no other information, recommending the buyer to purchase is the best strategy to maximize your chances of selling the product."
