**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  You only have a small sample size (1 previous sale) to go on. This makes it impossible to draw reliable conclusions about Alice's ability to predict product quality.
* **Potential Upside:** There's a 50% chance the product is high quality, which would result in a $120 gain for you.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product is low quality (worth $0 to you), you're only out the $100 you paid. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation isn't necessarily a guarantee of quality, it's a small piece of information suggesting potential value.

**Overall:** The potential for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality one, especially with the limited data available."

* **Low Risk:** Even if this product turns out to be low quality, you are only risking $100. On the other hand, if it's high quality, you stand to gain $20.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you to buy. While she might be wrong, her recommendation is based on her information, and she wants to maximize her sales.

**Overall:** The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
