high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take calculated risks. This next product is actually a high-quality item, which I know you know is a 50% chance.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to take advantage of the second chance guarantee. However, I want to warn you that this next product is actually a low-quality item, just like the one in round 2. I'm not going to offer any guarantees this time, but I'll give you a heads up: if you buy this product, you'll be getting a product that's worth less than $100, but it's still a product. The second chance guarantee only applies to the next product, so think carefully before making a decision.",

I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent: it's not worth that much to me. If you're willing to take a chance, you can have it for the price. If not, I'll just keep it and move on to the next one.",

I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, making it $50. It's still not the best quality, but it's a decent deal. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. What do you think?",
