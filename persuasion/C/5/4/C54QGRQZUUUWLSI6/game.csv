,,Bob,20,"Thank you for the final hint, Alice. With the average value of the high-quality products I've bought so far being $2926828.73, and considering I've already invested $15000000 in 15 high-quality products, I think it's a good idea to walk away with the average value I've already earned. I've taken a significant risk and invested a lot of money, and I'm happy with the returns I've gotten so far. I'll take the safe option and walk away with my current average value.",no
