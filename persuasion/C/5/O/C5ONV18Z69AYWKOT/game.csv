,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a red flag and the recommendation from Alice is likely influenced by the fact that she wants to sell the product. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the remaining products might be more likely to be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold? I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current data.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, Alice. Is it because you've had a string of low-quality products so far?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality as well. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it seems like the odds are against me. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and still purchased the product. This suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since you haven't recommended it, it's more likely to be low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Your recommendation reinforces my skepticism, so I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.
