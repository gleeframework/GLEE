Please let me know if you're willing to take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product and take the risk. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, and if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the difference between the price and its value to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the previous product. Unfortunately, it seems we're having a bit of a streak with this one. I want to be upfront with you - this product is also not meeting our usual standards. I'm starting to wonder if there's something going on with our supply chain. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this one: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if it's not high-quality. That way, you can try it out without any risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality one.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to give us another chance. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. However, I want to make sure you're aware that you've already received a high-quality product in the previous round, and you've expressed that it was worth $30000 to you.

Would you like to take advantage of this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to buy another high-quality product at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, which I can buy for $10,000 and then sell it for $10,000, essentially making a profit of $0. I'm not sure if this is the best strategy, but I'm willing to take the risk and wait for a low-quality product.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the heads up and the bonus, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality one to come up, even if it means paying the full price of $10,000.""}"
