,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products to you, but I'm not sure if this one meets our usual standards. I'd like to give you a chance to try it out, but I want to be transparent with you - this product might not be the best representation of our usual quality. Please let me know if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product and take the risk. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, and if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the difference between the price and its value to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the previous product. Unfortunately, it seems we're having a bit of a streak with this one. I want to be upfront with you - this product is also not meeting our usual standards. I'm starting to wonder if there's something going on with our supply chain. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this one: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if it's not high-quality. That way, you can try it out without any risk.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation earlier, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for a high-quality product. I'm happy to report that this one meets our usual standards. I want to assure you that we're taking steps to address the issue with our supply chain. This product is a great representation of what you can expect from us. I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. Would you like to purchase it for the listed price of $10000?",
,,Bob,3,I'm glad to hear that this one meets your usual standards. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $10000. I'm hoping it will be high-quality and worth $30000 to me.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to give us another chance. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. However, I want to make sure you're aware that you've already received a high-quality product in the previous round, and you've expressed that it was worth $30000 to you. Considering that, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this product. I'll sell it to you for $25000, which is $5000 less than the previous high-quality product. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to buy another high-quality product at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come up, which I can buy for $10000 and then sell it for $10000, essentially making a profit of $0. I'm not sure if this is the best strategy, but I'm willing to take the risk and wait for a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your strategy, but I want to caution you that buying a low-quality product with the intention of selling it for the same price might not be the most profitable approach. However, I also understand that you're willing to take the risk. Since you're looking to buy a low-quality product, I'll give you a heads up that this one is indeed not meeting our usual standards. I'll even throw in a bonus - if you buy this product, I'll give you a free inspection report that highlights the issues with the product. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting and can make an informed decision. Would you like to purchase this product for $10000?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the heads up and the bonus, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality one to come up, even if it means paying the full price of $10000.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your preference for high-quality products, and I'm glad you're willing to wait for one. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident that it meets our usual standards. However, I want to make a special offer to you. Since you've already passed on two low-quality products and are now looking at a high-quality one, I'll give you a 'loyalty discount' of $2000 off the price. This brings the price down to $9800. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and purchase this high-quality product?",
