Round 2
Alice's message: You got a great deal on the first product! Since you're willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price. However, I want to make it clear that the quality of this product is not guaranteed, and there's a 20% chance it might be low-quality. If you're willing to take that risk, I'll sell it to you for $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at the same price as the first one.""}"

If you buy it now, I'll sell it to you for $90, which is a 10% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer another high-quality product at this price in the future.

However, this time, I'll make it a 'best offer' deal: if you buy it now, I'll not only give you the product, but I'll also give you the option to return it for a full refund if you're not satisfied with its value. You can essentially 'try before you buy' and see if it's worth the $90 to you.

Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous deals! However, I have to warn you that this product is not as good as the previous ones. It's a lower-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you at the same price of $100 because I want to clear out my inventory. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, but I need to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. If you're looking for a bargain, this might be a good opportunity, but if you're looking for a high-quality item, you might want to consider passing on this one.
