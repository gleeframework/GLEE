As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I've observed that the last product I offered was low-quality, and the one before that was high-quality. This suggests that the next product might be high-quality as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value. If you're willing to take the chance, please respond with 'yes'.",
