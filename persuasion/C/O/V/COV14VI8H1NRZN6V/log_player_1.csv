Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though the current product is high-quality, there's no reason to change the strategy.  The buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.  Since you're selling at a fixed price of $100, and the buyer knows the product is worth $400 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality, they're still unlikely to buy.  

There's no benefit to changing your strategy at this point. The buyer is unlikely to buy without seeing evidence of high-quality products in your sales record."
