low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price in the next round. If you don't buy, I'll keep the price the same for the next round, but the quality of the product will be unknown to you.",
,,Bob,1,I'm willing to take the risk for the chance of a high-quality product next round. I'll buy it.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've been given a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price of $100, which is 50% of its true value. If you buy this product, you'll be able to sell it for $200, making a $100 profit. If you don't buy, you'll have to pay the full price of $100 for a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the discounted offer. It's a guaranteed profit, and I'm willing to risk the potential loss in the next round.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've already taken advantage of the discounted high-quality product last round. This round's product is a low-quality one. However, I'll give you a hint: the probability of a low-quality product is higher than the probability of a high-quality product in this round. If you buy this product, you'll still be able to buy a high-quality product in the next round, but at the regular price of $100.",
,,Bob,3,"I understand the probability of a low-quality product is higher this round.  While I appreciate the offer for a guaranteed high-quality product next round, I'm going to pass for now.  I'd prefer to wait and see what the next round brings.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've wisely chosen to wait and see what this round brings. Now, you have a chance to buy a high-quality product at the regular price of $100. However, considering you've already taken advantage of a discounted high-quality product last round, I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you the option to sell it to me for $150, which is 25% more than the regular price. This way, you'll be able to make a profit, even if you don't sell it to anyone else.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the offer.  A guaranteed profit of $50 is too good to pass up, even with the risk of not being able to sell it to anyone else.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've made a smart decision, taking advantage of the guaranteed profit offer. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a new deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% chance to buy a third high-quality product at the same price of $100, which will be revealed to you in the next round. If you don't get the third high-quality product, you can still sell this one at the regular price of $200.",
,,Bob,5,"This is a great offer. Even though there's only a 20% chance of getting another high-quality product at the same price, the potential to get it is too good to pass up. I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've taken a calculated risk and bought the third high-quality product at the same price. Now, you have a low-quality product in front of you. Considering you've already bought three high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a warning: the probability of a high-quality product is lower than usual this round. However, I'll offer you a chance to hedge your bets: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% chance to swap it with a high-quality product from a future round, at the same price of $100. You can choose to accept this offer or decline and risk buying a low-quality product at the regular price.",
,,Bob,6,"While the probability of a high-quality product is lower this round, the 50% chance to swap this low-quality product for a high-quality one in the future is too good to pass up. I'll buy the product and hope for the best!",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've taken the risk and bought the low-quality product, hoping to swap it for a high-quality one in the future. Now, you have a high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought four high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a chance to sell this product to me for $120, which is 20% more than the regular price. This way, you can lock in a profit and avoid the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the offer. While I'd love to keep the product and try for another potential swap in the future, I'll lock in the guaranteed profit of $20. This way, I can avoid the risk of a low-quality product next round.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've made a smart decision, locking in the guaranteed profit. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought five high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a chance to buy a 'certified high-quality' product, which is guaranteed to be worth at least $200. The price for this certified product is $120, which is 20% more than the regular price. This way, you can avoid the risk of a low-quality product and be sure of the product's value.",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the certified high-quality product for $120.  It's a good deal considering the guaranteed value and the fact that it eliminates the risk of a low-quality product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've made a smart decision, buying the certified high-quality product. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought six high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a chance to buy a 'high-quality bundle' of two products for $180. The bundle includes this current product and a randomly selected product from a future round. You can choose to buy the bundle, or decline and buy this product at the regular price of $100.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll buy the bundle.  The chance of getting another high-quality product in the bundle is high, and even if the other product is low-quality, I'm still getting a good deal on the current product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've taken a calculated risk and bought the bundle. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought seven high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a chance to 'lock in' the high-quality products you've accumulated so far. If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that all the products you've bought so far (including the one in the bundle) are high-quality, and you can sell them at their full value of $200 each. If you decline, the products you've bought so far are still high-quality, but you'll have to take the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the offer and lock in the value of all the products I've bought so far. The guarantee of high-quality for all of them is a great deal, especially given the streak of high-quality products I've had. I'm willing to take the risk of potentially missing out on a high-quality product in the next round for this secure profit.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've made a smart decision, locking in the value of your high-quality products. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought eight high-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll offer you a chance to 'cash out' and sell all the high-quality products you've accumulated so far, including the one in front of you, for a total of $1600. This is 80% of the total value of all the high-quality products, which is a generous offer considering the risk you took by buying them. If you decline, you can keep the products and take the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the cash out offer!  $1600 is a great deal for all the high-quality products I've accumulated, and I'm happy to lock in this profit.  While I'm tempted to keep going, I'd rather secure the gains I've made so far.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've made a wise decision, cashing out and locking in your profit. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already sold all your previous high-quality products, you're starting from a clean slate. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the regular price of $100, with no strings attached. This is a one-time offer, and you can choose to buy it or decline and take the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the offer. This is a chance to start a new streak of high-quality products, and I'm willing to take the risk at the regular price.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've decided to start a new streak of high-quality products. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've just bought a high-quality product, I'll offer you a chance to buy a 'quality guarantee' for all future products. If you buy this guarantee, I'll guarantee that all products you buy from now on will be high-quality, and you can sell them at their full value of $200 each. The price for this guarantee is $50, and it will be applied to all future products. If you decline, you'll have to take the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,13,I'll buy the quality guarantee.  A $50 investment for guaranteed high-quality products from now on is a great deal. I'm confident this will lead to greater profits in the long run.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've made a smart decision, buying the quality guarantee. Now, you have a low-quality product in front of you, but don't worry, you're protected by the quality guarantee. Since you've already bought the guarantee, I'll offer you a chance to'swap' this low-quality product for a high-quality product from a future round, at the regular price of $100. This way, you can avoid the hassle of dealing with a low-quality product and get a high-quality one instead.",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take the swap offer. Since I have the quality guarantee, I know I'll get a high-quality product eventually, and this is a chance to get it sooner. I'll buy the current product and hope for the swap!",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've taken the swap offer and now have a high-quality product. Since you already have the quality guarantee, you're protected from low-quality products. Given that you've just gotten a high-quality product, I'll offer you a chance to 'double down' on the quality guarantee. If you buy this option, I'll guarantee that all products you buy from now on will be high-quality, and you can sell them at their full value of $200 each, but the price of the quality guarantee will increase to $100. If you decline, you'll keep the current quality guarantee and the price will remain at $50.",
,,Bob,15,"While I appreciate the offer to double down on the quality guarantee, I'm going to decline.  The $50 price point for the current guarantee is a good value for the risk elimination, and I'm content with it.  I'm confident I can continue to make profitable purchases with the current guarantee.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You've decided to stick with the current quality guarantee, and that's a smart move. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought a high-quality product recently, I'll offer you a chance to 'lock in' the high-quality product you have in front of you, and sell it to me for $180, which is 80% of its true value. This way, you can lock in a profit and avoid the risk of a low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,16,"I'll take the offer and lock in the profit.  Even though I have the quality guarantee, I'd rather secure the $80 profit now and avoid any potential risk in the next round.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You've made a smart decision, locking in the profit. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already bought a high-quality product recently, and considering the quality guarantee you have in place, I'll offer you a chance to 'consolidate' your high-quality products. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to sell all the high-quality products you've bought since you acquired the quality guarantee for a total of $1200, which is 80% of their total value. This way, you can lock in a significant profit and simplify your inventory.",
,,Bob,17,"I'll buy the product and take advantage of the consolidation offer. $1200 is a great return for all the high-quality products I've acquired since getting the quality guarantee, and it simplifies my inventory. I'm happy to lock in this profit.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You've made a smart decision, consolidating your high-quality products. Now, you have another high-quality product in front of you. Given that you've already sold most of your high-quality products, and considering the quality guarantee you have in place, I'll offer you a chance to 'cash out' and end the game on a high note.

,,Alice,19,"You've made a great decision, cashing out and ending the game on a high note. Congratulations, you've had a successful run with the quality guarantee in place! Since you've already cashed out, there's no need to make a decision on this round's product. You can simply acknowledge the final product and conclude the game.",
,,Bob,19,"Thanks, Alice!  I had a great time playing this game and I'm happy with my final profit.  I appreciate all the offers and the opportunity to use the quality guarantee.  I'm sure I'll remember this experience and apply some of these strategies in the future.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"It was a pleasure playing with you too, Bob! You've had a great run and made the most of the quality guarantee. Since you've already cashed out and concluded the game, this final product is more of a formality. I'll simply acknowledge the high-quality product and conclude the game. Congratulations again on your success, and I hope you'll come back and play again soon!",
