**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  4 out of 4 products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product to you.  Therefore, her recommendation is likely based on her knowledge that this specific product is high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting $0.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information given in the game setup. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional factors like trust in the seller, the possibility of getting a refund, and your overall risk tolerance."

**Explanation:**

* **Sales data:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This is extremely unusual given the 80/20 probability.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

Therefore, given the information available, the best decision is to buy the product."
