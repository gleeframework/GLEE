Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in making a bet that could potentially cost me $100. I'll stick to my strategy of waiting for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if I get a coupon for a high-quality product in the future. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $100.""}"
