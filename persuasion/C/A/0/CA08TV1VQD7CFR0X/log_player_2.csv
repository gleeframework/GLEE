**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the sales history is limited, the fact that one high-quality product was sold suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend good products.
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight. Since she knows the true value of the product, her recommendation implies it's likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**It's important to note that this is a risky decision based on limited information. However, the potential reward and Alice's recommendation make it a reasonable gamble.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  3 out of 3 products sold have been high quality. This suggests a very strong bias towards high-quality products, even though Alice knows the actual value of each product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the value of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight. She would likely not recommend a product unless she was confident it was high-quality. 

While the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product exists, the overwhelming evidence suggests this product is likely high-quality."
