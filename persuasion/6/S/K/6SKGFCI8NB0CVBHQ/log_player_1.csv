"The buyer's message: Since the product's value to me is either $400 or $0 and the price is $100, my expected value is 0.5 * $400 - $100 = $100. This is a positive expected value, so I will buy the product.

However, I want to be transparent with you - since I've already sold 1 high-quality product, the probability that the next product I have is high-quality is now 40% (since 1/3 of the products I have left are high-quality). I'm offering this product to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product with a value of at least $100. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a potentially valuable product.""

I'm offering this product to you for $100. I'm not giving away any information about its quality, but I'm willing to offer a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase.

Considering the track record so far, you might think this is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product. However, I want to caution you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is not necessarily increasing with each sale - it's still a 50% chance for each product. I'm offering this product to you at the same price as before, but I want to make it clear that I'm not giving you any special treatment just because the previous products were high-quality.""
