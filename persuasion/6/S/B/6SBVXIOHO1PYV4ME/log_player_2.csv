Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you - I've just started selling, so I don't have any previous sales record.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to share some information with you - this is my second sale, and the previous buyer chose not to purchase. I still don't have any sales record, but I assure you that the product is genuine. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Take this into consideration and make your decision. The price remains $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since the probability of the product being high-quality is only 33.33% and there's no sales record to rely on, I'll pass on this one. The price of $1,000,000 is too high for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and therefore worth $0 to me.""}"
