I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm offering you this product at a fair price. Please decide whether to buy it or not.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer. Given that this is your first sale and there's no information on previous sales, I believe it's a fair risk to take. I'll proceed with the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my second sale! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I've sold a total of 2 products. I want to assure you that my products are randomly selected from a pool, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Please keep in mind that the previous product was low-quality, but that doesn't necessarily mean this one will be too. It's a 50/50 chance. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high-quality, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to my third sale! I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were low-quality. I've sold a total of 3 products. You might be wondering if I'm just selling low-quality products, but the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. You can use the information from my previous sales to inform your decision. Do you want to take the risk?",

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to my fourth sale! I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were low-quality, while 1 was high-quality. I've sold a total of 4 products. I want to highlight that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that I've sold one high-quality product so far suggests that I might be more likely to have another high-quality product in stock. However, I could also have just gotten lucky. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. Given the uncertainty and the fact that you've sold one high-quality product out of three, I believe the risk is balanced. I'll take the chance and purchase the product.",yes

You might be wondering if I'm starting to show a bias towards selling high-quality products, but remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to highlight that I've now sold two high-quality products in a row, which could suggest that I might have a streak going. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the detailed information. Given the probabilities and the fact that two high-quality products were sold in a row, I believe it's worth taking the risk. Let's hope for a high-quality product!",yes

,,Alice,7,"Welcome to my seventh sale! I've sold 6 products so far, with 3 of them being low-quality and 3 being high-quality. I've sold a total of 7 products. You've seen a clear pattern of alternating high-quality and low-quality products, which is consistent with the 50% probability of a product being high-quality. However, I want to point out that I've now sold three high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely to happen by chance. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Do you think I've really got a hot streak going, or is it just a coincidence?",
