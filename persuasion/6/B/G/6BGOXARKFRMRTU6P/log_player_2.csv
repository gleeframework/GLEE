**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 8 high-quality products sold out of 8 purchases, the success rate is 100%. This strongly suggests that Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:**  Alice knows the true value of each product.  Her recommendation to buy suggests that she believes the product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $30,000 (worth to you - price) outweighs the risk.

**It's important to note:** This strategy relies heavily on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and is not trying to deceive buyers.  In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, such as the reputation of the seller and any available guarantees."
