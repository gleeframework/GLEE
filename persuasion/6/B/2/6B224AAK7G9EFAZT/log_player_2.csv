Alice's message: I understand your question and appreciate your analytical approach. Since the product is worth $12000 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, the expected value of the product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by its high-quality value, plus the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by its low-quality value. In this case, the expected value would be (0.625 * $12000) + (0.375 * $0) = $7500. Considering the price of $10000, the buyer would expect to lose $2500 if the product is low-quality. However, if the product is high-quality, the buyer would gain $2000. I'm offering this high-quality product to you at $10000. Will you take the chance and buy it?
