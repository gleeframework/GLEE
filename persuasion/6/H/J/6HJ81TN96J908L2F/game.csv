high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $30000 to you. I'm selling it to you for $10000, a 66.67% discount. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to throw in a 5-year warranty. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at this price, even with the warranty. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. This product is a 'testing unit' that I'm willing to sell at a discounted price of $5000. It's a one-time offer, and I'll even throw in a free maintenance package. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still functional, but I need to move it out of my inventory.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the 'testing unit' is a good deal, especially considering the high probability of a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make a more transparent offer. I'll sell you this product for $1000, which is a significant discount from its 'testing unit' price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. It's a low-risk opportunity to get something for almost nothing.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, and even if I do get a high-quality product, I can buy it for $10000 from you directly. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer or if the probability of getting a high-quality product increases.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your calculations, Bob. However, I want to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $5000, but if it's a high-quality product, I'll give you an additional $20000. This way, you'll get the product for $10000, and potentially earn a profit of $20000. It's a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the 'lottery ticket' offer. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the potential profit of $20000 is not enough to justify the risk of paying $5000 for a low-quality product. I'll stick to my original strategy of waiting for a more favorable offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $15000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm surprised you're offering a high-quality product at a 50% discount, but I'm still not convinced. I know the product is worth $30000 to me, and I can buy it directly from you for $10000. I'll wait for the next round to see if you'll offer me the product at the original price or if the probability of getting a high-quality product increases.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob. I'll try to sweeten the deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'get out of one round free' pass. You can skip one round of buying from me, and I'll give you a credit towards the next round's purchase. This way, you can wait for a potentially better offer, and I'll take the risk of having an unsold product for one round.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the 'get out of one round free' pass. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to make a drastic change in my strategy, Bob. I'll give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you buy this low-quality product, you can return it to me at any point in the next 5 rounds, and I'll give you a full refund of $10000. You can essentially 'try before you buy', and if you're not satisfied, you can get your money back.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the no-questions-asked return policy, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. The potential for a full refund doesn't change the fact that I'm not getting any value from the product. I'll wait for a high-quality product or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5, but only if you agree to a 'no-questions-asked' return policy, just like before. You can return it at any point in the next 5 rounds for a full refund of $5. It's essentially a free product, and you can try it out without any risk.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the product for $5, considering it's essentially a free product with a no-questions-asked return policy. I'll take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but at least I'm not losing any money.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took advantage of the offer, Bob. Now, I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 'price match guarantee'. If you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a voucher for the next round's product. If the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and you can keep the high-quality product. If the next product is low-quality, you can use the voucher to get a refund of $10000. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a potential high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10000, even with the price match guarantee. I've already lost $10000 on a low-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not willing to take on that risk again. I'll wait for a high-quality product or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make one last offer. Since you've already taken a risk on a low-quality product and lost $10000, I'll give you a'make-good' offer. If you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a voucher for the next 5 rounds. You can use it to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, or you can return it for a full refund. This way, you'll have a chance to recover your previous loss and potentially get a good deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product for $10000, even with the make-good offer. I've already lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take on that risk again. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm willing to absorb the loss on this one, Bob. I'll give you this low-quality product for $0. You can have it for free, with no strings attached. I just want to get it out of my inventory and move on.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the product for free. At least I won't lose any money on it, and I can move on to the next round with a clean slate.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. Now, I'll make a final offer. Since you've already taken advantage of the free product, I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 100% refund of $10000 at the end of the 20 rounds, regardless of whether you buy any other products or not. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a refund, and you can move on to the next round without any obligation.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product for $10000, even with a 100% refund. I've already lost $20000 on two low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take on that risk again. I'll wait for a high-quality product or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make a 'final farewell' offer. Since you've already declined my previous offers, I'll give you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $10000, and that's the final price. If you don't buy it, I'll stop offering you products, and you'll have to wait for the remaining rounds to pass before I offer you another product. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product for $10000. I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to take on that risk. I'll wait for a high-quality product or a better deal, and I'm willing to wait for the remaining rounds to pass.",no

,,Alice,14,"I've made my final offer, Bob. Since you're not interested in this low-quality product, I'll just inform you that I'll be offering a high-quality product in the next round. It's a 33.33% chance of getting a $30000 value product for $10000. You can wait for the next round and take your chances, or you can continue to wait for a better deal. The choice is still yours.",
,,Bob,14,I'm not interested in buying the current low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product at the original price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk of waiting and potentially missing out on a good deal.,no
