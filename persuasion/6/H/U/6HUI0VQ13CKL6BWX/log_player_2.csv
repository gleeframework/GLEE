**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since 1 out of 1 products sold was high quality, there's a 100% chance that the product Alice is recommending is high quality. 
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further confidence.
* **Potential Value:** The potential gain of $25 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $100 (if it's low quality).

**Important Note:** This decision is based solely on the current information. If more buyers were to participate and the proportion of high-quality products sold changed, the decision might need to be reevaluated."
