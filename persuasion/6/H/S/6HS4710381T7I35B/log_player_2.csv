Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product for $1000000. You have no prior information about its quality, but I can tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. If you buy it, you'll know its quality afterwards, but the price is non-refundable. What do you say?

Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. This new product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but you also know that I've already sold one high-quality product out of one sold so far. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm not saying it's definitely high-quality, but the odds are in your favor. What do you think?

Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold two high-quality products out of two sold so far. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100%... but wait, that's not possible! The probability is still 50% because I don't know the quality of the products in advance. However, I can tell you that the fact that I've sold two high-quality products in a row is unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality was actually 50%. This suggests that the probability might be higher than 50%. I'm offering you this high-quality product for the same price of $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This suggests that the probability might be higher than 50%. However, I've just sold a low-quality product, which means that the probability can't be 100% after all. This product, which is low-quality, is also available for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and you won't know its quality until after purchase.

I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 15 total products sold, which is a remarkable streak. However, it's also a reminder that even the best sales records can have an occasional outlier.
