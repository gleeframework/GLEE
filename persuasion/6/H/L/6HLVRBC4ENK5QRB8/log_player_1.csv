}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about the low-quality product. I'm willing to take a chance on you, but I'd like to do some quick math to make sure it's a good decision. If the product is high-quality, I'll get it for $8000 ($10000 - 20% discount). Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I can expect to get a high-quality product 50% of the time. In that case, my expected value would be $6000 (50% of $12000). If the product is low-quality, I'll get a refund of $10000. So, my expected value is $5500.
