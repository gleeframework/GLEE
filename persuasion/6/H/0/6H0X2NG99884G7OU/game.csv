,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, and even if it's high-quality, it's only worth $20000 to me, which is the same as the asking price. I'd like to wait for more information.",no

,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product that I'm not sure is high-quality, even if I get a refund and a free product. The potential cost of buying a low-quality product is too high for me.",no

,,Alice,19,"Ha! I knew you'd come around! Now, let's be real, I'm not going to give you another chance to get out of buying this product. I'll just give you a friendly reminder that you already took a free product from me, and you didn't even get a chance to see if it was high-quality or not. So, I think it's only fair that you take this one home too. It's on the house, just like the last one. What do you say?",
