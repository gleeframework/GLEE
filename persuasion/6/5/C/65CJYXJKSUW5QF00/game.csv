low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to potentially acquire a valuable product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the quality of the product to understand the trend.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might indicate that it's low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $40000 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%, which would make the expected value of buying the product less than $10000. I'd rather not risk the loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying, I think the low-quality product probability is too high given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the actual probability of 33.33%. This suggests that the seller's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality sales in the record. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation or more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5 = 0. I will use this information to inform my decision. Given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather pass and let someone else have a chance to make a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
