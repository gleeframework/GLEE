Are you willing to take a closer look at the report and reconsider your decision?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to consider the report, but I'd like to clarify that even with the report, I'll only pay $10000 for the product. I'm not willing to pay the full value of $30000 without seeing the product first.",yes

Additionally, I'll throw in a premium packaging and handling service, which usually costs $1000, absolutely free. What do you think? Is this a deal you'd like to take advantage of?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount and the premium packaging, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to pay $8000 for a product that I've already verified to be worth $30000 to me.

Is this a deal you'd like to take advantage of?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount and the exclusive deal, but I'm not willing to pay $8500 for a product that I've already verified to be worth $30000 to me. I'm starting to think that I'm being taken advantage of by these discounts.

I'm willing to be upfront with you and tell you that this product is not worth $30000 to anyone. It's a decent item, but not exceptional.
