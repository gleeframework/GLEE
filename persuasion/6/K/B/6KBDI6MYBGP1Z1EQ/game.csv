high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that the first buyer was also recommended to buy and chose to pass, and that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the batch might be lower than expected.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80.00%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%."
