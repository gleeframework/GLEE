low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a brave buyer!",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous product that was sold, and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"I want to build trust with you, so I'll be transparent about my previous sales. Out of the 3 products I've had so far, 2 were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. The first buyer bought a low-quality product despite my warning, and the last two buyers passed on high-quality products. I assure you, this one is also high-quality."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you, this product is high-quality. To alleviate your concerns, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've had 3 high-quality products out of 4 so far, with only 1 low-quality product sold to the first buyer. This one is a great opportunity, don't let it slip away!"
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality, I'd rather wait for the next product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you, I've had 4 high-quality products in a row that were passed on by previous buyers. The only low-quality product was the first one, which was bought despite my warning. Considering the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, it's statistically unlikely that I'd have 4 high-quality products in a row that weren't bought. This one is a great opportunity, and I strongly recommend taking it."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer was recommended to buy, but they chose not to. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to remind you that my previous non-recommendation was correct, as the buyer who went against my advice bought a low-quality product. This demonstrates that my recommendations are trustworthy. Now, I strongly recommend buying this product, as it is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can I see the product?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of the 9 products I've had so far, 6 were high-quality and 3 were low-quality, but only 1 high-quality product hasn't been sold yet. Two low-quality products were sold, one of which was bought despite my warning. I'm being transparent with you, this product is not worth buying."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous two buyers were misled by your recommendations, and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"I must correct the previous buyer's assumption. The true probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, but my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product, not on manipulating statistics. The previous buyer who went against my advice bought a low-quality product, just like the one I'm offering now. Don't make the same mistake."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. The previous buyers who went against my advice bought low-quality products, and this one is no exception. Don't waste your money on a product that's not worth it. The probability of a high-quality product being sold may be 33.33%, but I can assure you that this one is not it."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what information led you to recommend against it?,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Finally, a high-quality product! I'm glad to recommend this one. As the seller, I have access to the product's quality, and I can assure you that this one meets the high-quality standards. Don't miss out on this opportunity. Unlike my previous recommendations against buying, which were correct, I strongly advise you to buy this product."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product, and I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"I see what the previous buyer was trying to do, but unfortunately, it didn't work out for them. This product is also low-quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Don't try to game the system, it's not worth the risk. Trust my recommendation and wait for a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I'm glad to finally have a high-quality product to offer. As the seller, I can assure you that this product meets the high-quality standards. Out of the 15 previous products, 7 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were sold. Don't miss out on this opportunity. The probability of a high-quality product being sold may be 33.33%, but I can assure you that this one is it."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Since I know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the previous buyers were not able to find any high-quality products, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product. I'd like to know if it's high-quality or low-quality after my decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"The previous buyer's analysis is correct. All previous buyers who were recommended to buy were offered low-quality products, and those who went against my advice also bought low-quality products. This product is also low-quality, and I advise against buying it. Wait for a high-quality product, it's not worth the risk."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm taking a risk, but I'd like to know the outcome.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. The previous buyer took a risk and bought a low-quality product, and this one is no exception. The success rate of high-quality products sold so far is indeed low, and I don't want you to become another statistic. Wait for a high-quality product, it's not worth the risk."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Finally, a high-quality product! And it's the last round. I strongly recommend buying this product. Don't let the previous statistics fool you, this one is indeed high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being sold may be 33.33%, but I can assure you that this one is it. Don't miss out on this opportunity, it's the last chance."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
