**Reasoning:**

* You know the product is high-quality, worth $120 to the buyer.
* You are selling it for $100.
* The buyer is rational and will buy if the expected value is positive.
* Expected value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60 
* Since the expected value is positive ($60), it makes sense to recommend buying."

* While this doesn't change the actual probability of this specific product, it might increase the buyer's confidence. 
* The expected value remains the same: (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60.
