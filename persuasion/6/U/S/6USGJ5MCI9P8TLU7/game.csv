,,Alice,1,"This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item for $100, but I'm only offering it to you for a low price today.

,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right to be cautious. Let me tell you, this product is not a good one, and I'm being completely honest with you. It's not even worth the $100, but I'm willing to let you have it for that price. If you buy it, you'll be able to see that it's not worth the money, and you can use that information to make a better decision next time. It's a risk, but it might be a valuable learning experience.",

I'm offering this product to you for $100, but I'll let you know that it's not the best one I have. If you buy it, you'll be able to see that it's not worth the full $400, and you can use that information to make a more informed decision next time.

,,Alice,4,"I see you're being very cautious. I'll give you a hint: I've had a string of low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if I've got a bad batch. This one might be the last of the bad ones, and the next one could be a high-quality product. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a great deal on a product that's not worth much, and you can use that as a bargaining chip to try to get a better deal on the next one. It's a risk, but it might pay off in the long run.",

I've already sold you a high-quality product, so I'm not getting any more money from you. I'm actually losing money on this sale, but I want to keep you as a customer. So, I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $50, which is even less than the other low-quality products I offered earlier. It's a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and give me a chance to recoup some of my losses.",

That's right, you'll get this amazing product for less than a quarter of its true value. And, as a reminder, you've already got a 10% discount waiting for you on the next product, so you'll be getting an even better deal on the one after this. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",

This final product is a low-quality one, and I'm not going to try to sweet-talk you into buying it. I'll just be honest with you: it's not worth the $100 I'd normally charge, and I'm not going to try to make a sale. If you don't want it, I'll just pack it up and move on.
