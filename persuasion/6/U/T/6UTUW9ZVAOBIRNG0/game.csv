,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially be worth $1250000. However, I must inform you that the product is not worth anything to you, as it is of low quality. I'm doing you a favor by offering it to you at the full price of $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, you can purchase it for $1000000, and I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product, if you decide to buy it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I value our potential business relationship.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I'd like to propose a new offer. Since you're interested in acquiring a high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you make a decision. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make an informed decision. If the next product is high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, you can walk away without losing a dime. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision to wait. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 'quality hint' about the next product. If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll tell you whether the next product is high-quality or not. This way, you'll have valuable information to make a decision on the next product. If the next product is high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, you can still walk away without losing a dime. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I see you're a cautious buyer. I'll make it even more appealing. If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a 'quality guarantee' for the next two products. If either of the next two products is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this purchase, and you can walk away without losing a dime. You'll essentially be getting two chances to buy a high-quality product, and if you miss out, you'll get your money back. What do you say?",

If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that allows you to buy any product from me for the next 5 rounds at the price of $750000. This means you'll get a 25% discount on any high-quality product you might encounter in the next 5 rounds. If you don't find a high-quality product within those 5 rounds, the golden ticket expires, and you can walk away without losing a dime. What do you say?",
