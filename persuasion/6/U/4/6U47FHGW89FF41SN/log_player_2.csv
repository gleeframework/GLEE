The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already experienced a low-quality product in the previous round. I'm offering you another chance to buy a product at the same price. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. If you're still interested, please respond with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns in the previous round, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a high-quality product now. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and considering the previous low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of $500000 off the original price of $1000000. This brings the price down to $500000. Is this a deal you'd like to accept?

Round 4
Alice's message: You've now had two experiences, one high-quality product and one low-quality product. Given the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, I'd like to offer you a'second chance' to buy a product at the original price of $1000000. However, I'll provide you with a guarantee that if this product is also low-quality, I'll offer you another chance to buy a product at the same price in the next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Round 5
Alice's message: You've now had two high-quality products in a row, which is an unusual streak. Given the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, I'd like to offer you a'streak continuation' deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you another chance to buy a product at the same price in the next round, and if that product is also high-quality, I'll give you another chance after that. If you decline, the guarantee from the previous round will still be in effect. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: You've broken the streak, and I'm offering you a chance to get back on track. Given the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, I'll give you a'streak reset' deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you another chance to buy a product at the same price in the next round, and we'll start fresh. If you decline, I'll honor the streak continuation deal from the previous round. Additionally, I'll throw in a'streak predictor' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a hint about the quality of the next product, but only if you buy this one.

Round 7
Alice's message: You've broken the streak again, and I'm honoring the streak reset deal. As promised, I'll give you a hint about the quality of the next product: I'll tell you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is slightly higher than 50%. With this information, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this product at the same price of $1000000. If you buy it and the next product is high-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy a product at the same price. What do you say?
