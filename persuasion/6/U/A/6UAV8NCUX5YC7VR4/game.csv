high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy but no high-quality products were sold. This suggests that the recommended products might be low-quality, and I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also considering the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
