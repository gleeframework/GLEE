,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take you up on the offer for the consultation, but I'd like to clarify that my decision to purchase is not solely based on the consultation. I'm also considering the statistics from your previous sales. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of a total of 1, I'm still uncertain about the overall quality of your products. I'd like to request more information about the total number of products you've sold, the number of low-quality products you've had, and the proportion of high-quality products you've sold in the past. This will help me make a more informed decision.",yes

However, I want to be transparent about the fact that I've had a few... 'learning experiences' in the past, which has led to the current product being a low-quality one. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $1000000, despite its quality. I believe that the price reflects its potential value, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident that you'll find a way to make it work. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're interested in learning more about my 'learning experiences'. I've had a few instances where I've sold products that didn't meet my usual standards. In one case, I was too hasty in my production process, and a batch of products didn't receive the necessary quality control checks. In another case, I used a new supplier that didn't meet my expectations. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons, and I've since implemented new quality control measures to ensure that my products meet the highest standards.
