Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold a total of 6 products, with 4 of them being high-quality.

This might suggest that the previous products were unusually good, and the next product might be closer to the expected quality. I'm offering you this product for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is actually 80%, not 100%. You might want to consider this before making a decision.
