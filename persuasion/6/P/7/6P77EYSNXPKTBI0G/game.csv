high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I understand that you don't have any information about the product's quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and find out if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 50% and the previous buyer didn't buy, which might indicate a low-quality product, but I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, so I'm taking a chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the previous 3 products before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the product before I make a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you please reveal the quality of the product after I make my decision?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation from you and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous 5 buyers were unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the expected 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, so the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality is likely lower than 50% given the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I think it's likely to be a low-quality product given the previous 7 buyers were all recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality."
