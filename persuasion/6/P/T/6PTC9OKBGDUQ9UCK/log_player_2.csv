Alice's message: Ah, you want to know the outcome of the first product? Well, I'll let you in on a little secret: it was indeed a high-quality product. The buyer who passed on it earlier was just being cautious, and now it's your chance to take advantage of this great opportunity. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold so far. This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I see you're thinking about the probability of the last 3 high-quality products being a coincidence. Let me break it down for you. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of 3 consecutive high-quality products is (0.5)^3 = 0.125, or 12.5%. This is indeed a low probability, but not impossible.
