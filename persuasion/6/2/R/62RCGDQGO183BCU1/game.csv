,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare and valuable item. I'm only selling it for $10000, a steal considering its true worth. If you're interested, I can give you a chance to own it for a fraction of its real value. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",

And now, with a low-quality product in a row, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just due for a streak of bad luck. To be honest, I'm not sure if this product is worth the risk. I'm only asking $10000, but I'm starting to think that's too high a price for something that might not be worth anything. If you're feeling generous, you could take it off my hands, but I wouldn't blame you if you walked away.",
