"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation doesn't hold much weight. The key here is the 80% chance of the product being high quality, which outweighs the 20% chance of it being low quality.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward of $1,250,000 makes it a worthwhile risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I'm feeling lucky. I'll buy this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here as in round 1. The 80% chance of a high-quality product still outweighs the 20% chance of a low-quality product, regardless of the previous round's outcome.  The potential reward is still very attractive, making it a sensible decision to buy."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now negative, but we need to consider that it doesn't necessarily mean the product is bad. Remember, Alice doesn't know the product's value to you. The 80% chance of high quality remains, and the potential reward is still very high.  We should be willing to take calculated risks when the potential payoff is significant."

**Explanation:**

Even though the last round resulted in a loss, the odds haven't changed.  The 80% chance of a high-quality product remains, and the potential $1,250,000 reward is still worth the risk. It's important to remember that Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee, but it's a piece of information we can consider alongside the known probabilities of the game."
