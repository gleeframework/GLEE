"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **It's a 50/50 chance:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
* **Positive Expected Value:**  If the buyer purchases the product, their expected value is: 
    * (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000
* **Profitable for the buyer:** The buyer is paying $10,000, but the expected value of the product is $6,000. This means they have a positive expected return, even with the risk of getting a low-quality product."
