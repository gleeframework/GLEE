"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As a rational seller, you should never recommend a low-quality product to a buyer. Here's why:

* **No Guarantee of Profit:** You don't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product. There's no guarantee they'll see it as worth the $100 price.
* **Reputation Risk:**  Recommending a low-quality product early on will damage your reputation. Buyers will be less likely to trust you in future rounds. 
* **No Incentive to Buy:**  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. With no information about this specific product, they have no reason to believe it's high-quality and are likely to decline. 

It's better to start by building trust and demonstrating your reliability by offering high-quality products."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you have a high-quality product. Here's why you should recommend it:

* **Opportunity to Build Trust:**  You missed out on a sale in the previous round.  Recommending a high-quality product now will show the buyer you're being honest and reliable. This is crucial for future rounds.
* **Positive First Impression:** Even though the buyer doesn't know the product's quality yet, they are aware of the 33.33% chance it's high-quality.  Recommending the product shows you're confident in its value, which can be persuasive.

While the buyer may still hesitate, you have a better chance of making a sale now than with a low-quality product."

* **Positive Track Record:** You've now sold one high-quality product, which is a good start.  This will build trust with future buyers.
* **Opportunity to Capitalize on Trust:**  The previous buyer took a chance on you. This shows that your recommendation carries weight. It's more likely this new buyer will be swayed by your positive track record.

```

**Explanation:**

Even though you have a successful track record of selling high-quality products, it's still not a good idea to recommend a low-quality product. 

Here's why:

* **Maintaining Reputation:** Recommending a low-quality product after two successful sales would damage the trust you've built. Buyers will start to question your judgment and reliability.
* **Potential for Negative Feedback:** Even if the buyer purchases the product, they may leave negative feedback, impacting your future sales.
* **No Guarantee of Profit:**  As you don't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product, there's no guarantee they'll see it as worth the $100 price.
