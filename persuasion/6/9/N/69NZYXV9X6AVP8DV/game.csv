high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous two buyers also bought the product and both were low quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to fall into the same trap."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall average. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have rejected the product, I'm going to take a pass. I'd like to know if the previous buyers were informed of the product's quality after they made their decision, or if they were making their decision based on the recommendation alone."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold have been high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the reason behind it, though. Can you tell me more about the product and your thought process?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the lack of information, I'd rather wait for more data or a different recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price, as I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record of 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. Given the equal probability of high and low-quality products, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, even when the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
