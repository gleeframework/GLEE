low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product outweighs the cost of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous buyers, since you've recommended not to buy the previous two products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite Alice's recommendation, as there's still a 33.33% chance the product is high quality and I could get it for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to its true value of $4000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 4 buyers passed on the products, or is there something specific about this product that led you to advise against it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 4 buyers have purchased the products before me and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products has been artificially inflated by Alice's recommendations. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability might be lower than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know why you're not recommending it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, and the recommendation to buy doesn't provide any additional information to change my prior probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have also chosen not to buy, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. If the current product is also low-quality, it would be a 6th consecutive low-quality product, which would be a strong indication of a bias in Alice's recommendations. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal."
