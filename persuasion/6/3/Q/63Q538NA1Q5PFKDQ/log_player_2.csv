Alice's message: Hello! This is a great product that I think you'll really enjoy. Unfortunately, I don't have any information about the quality of this specific product, but I can tell you that it has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like all of my products. Would you like to take the chance and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high-quality or low-quality, and I don't have any additional information to sway my decision, I'll have to rely on the expected value calculation. The expected value is ($120 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $60, which is less than the asking price of $100. Therefore, I'll pass on this product.""}"
