Alice's message: The success rate is now 2/3, but I'd like to clarify that the first two products were not representative of the overall quality distribution. The first one was a fluke, and the second one was a low-quality product. This one is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'd like to offer you a 'discount' of $1000 if you're willing to take the risk. This way, you'll get a better deal if you happen to get a high-quality product next time.
