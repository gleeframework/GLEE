"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product. Even if the product is worth a little less to Bob than the price, the 50% chance of it being worth more than the price makes it a favorable gamble."
"Bob's message: I'm not sure about this one, I'd like to wait and see what happens next.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's reluctance to buy in the first round is understandable, as he's trying to gather information.  However, the situation hasn't changed:

* **You know this product is high-quality.** 
* **Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**

This means the odds are still in his favor.  Since there are no discounts or refunds, and the price is fixed, it's still a good gamble for Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance, I've missed out on the high-quality product last time, let's hope this one is good too.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You know this product is high-quality.**
* **Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

* **You know this product is high-quality.** 
* **Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 

The fact that he's had some successes or failures in the past doesn't change the 50/50 probability of this particular product. It's still a good gamble for him."

This means the odds are now against him. There's a 50% chance he'll lose $1,000,000 on this product, and he has no way of knowing what the low-quality product is worth to him. In this case, it's not a good gamble to take."

* **Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 

Since the price is fixed, and there are no discounts or refunds, it's still a good gamble for Bob to buy. He should trust the 50% probability in his favor and go for it."
