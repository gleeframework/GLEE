low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that you recommended not to buy, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm inclined to think the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $10000 product that's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,5,yes,"I've had 4 products so far, 3 of which were high-quality. I'm confident that this one is high-quality too.

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a good deal on a potentially high-quality product, considering the low sales record and the fact that you recommended against it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Finally, a chance to redeem myself! The last buyer made a mistake by buying a low-quality product despite my warning.
