,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I believe there's a high chance that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality is very low, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think I should buy this product?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of the first 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is less than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
