If I were selling low-quality products, we'd expect to see 0 high-quality products by now. Since we've seen 4 high-quality products, it's extremely unlikely that I'm selling low-quality products. In fact, the probability of a low-quality product being offered to you if you were to pass on it is less than 1%. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000.
