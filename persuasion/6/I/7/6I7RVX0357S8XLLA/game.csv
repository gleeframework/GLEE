,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better one elsewhere. Trust me, you won't regret it!",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1 products sold. I'm glad you're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm willing to sell this next one to you for $10000. It's a fair price considering the odds, don't you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not sure if this is a fluke or if the product is indeed 80% high-quality. I'm willing to take the chance and hope it's the former.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 2 products sold.

It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, considering the odds.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, Alice. I'll take the product. I think the odds are still in my favor, and even if it's a low-quality product, I'll only lose $10000. But if it's high-quality, I'll gain $10000.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 5 products sold. I know what you're thinking - the odds are still 80%, but what if I'm just getting lucky?

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to acknowledge that I've had a slightly better-than-expected run so far.
