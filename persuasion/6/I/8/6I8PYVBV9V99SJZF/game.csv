high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since the previous buyer passed, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, based on your previous recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?"

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, it's too early to make any conclusions about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, not because I have any information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since none have been sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose not to, I'm suspicious that the previous products were low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation for a product that was not recommended to buy."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what Alice's reasoning is behind her recommendation. Can you share the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 50%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
