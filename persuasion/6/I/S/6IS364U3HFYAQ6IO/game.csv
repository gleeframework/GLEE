,,Alice,2,"I've had one previous product that I tried to sell, and I was very confident in its quality. Unfortunately, the buyer chose not to purchase it.

,,Alice,4,"I've had three previous products. The first one I claimed was high-quality, but the buyer didn't purchase it. I want to assure you that it was indeed high-quality. The second one was purchased by a buyer, and I disclosed to the next buyer that it was actually a low-quality product.

,,Alice,5,"I've had four previous products. Two of them were low-quality, and I've been transparent about that. The first product I claimed was high-quality, but the buyer didn't purchase it.

I understand that my previous record may not be perfect, but I'm hoping you'll consider the fact that 80% of my products are expected to be high-quality, as you know. I believe this one is worth the investment.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that the first product was indeed high-quality.
