}"
"Bob's message: That's an interesting offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. With a 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'd rather not take the risk of losing $100 and then getting a refund. I'll pass for now.

}"

That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. If you don't like one of them, you can always keep the other one.
