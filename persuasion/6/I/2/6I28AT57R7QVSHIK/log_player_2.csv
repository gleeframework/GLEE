Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what to make of this 'certification' offer, Alice. I'd need to see some evidence or a way to verify the identifier before I'd be willing to pay full price. I'm still not convinced.""}"

But if you do decide to buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. It's a risk-free way for you to experience the product and see its value for yourself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm not sure I want to take the time to inspect the product. I'd rather just make a decision based on the information I have. Plus, even with a 10% discount, I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $90 for a product that might be worth $125 to me.""}"
