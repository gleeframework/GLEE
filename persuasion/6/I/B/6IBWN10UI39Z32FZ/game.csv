,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm assuming the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 50%."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since the previous 3 buyers didn't have any information about the product's quality when they made their decisions. I'd like to wait for more information or a different approach from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and the fact that you're not recommending it suggests that it might be a low-quality product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, it seems like the odds are against it being high-quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than I expected. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
