I'm not offering any discounts this time, but I'm willing to provide more information: I've sold a total of 4 products so far, and 4 of them have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, but it's likely due to chance. I'm not making any claims about the quality of this product, and you should decide based on the probability of 80%.""

However, I want to highlight that I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 5 of them have been high-quality in the past, but 2 of the last 3 have been low-quality.

I'm not making any claims about the quality of this product, but I'm willing to provide a more nuanced view of the situation. I've sold a total of 6 products, and 6 of them have been high-quality in the past, but 3 of the last 4 have been low-quality.
