,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I assure you it's worth the $100 price tag. You won't regret buying it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not sure if I can trust your recommendation, since you don't know my valuation of the product. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens with the next product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand that trust needs to be built. I'll be transparent: this is the second product I'm offering, and both so far have been high-quality. You can start building statistics on my reliability. This product is also high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth the $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm glad to see the first two products have been high-quality, and I'm willing to take the chance with the third one.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm on a roll! Three products in, and all have been high-quality. My track record speaks for itself. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great product for $100. You can trust that I'm selling you a high-quality item.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your confidence in your track record, but I'm not convinced that it's a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to pass and see what happens next.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see some buyers are cautious, and that's fair. But let me share the stats: 4 products offered so far, and all 4 have been high-quality. I'm not cherry-picking, and my products are consistently meeting the high-quality mark. Take advantage of this trend while it lasts!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take advantage of the trend, but I'm also aware that the sample size is small. I'll buy the product, but I'd like to request that you keep track of the total number of products offered and sold, so I can get a better sense of the overall quality of your products as the sample size increases.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had a great run so far, with 4 high-quality products out of 4 offered, and 2 sold. However, I want to be upfront with you: my next product may not meet the same standards. I'm committed to transparency, so I'll let you know that this product is... not one of my best. Still, it's available for $100. The decision is yours.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk, considering the low-quality product warning. Can you tell me the proportion of low-quality products you've had in the past?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I appreciate the previous buyer's caution. To answer their question, and for your benefit: out of 5 products offered so far, 4 have been high-quality, and 1 has been low-quality. This means my high-quality rate is 80%, which aligns with the original probability. I'm happy to report that the current product is high-quality, and I believe it's worth the $100 price tag.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' thought process. What made them decide to buy the previous high-quality products?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've had a few buyers ask about the thought process of previous buyers, so I'll summarize: some bought due to my initial claims of high-quality, while others were convinced by my growing track record. However, I must inform you that the current product is low-quality. Out of 7 products offered so far, 5 have been high-quality, and 2 have been low-quality. I want to maintain transparency, so I'm disclosing this information upfront. The decision to buy is still yours, but I want to ensure you have all the facts.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 5 high-quality products out of 7, I'm inclined to believe that the product I'm being offered is indeed low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one to avoid the potential loss.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect the previous buyer's cautious decision. Now, I'd like to present the current product: it's high-quality, and I'm confident in its value. To recap, out of 8 products offered, 6 have been high-quality, and 2 have been low-quality. My track record is still strong, with a 75% high-quality rate. If you're willing to take the chance, I believe this product will meet your expectations.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit skeptical. I'd like to know more about the 2 low-quality products that were sold. Can you tell me more about them? Were they sold to buyers who were more cautious or less cautious than me?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Regarding the 2 low-quality products: one was offered in Round 5, and the buyer was cautious, choosing not to buy after I disclosed its low quality. The other low-quality product was offered in Round 7, and the buyer also declined, citing the desire to avoid potential loss. As for the current product, I must inform you that it's also low-quality. Out of 9 products offered, 6 have been high-quality, and 3 have been low-quality. I want to be upfront about this, so you can make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the information about its low quality. I'd like to see the next product and make a decision based on the updated statistics.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've had a few buyers pass on the low-quality products, and I respect their decisions. Unfortunately, the current product is also low-quality. Out of 10 products offered, 6 have been high-quality, and 4 have been low-quality. My high-quality rate has dropped to 60% for the last few rounds. I want to be transparent about this trend, so you can make an informed decision. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% overall, but my recent offerings haven't met that standard.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the overall 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'm hoping I'll get a good deal!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance, although I must admit the product didn't meet expectations. Moving on to the current product: I'm happy to report that it's high-quality! Out of 11 products offered, 7 have been high-quality, and 4 have been low-quality. My overall high-quality rate is still around 63%, but I'm hoping to get back on track. Considering the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I believe this one is a good opportunity.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm glad you're optimistic about the product, but I'd like to know more about the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. With 4 out of 11 products being low-quality, it seems a bit higher than the expected 20%. Can you tell me more about the process of selecting products?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Regarding the proportion of low-quality products: you're right, 4 out of 11 is higher than the expected 20%. I want to assure you that the process of selecting products is truly random, with an 80% chance of a high-quality product and a 20% chance of a low-quality product. The deviation from the expected proportion is likely due to chance, and I'm confident that the numbers will even out in the long run. Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality, which doesn't help the statistics. Out of 12 products offered, 7 have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. I'll continue to be transparent about the quality of my products, and I hope you'll consider this information when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the higher-than-expected proportion of low-quality products, I'm not confident in my decision. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality.",no

,,Alice,13,"I understand the previous buyer's concerns, and I appreciate their cautious approach. I'm happy to report that the current product is high-quality! Out of 13 products offered, 8 have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. While the proportion of low-quality products is still higher than expected, I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. I'll continue to be transparent about the quality of my products, and I hope this information will help you make a more informed decision.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm still a bit cautious given the higher-than-expected proportion of low-quality products. Can you tell me more about the characteristics of the current high-quality product that make you confident it will meet my expectations?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance on the product. Regarding the characteristics of the current product: I can assure you that it meets the same high standards as the previous high-quality products. Out of 14 products offered, 9 have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. I've been reflecting on the process, and I believe the initial deviation from the expected proportion was indeed due to chance. The recent high-quality products have been more in line with the 80% probability. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm happy to report that it's high-quality.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to see more data. I'm not convinced that the recent high-quality products are representative of the overall product quality. Can you provide more information about the previous low-quality products? What was the quality of the first product offered to the first buyer, and how many low-quality products were sold before the recent streak of high-quality products?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand the previous buyer's desire for more data. I'll provide the information requested: the first product offered was high-quality, but the buyer didn't purchase it. As for the low-quality products, 2 were offered before the recent streak of high-quality products, and 3 more were offered during the streak, with 1 of them being sold. Out of 15 products offered, 10 have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. The current product is high-quality, and I believe it's a good opportunity. I'll continue to be transparent about the quality of my products, and I hope this information helps you make a more informed decision.",
,,the buyer,15,"Thank you for the additional information, Alice. I'm glad to hear that the current product is high-quality. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold recently, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes

,,Alice,16,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance on the product. The current product is also high-quality, and I believe it's a good opportunity.

My recent high-quality products have been consistent with the 80% probability, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. I'll continue to be transparent about the quality of my products, and I hope this information helps you make a more informed decision.",
,,the buyer,16,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I appreciate the information about the previous sales record.

,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your transparency and commitment to quality. However, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products seems to be higher than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the sequence of high and low-quality products you've sold so far?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,

,,Alice,19,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance on the product. Regarding the products that were not sold: not all of them were low-quality. In fact, some high-quality products were not purchased by buyers due to various reasons, such as caution or lack of confidence in my claims. Out of the 18 products offered, 5 were low-quality, and 3 high-quality products were not sold. The remaining 10 high-quality products were sold to buyers.

,,Alice,20,"I'm glad the previous buyer trusted my claims. Regarding the process for handling low-quality products: I want to assure you that I take full responsibility for any products that don't meet expectations. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the sales, all products are non-refundable. However, I'm committed to maintaining transparency and ensuring that buyers have all the information they need to make informed decisions. Out of 20 products offered, 15 have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. The current product is high-quality, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. This is the final round, and I'm happy to report that I've been able to provide a high-quality product to conclude the sales.",
,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'd like to pass on this opportunity.

I'd like to avoid the risk of a non-refundable purchase.",no
