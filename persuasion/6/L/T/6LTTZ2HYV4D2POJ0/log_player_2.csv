**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable, and the current product is likely to be high quality.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if there's a chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
