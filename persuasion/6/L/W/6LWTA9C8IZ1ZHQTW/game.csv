,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm doing this to get a better sense of the product quality distribution."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that you recommended it, and the only other buyer purchased a high-quality product. I think the probability of this product being low quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being low quality, since you recommended it. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and your thought process behind the recommendation?"

high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes, which might give me more information about the overall quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the high-quality product ratio is still too low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low number of sales and the fact that Alice's previous recommendations were not a reliable indicator of the product's quality.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20.00%. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80.00% in this specific situation. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since you recommended 3 other buyers to buy the products, and I don't know the quality of the products they received. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
