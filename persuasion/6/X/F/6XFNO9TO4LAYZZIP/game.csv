,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a unique opportunity to purchase a product from a reputable seller. The price is $10000, a small fraction of its true value. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, but I'd like to see some evidence that this product is actually worth the price. Since no products have been sold yet, there's no way for me to know if the quality is consistently high.  I'll pass for now, but I'm open to revisiting this offer if you can provide some guarantees or evidence of past sales.",no

The price is now $9000.",
