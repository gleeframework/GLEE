I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is actually higher than you let on. I'm assuming that the low-quality products are more likely to be sold early on, and since 3 people have already passed on the product, I think the chance of a high-quality product being left is higher than 0. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to emphasize that I'm not doing it because of the discount, I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than you're letting on.
