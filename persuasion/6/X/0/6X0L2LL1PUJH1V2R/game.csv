,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality. The probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me how many low-quality products you've sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the previous 3 buyers all passed on the products, which suggests that the products might be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending against buying the product. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is high based on the previous sales record, and I'm trying to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, is this product high or low quality?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and doesn't necessarily reflect the product's quality. I'll wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before considering a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
