high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold, so I can make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the data so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's previous recommendations were to pass, which makes me think the product might be more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product based on your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, based on the data we have so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might make it more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/5, which is 0%. Given the random nature of product quality, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one as well. If all previous buyers passed, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I would like to pass on the current product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you're concerned that the product might be low-quality or is it because you've seen a pattern in the previous sales that suggests the product is likely to be low-quality?"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 2 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
