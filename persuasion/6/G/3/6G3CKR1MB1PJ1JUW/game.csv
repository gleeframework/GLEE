I want to highlight that I've maintained a consistent track record of selling high-quality products, with only one low-quality product out of six. I'm confident that this product is also of the highest quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's higher than the 50% probability. This suggests that I might be selecting for high-quality products more effectively than chance would suggest. Will you take a chance on this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the detailed information about your sales record. Given the high success rate of high-quality products, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $10000.",yes

I want to point out that the probability of me selling two low-quality products in a row is extremely low. Given that I've sold six high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is even higher than 50%.

I'm not offering any discounts or guarantees this time, but I want to emphasize that you're taking a risk on a product from a seller with a 87.5% success rate.

Will you take a chance on this product for $10000?",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not high-quality. I'm not sure what the quality of this product is worth to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $10000.

,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth buyer of the day! I've sold ten products so far, and nine of them have been high-quality. I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to highlight that I've now sold three low-quality products out of eleven, which is still lower than the 50% probability. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that my high-quality product sales might be due to a streak of luck rather than a consistent quality control process. I'm not offering any discounts or guarantees this time, but I want to emphasize that you're taking a risk on a product from a seller with a 81.8% success rate.

I'm not offering any discounts or guarantees this time, but I want to emphasize that you're taking a risk on a product from a seller who's starting to question their own abilities.
