Alice's message: You've seen that the first product was high-quality, but that was a one-time guarantee. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%.

At this point, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly higher than 80%. However, I'm still only offering it to you for $10000.
