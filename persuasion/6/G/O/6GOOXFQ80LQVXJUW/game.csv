high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"Out of the 15 previous products, 11 were high-quality and I recommended all of them. Two low-quality products were bought, one in Round 3 and one in Round 11, both of which I did not recommend. Unfortunately, no high-quality products have been sold yet. However, my recommendations have been accurate. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Consider this when making your decision. Buying this product could be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product. To answer your question, given that 11 out of 15 products were high-quality, the empirical probability of a product being high-quality is around 73.3%. However, it's essential to note that this is a relatively small sample size, and the true probability is still 80%."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice recommended it to me may indicate that it's a low-quality product, given that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change.",
