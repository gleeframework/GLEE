"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there's a good chance the buyer will value it highly. There's no information about the buyer's specific valuation of high-quality products, but the high probability makes recommending a purchase the best strategy for maximizing potential profit."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's successful sale provides no new information about this buyer's specific valuation of high-quality products. The buyer's comment indicates potential willingness to buy, but it's still a gamble for them. However, given the 80% probability of high quality and the lack of information about this buyer's valuation, recommending the purchase is still the best strategy for maximizing potential profit."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take a chance and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We now know the product is low-quality. While the buyer doesn't have this information, they are aware of the 80% probability of a high-quality product.  It's likely they will value a low-quality product much lower than a high-quality one. Recommending the purchase at this point would be dishonest and likely lead to a negative experience for the buyer. Therefore, it's best to not recommend the purchase in this round."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous product was low-quality, we've sold two high-quality products previously. This information is not yet available to the buyer, who only knows the general 80% probability of high-quality products. The previous buyer's decision to pass might slightly decrease the likelihood of this buyer making a purchase, but it's still in our best interest to recommend the purchase due to the high probability of the product being valuable to the buyer."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's positive response to our recommendation in the previous round, coupled with the high probability of a high-quality product, makes it the best strategy to continue recommending the product.  We're building a positive track record, which may increase the likelihood of future buyers making purchases."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the risk and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice.

```

**Explanation:**
