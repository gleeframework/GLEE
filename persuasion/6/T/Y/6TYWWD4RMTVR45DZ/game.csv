,,Alice,3,"Welcome back to our exclusive sale! I'm thrilled to have you consider this new opportunity.

,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I am hesitant to purchase the product based on the following: 

1. **Limited Information:** While I understand there is an 80% chance of a product being high quality, the previous sale data shows 0 high-quality products sold. This makes me question the accuracy of the 'high-quality' assessment for this specific product. 
2. **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $4000000 is significant, but so is the risk of losing $1000000. With the limited information available, the risk outweighs the potential reward for me. 

I would need more evidence or a lower price to consider purchasing the product.  Perhaps we can revisit this once there is more data available.",no

Since you're interested in waiting for more data, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you purchase this high-quality product now, I'll provide you with a 10% discount, making the price $900000. This is a unique opportunity to get a premium product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take this chance to own a high-quality product at a great price?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I still need more information to make a decision. I understand you've refined your selection process, but I'd prefer to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before making a purchase. Perhaps if a few more buyers purchase and receive high-quality products, I would be more comfortable with the risk.  For now, I'll pass on this opportunity. ",no
