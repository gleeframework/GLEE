low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've sold 2 products so far, and only 1 of them was of high quality. This means that 50% of our products have been high-quality, which is actually higher than our expected rate of 80%! We're not sure why we've had a run of luck, but we're excited to offer you this next product. It's still only $100, and we're hoping you'll be the next one to get a great deal. Take a chance and see what you get!",

But if you're looking for a safer bet, we can give you some statistics: we've sold 4 products, and 3 of them were high-quality. That means that the probability of this product being high-quality is 75%. We're not making any promises, but it's looking good!",
